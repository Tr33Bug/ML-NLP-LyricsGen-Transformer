1529,"When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
Well all the people have got their problems
That aint nothing new

I feel my temperature rising

I wouldnt build just anything
And if I was a ball player
I wouldnt play no second string
And if I were some jewelry baby

If I were a secret Lord I never would be told
If I were a jug of wine Lord my flavor would be old
I could be most anything
But it got to be twentyfour karat solid gold oh

And if I were a guitar player
Lord Id have to play the blues

3992,"Never quit until the clock stops
And never die out until your heart drops
Success will separate you from the havenots
And have all these haters at your neck like an ascot
You could do it too young world
I remember being exactly like you young girl
But wait you could do it too young man
See youll be fine as long as on your own two you stand
Keep on living keep on breathing
Even when you dont believe it
Keep on climbing keep on reaching
Even when this world cant see it
No impossible is nothing
Even when you dont believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world cant see it
Impossible is nothing
Got to hate to not have it more than you love to obtain it
Your futures around the corner so close you can almost taste it
It get worse before its better that storm you gone have to weather
Either be a busted pipe or a diamond due to this pressure
25 hours 8 days out the week
Focus keep eyes open victory never sleeps
My prayers for you is that you hit all them goals you trynna reach
I even hope at one point that you take it farther than me
Keep on living keep on breathing
Even when you dont believe it
Keep on climbing keep on reaching
Even when this world cant see it
No impossible is nothing
Even when you dont believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world cant see it
Impossible is nothing
I shall never let em see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
And never sell out my soul for any number on a cheque
I shall never let em see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
Just promise me when Im gone you wont forget

But we have a bond that is not to be broken

Push me inside you no other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy Ill make you feel good I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should

7208,"What yall want 
Unconditional love no doubt 
Talkin about the stuff that dont wear off it dont fade
Itll last for all these crazy days these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you still feel you
Still there for you no matter what hehe 
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love
Come listen to my truest thoughts my truest feelings
All my peers doin years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see its hard to live this life without God
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room hey 
One day I hope to make it a player in this game
Mama dont cry long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps its just a fantasy
A life where we dont need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe its me that caused it the fightin and the hurtin
In my room cryin because I didnt wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I aint worried bout a damn thing with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
Just got the message youve been callin all week
Been out here hustlin on these streets
Aint had a chance to speak
But you know with you and me its all G
We could never be enemies
Cause youve been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it aint easy bein who we are
Driven by my ambitions desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of todays generation if I could make em listen
Prison aint what we need no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan strategize my familys gotta eat
We work somethin out of nothin
No pleasure in the sufferin
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin
The liquor and the weed the cussin
Sendin love out to my block
The struggle never stops unconditional love 
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
Ill probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin to change your ways
While gettin paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin inside please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe its the way I played it in my heart
I know one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes so many vivid pictures
And all the currency Ill never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters cause after all the lights and screams nothin but my dreams matter
Hopin for better days maybe a peaceful night
Baby dont cry cause everything gon be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Dont worry bout a thing baby girl Im a soldier huh 
Never treated me bad no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love
repeat to fade 
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love

Some cat was layin down some rock n roll

Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That werent no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive
Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hed like to come and meet us
But he thinks hed blow our minds
Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows its all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey thats far out so you heard him too
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Dont tell your poppa or hell get us locked up in fright

But we didnt come to see no jealous ass niggas
We came to keep the party hype and drank up all the liquor
And fuck with the gold diggers them free drink sippers
Cause them gone be the ones in the room pulling zippers
With they teeth mind blow by the presidential suite
Waking up talking bout they wanna go and eat

Peekin out the curtain of yo mini shirt

A saddle on yo chest I expect nothing less

It looks as if to me you got some handles bout yourself
But everything you struggle to reach is up on the shelf
In homes of pimps who done done it

Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a manchild would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
Look at your career they said
Lauryn baby use your head
But instead I chose to use my heart
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion Zion Zion 
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion Zion uhh Zion 
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zions door
Ive never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And Im reminded every time I see your face

Rarrraaaahahhhh

What happened Ahhrrrahhh
Rrrrah
Now we got me
My man Chubb Rock over this Prince Paul beat
Yo Chubb you start it off we gonna freak it
Cmon
Verse One Chubb Rock
Here we go
To the consumer and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I come backwards on stuff you dont deny
If you try to act fly then Ill punk you I and I
When I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise to invade the media shame
Take it insult call me the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lees a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it OJ he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid the drug addict
If you missed me dont kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one
Verse Two BizMarkie
Ladahdi ladahda I like to say
You know me as the inhuman orchestra
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW
Guaranteed to rock and shock and clock and
Oh I made you say ow yes
You hear me rockin you hear me clockin
You hear people jockin
Is it because Im like smart like Mr Spock and
Captain Kirk and you know Im workin
Im bound to wreck your body go OWWW I go bezerk and
You always hearin you always clearin you always cheerin

The original here to rock and get respected
Im Markie heh the MahhZayRKay
The man appointed rap King and Im here to stay
Im down to wreck your body Im not here to scrub
I gotta pass it over to my man Chubb
Verse Three Chubb Rock
From the glass clear era thats the point of the one
Be unique critique from the crumb me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it cheerio kid and here I go
Off beat slackin but the platinum mediocre rappers
With the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The acoustic suits it the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs well it should Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise super star in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild child in the rubadub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out with my rubber band
I can tell that you need me you dont want me to get paunchy
And me I dont want to catch no HIV
So well protect you and me but mainly me
If you dont want no rubber then PEACE

The whole Staten Island shitting on you
Wisdom Birds pregnant out in Baisley
Holding snow in your ear fresh baldie tried to change up
Not truck today still looking fly still slammed up hung

You disgust me screwing me down grab my gun
Go head bust me

6581,"Runnin Dying to Live Lyrics
Between you and Biggie it was like whos gonwhos gon who rules the nigga kingdom and shit basically you know what Im saying I was like this is like a fucking
It is that
Election Its an election and shit
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggies situation is smaller than that Me and Biggies situation is like
You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
You dont know 
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die
Check it I grew up a fuckin screwup
Got introduced to the game got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that
Nigga Im too fat I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
Thats why I bust back it dont faze me
When he drop take his Glock and Im Swayze
Celebrate my escape sold the Glock bought some weight
Lay back I got some money to make motherfucker
You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die
Its on me 
But still Im havin memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushin the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole worlds tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do
But stay true sippin 22s of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin questions tryna stress me
Misery is all I see thats my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes slipped got arrested and flipped
He screamed Thug Life and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin from the police
You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die
They wanted a new regime And my regime includes East coast includes West coast
I was more shocked than anything
You know what Im sayin
But I wasnt more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him Pac is a strong dude yo
I know dude you know what Im sayin Real strong
So when they was like he got shot I was just more like Again you know what Im sayin
He always getting shot or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it and its going to be over
You know what Im sayin
But when he when he died I was just like whoa you know what Im saying Kinda took me by
I mean even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what Im sayin
Because there aint no coming back from that
",dumb but we had heart In the dark will we survive through the bad parts Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes No hesitation in extermination of these snitches Envious bitches they still continue to pursue me A couple of movies now the whole worlds tryna screw me Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do But stay true sippin 22s of brew And now media is tryna test me Got the press askin questions tryna stress me Misery is all I see thats my mind state My history with the police will shake the crime rate My main man had two strikes slipped got arrested and flipped He screamed Thug Life and emptied the clip Got tired of runnin from the police You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die They wanted a new regime And my regime includes East coast includes West coast I was more shocked than anything You know what Im sayin But I wasnt more shocked of him dying I was more shocked of him Pac is a strong dude yo I know dude you know what Im sayin Real strong So when they was like he got shot I was just more like Again you know what Im sayin He always getting shot or shot at He going to pull through this one again Make a few records about it and its going to be over You know what Im sayin But when he when he died I was just like whoa you know what Im saying Kinda took me by I mean even though we was going through our drama I would never wish death on nobody You know what Im sayin Because there aint no coming back from that,Runnin Dying to Live Lyrics Between you and Biggie it was like whos gonwhos gon who rules the nigga kingdom and shit basically you know what Im saying I was like this is like a fucking It is that Election Its an election and shit It is that You know what I am saying Me and Biggies situation is smaller than that Me and Biggies situation is like You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight You dont know Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Check it I grew up a fuckin screwup Got introduced to the game got a ounce and fuckin blew up Choppin rocks overnight The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White We had to grow dreads to change our description Two cops is on the milk box missin Show they toes you know they got stepped on A fistful of bullets a chest full of Teflon Run from the police picture that Nigga Im too fat I fuck around and catch a asthma attack Thats why I bust back it dont faze me When he drop take his Glock and Im Swayze Celebrate my escape sold the Glock bought some weight Lay back I got some money to make motherfucker You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Its on me But still Im havin memories of high speed when the cops crashed As I laugh pushin the gas while my Glocks blast We was young and we was

The last time I asked you I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen
You see em goin down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more
Say it 
Tell me what you want
Yeah Ill do it Baby I promise right now
Say it 
Who propped you up when you were stopped
Low motivation had you on the ground
I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide Away goodbye

A thousand reasons why you have to say it isnt so
It Isnt So 
Now Say It isnt So

But if Im faced with being replaced

Into the spotlight one more time
Just in time to play
To one man and an empty table
He was drinking down the pain
All he could say was this ladys name
Oh camellia wont you take me away
After the show when the room was empty
No he wouldnt go
So I asked him why he called her name
It seems she was some magic one night
With something for his pain
But all she left was a pretty name
Oh camellia wont you take me away
To paradise tropical moon
Dont you leave me sitting here in Atlanta

Notice I havent yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through and make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through
Youre everything send your soul through your lips to my heart
Sweet musicll start I want you to be the muse for my art
When people try to rip us apart we gotta work to stay together
Go through the seasons of love and never change with the weather

722,"Thats Old Fashioned Thats the Way Love Should Be LyricsWe hold hands in the movie show
So they say that were old fashioned
Or we stroll beneath the silvry moon oooooooon
And we carve our initials in the old oak tree

Where we play the nickelodeon ahahahahn
And we dance when we hear our favorite melody
Thats old fashioned thats the way love should be
Its a modern changing world
Everything is moving fast
But when it comes to love I like
What they did in the past
Im the kind who loves only one
So the boys say Im old fashioned
Let them laugh honey I dont miiiiind
Ive made plans for a wedding day for you and me

But the fire is so delightful
And since weve no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
It doesnt show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How Ill hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home Ill be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear were still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
He doesnt care if its in below
Hes sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He dont care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let It Snow 
OoooohWee goes the storm
Why should he worry when hes nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says Let it snow let it snow
I Dont Care 
The weather outside Is frightful
But that fire Is ummm delightful
Since weve no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
It doesnt show signs of stopping
And Ive brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow

7789,"Intro Talib Kweli 
Yo were going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So whenever you hear the word love
Know that its going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated yo
Verse 1 Talib Kweli 
Love is blind you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin the night life lookin for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic then got to frantic
Then things thats normally small become gigantic
Now yall sinkin like the Titanic here come the panic
Being with you like a habit without you I cant stand it
Its tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin a nut off communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned on wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We dont smile anymore and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo see what Im sayin
Its like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife bitches say niggas is
We just dont understand our fundamental differences
Im still learning though actually
I just do what come naturally naturally naturally
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve And I found you 
Verse 2 Talib Kweli 
Women thrive on emotions men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say word
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo wherever you want to go lovell take you there
Lets go you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun thats where Im comin from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin over drums
Word te quiero I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart youre livin in your ocean Im swimmin in
Never drowning got me floatin watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin approachin
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust Ill always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out Ill show you how it could be
Love different language it aint nuttin but a word
A chicken aint nuttin but a bird
Yo yo yo
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve And I found you 
Verse 3 Talib Kweli 
Some of yall in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal thats why Im feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
Thats what your beauty remind me of
Its hard to find a love like ours taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and thats a different thing
Anything but Queen Ill go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you aint got a band
But they dont understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they aint privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language they speak from pain and anguish
Some dont love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like Shit he payin for your rent missin the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
Its more than pillow talk it cant be translated
Learn how to speak it and become emancipated
Its a language
Universal love
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es Stay because I love you as you are

6674,"Take it to the top
Yea thats where we at with it hah
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character uh
Dont mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready Lets go
A wise man know what he know and what he doesnt
If hes not really sure what hes saying he dont discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective but his biblehood never questioned
A dying man will make a confession try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get posttraumatic stress disorder become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
Hell bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth
His word is his bond but his actions always the proof
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Lets go
Sometimes its hard to believe
In what you dont see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
Its hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open
Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down thunderstorm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce now Im back like Im Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday my twenties went in the bowl
Forgive me Lord for them bitches the night before
Business deals and the Bentleys I cant afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones on the gone it was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed therefore I spark
Recite the Quran Im in the dark
Devil knocking on my door he like a narc
Sometimes its hard to believe
In what you dont see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
Its hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open
No excuses if I start it then Ill see it through
God is what I see in you so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TVs true The media deceiving you
They misrepresenting misquoting then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing in case youre wondering
If they want the ring they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe but I back it up with what I know oh 
Its the facts versus the facts simile your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments in Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire I walked through the Devils fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a beast with this rhyming
Thats where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
Lets go
Sometimes its hard to believe
In what you dont see or understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
Its hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action

Knives and swords lions tigers bitin boars
Lightening striking Viking hordes
Fighting heightened violence soars

Well thats cause you aint Lu bitch
Took two sips of the holy grail

Mic check mic check 12 12
Made a lot of mishaps lot of mistakes lot of missteps
Grown shit though is when you can recognize that
And I recognize that and real recognize that
Talk to em
Last word check it unbeatable force insurmountable object
Bull shouldve known better than counting me out Im from the projects
So if I ever do it for greed indeed something is wrong
Prepare for the future remember I used to get heat from the oven on
They wanted to see Budden gone fiendd out on sour
But nobody helped put Budden on had to bring my own power so
Im having a private party that only myself attends
And if the DJ plays the song to my soul itll give itself a cleanse
They telling me all the pain I ever felt was selfinfringed
But I had help from friends one even held the syringe
Architect of my own path Id like to think its designed the best
Defied the odds I never aged while giving time a test
No niggas on house arrest Im on a minor rest
You trying to call me or text me dont even bother
Im trying to give mind a rest
I got a treasure but its content is invisible
Was filled before with shit that I thought I treasured but made me miserable
My affairs together here forever yeah Im back to work
Learned in order to lose love probably gotta have it first
My lifes a crap shoot my dice are loaded aint no stopping me
Most interesting man a hard place is between a rock and me
Im torn within and my eyes are heavy
Im born again just means I died already
Means I survived already so fuck they want with me
World been against me so long misery hates my company
Isolated my whole life not many know who Joseph is
In order to reciprocate love you gotta notice it
Gotta recognize it gotta feel it first
Gotta be let inside it feel its hurt and then kneel to its worst
If you contain it dont hide it gotta reveal it first
And when you think you hit rock bottom gotta feel it worse
Or my rule book is just dated
And for you to truly appreciate it you gotta at least be hated
Mama I made it if anyone know my way was hard
They prayed for my Downfall on deaf ears I was praying to God
So God I loved love till it resented me
And if its still a stranger then I love who it pretends to be
No Love Lost
No love found
They found a little bit though
I dont know where they found it out but it was there
So I guess the moral of the story
Is as you mature so will it
Just gotta find it

6077,"You Know Im NoÂ Good Lyrics
Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull Tshirt
You say why did you do it with him today
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray
Why you acting like you more trouble than Tony Starks n
You need to just walk away like Kelly Clarkson
I know we was free to sleep around town
But I figured you said that cause how I get down
Not cause you was out there messing around
I would of told you once you go Ghost you never go back
Try ging me like I dont know how to mack
Im a don top of the line I stay flying
Stop trying to keep covering the lies and
Using my credit cards to buy diamonds
We need to straighten this out get to the bottom of it all
Lets go before we start the war
Begin with two reasons why we need to talk
And stop popping up in my cribs all over New York
And thats stalking you such trouble and no good
Them fighting words in my block when we in the hood
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
You had to be a nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl nasty girl try to play me
Ayo I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperatures so hot the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again cause of old boy
But oh boy together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh what a web we weave
But you played me so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down holding the next mans stacks
Now you sorry tryin bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
Its a shame how you cant get me off the brain
Hear that lame You love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name thats right Im high post
Get the champagne love word up we gon toast
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
You had to be nasty girl and try to play me
Nasty girl girl
You cant leave the kid cant leave the kid
Dont worry Imma be around forever nasty girl
Dont forget Imma be around forever nasty
Sweet reunion Jamaica and Spain
Were like how we were again
Im in the tub youre on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Yo get the bath and body works pumkin and spice creams
Together like Cheech and Chong we make nice dreams
Fight scenes I take the good with the bad
Cause you give the best brains that I ever had and
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So lets stick it out so we never regret it
I could forgive the past but I never forget it
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good

5001,"Yeah from BK to the world Ive had enough
Nowadays a range aint big enough Moschino aint jig enough
Im kind of iced out but my chain aint thick enough
Album aint hot enough label said its not enough
Singing in the hook I need to change my look
My rims aint big enough chrome dont shine enough
I shopped Fifth Fab but I still cant find enough
Iceberg to swerve dont dress gay enough
No airplay so I guess I aint pay enough
Cristale dont cost enough and I still aint lost enough
Money on these chickens that said I dont floss enough
Album barely gold guess I aint try enough
Video wasnt fly enough budget wasnt high enough
And I aint lie enough about crack sales and jails
Yall feeling me like braille well I still got no sales
Must aint sold enough cause my heart aint cold enough
Said I was Born 2 Roll they said I aint roll enough
Guess I got to brag more must dont boast enough
Aint New York enough aint West Coast enough
But thats fine cause Imma focus on mine
Im hoping that 2009 is enough time
Wrote enough rhymes to be on album number fifty
Youll see how Im on it if you hung enough with me
The rap games a book and Ive read mad chapters
And if you ask me it aint enough mad rappers
Somebody tell me what the deal is I had enough
Niggas got to know its for real
Niggas only rocking them jewels for you to see
Like Ghostface nigga dont front for me
Enough is enough we gon start calling your bluff
Watching your moves we gon be all in your stuff
Fuck around and come through rocking enough ice
Looking nice in high price niggas is nuff shiest
Guess it aint enough thugs enough drugs on the streets
And niggas aint busting enough slugs
Not enough Caucasians know what stress is
Project girls rock vests not dresses
Enough lessons learned play with fire get burned
Enough dough get made none of it earned
Enough wilding fuck that yo enough smiling
I rep Brooklyn Manhattan Staten Island
Queens plus the BX not enough Tecs
Not enough cops killing us all for paychecks
Enough of this enough of that enough crap
Enough wack radio stations said enough rap
And they got the nerve to try to flaunt it
Will my album get enough buzz if theres enough niggas on it
When we in the house its like its haunted
We got you shook mad niggas from the Brook look
Enough cats crack Mos and mack hoes
Enough cats with wack flows pack shows
Enough of these enough of those it never slows
It just grows your girl dont wear enough clothes
These nobrainers are lost entertainers
Get found on Billboards greatest sale gainers
Enough Beems and Benz enough fly honies with dime friends
That want to juice you for your ends
Its getting rough whole lot of intricate stuff
Mad crime dog like McGruff enoughs enough

But its better than not being alive from straps
Agreed a Mead notebook and a Bic that click when its pushed
And a wack ass beat
Thats a track thats weak that he got last week
Cause everybody in the stu was like Thats that heat
A bassheavy medley with a sample from the 70s
With a screwedup hook that went Stack that cheese
Somethin somethin somethin Stack that cheese
Mother sister cousin Stack that cheese
He couldnt think of nothin Stack that cheese
He turns down the beat writers block impedes

Glow like Leroy you should see boy go
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on the row
Best homie in the grave tatted up while in the cage
Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby mama who he really had to honor
Cause she was his biggest fan even let him use her Honda
To drive up to Dallas went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on he gon take her to the Galleria
Buy her everything but the mannequins ya dig

His man called said Your time might be now
They played your freestyle over Wipe Me Down
They played it two times said it might be crowned
As the best thing out the HTown in a while
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good have her rolling like she should
Show his homies theres a way other than that flippin yay
Bail his homie out of jail put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school show the shorties that its cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy chuck the deuce and act a fool

Rarely do you see the Phoenix rise from the ashes
Lightnin struck twice on four classics
Selfpreservation we separate ourselves from the plastic
The ankle of my sweat still elastic still do gymnastics
If Hovs still forever young
Then Ima somersault backwards through these chapters
Land in th softwhite cook it till its offwhite
They qustionin my scorecard hold it to a torch light
I hid it in the porch light see I had the foresight
My 911 was pullin up to matchin Porsche night ooh
The married drug dealer even named my son Brixx
He raps what he lives so fuck the nanny gon sit
Its the grown man in me
Searchin for the plug thats the nomad in me
Still the X factor thats the Rohan in me
Reluctantly a role model
That drowned in too many gold bottles
Harold Melvin without the Blue Notes
The past ten years screamin Uno
Then side step back into the duo
The kings of the Pyrex
Im my brothers keeper if you listen and you dissect
All I talk is money if you listen to my dialect
Bitch I shot Grindin in my mommas mommas projects
Im just being honest with you how is that for context
You can live forever when the shit you write is timeless
We gon live forever cause the shit we write is timeless

I dont Hellcat still paddle when I shift
Vietnam flashbacks I get triggered by a sniff
Todays top fives only strengthenin my myth
Belong on Rushmore just from chiselin a brick
Still fightin demons see that curse is now my gift
Secrets die with me thats as deep as the abyss that is no coincidence
When I was in the mix opened up your nose like Im cuttin it with Vicks
Slavin over stoves like I rub together sticks
Paved another road so my soul would coexist
But Heaven only knows I wont dig another ditch
In a suit and tie like you puttin on the ritz
Three record deals show me ignorance was bliss
Tryna milk a game that is only two percent
X told you Hell is hot I told you Repent
Faith never waivered as I walked along the fence
Faith moves mountains so what are you up against
Watch my brother round you bitches I know he pretends
I greet you with the love of God that dont make us friends
I might whisper in his ear Bury all of them
Light another tiki torch and carry it again
Back up on my high horse its chariots again
Put the ring back on her finger marry it again

7514,"Ms Fat Booty Lyrics
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
Man duke I was in love with this girl duke
I was tore up dog Im tellin you man
Shit is wild man for real
Its shes from let me tell you about her
Yo in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped money clip phone flip the six range
I seen her on the Ave spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants hot damn
Whats your name love Where you came from
Neck and wrist laced up very little makeup
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
I tried to play it low key but couldnt keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like Yo Im leavin now
An hour later sounds from Jamaica
Shes sippin Cris straight up skankin windin her waist up
Scene 2 my fams throwin a jam
Fareed is on the stand big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
Ayo this my man Mos baby let me introduce
I turned around Say word 
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin to play me for the herb Yeah thats her 
Shocked as hell she couldnt get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin Oh Im fine my name is Mos Im Sharice
I heard so much good about you its nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin directly next to me
Im type polite but now Im lookin at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes sweet voice is fuckin with me mentally
We conversated made her laugh yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo she wild sweet yo
Im bout to murk I say peace to the family
She hop up like How you gon leave before you dance with me
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
I know I cant afford to stop
For one moment that its too soon to forget
She blew my whole head with that duke I was like word
I played it low though
I was like yeah aight come on then lets go
Niggas was mad niggas was so sick I tell ya 
Yo honey was so blazin she was just
Yo she looked like Jayne Kennedy word bond to my mother man
She was that ill man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin to me
Yo let me apologize for the other night I know it wasnt right
But baby you know what its like some brothers dont be comin right
I understand Im feelin you
Besides Can I have a dance aint really that original
We laughed about it traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin Lovers Rock I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered Honey lets exchange numbers
Scene 3 weeks of datin late night conversation
In the crib heart racin tryin to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids the room fell silent
She walked away smilin singin Gregory Isaacs
Like If I dont if I dont have you
Showin me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin Sade Sweetest Taboo
Burnin candles all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my JO Come now I cant say no
Ginseng tree trunks rockin the Pfunk
Cockin her knees up champion lover not ease up
Three months she call I feel Im runnin a fever
Six months Im tellin her I desperately need her
Nine months flulike symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down Im really tryin to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know sweetheart I got to have it
She tellin me commitment is somethin she cant manage
Wake up the next mornin she gone like it was magic
Aww damn it My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911s unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week Mu hit me up I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin ass Asian playin lay it down and lick me up
What

And Im freezing blue with misery
You know that I never meant to hurt you
But something always gets right in the way
So Ill fill this bedrom full of mystery
Hang our last conclusions on the wall
And if this empty building starts to get to me
Please remember that it just might be your fault
Better to have lost in love
Than never to have loved at all
So the fated lovers turn to enemies 
And all their hidden feelings start to show
And I never though that boy

5213,"So Appalled FreestyleRemix Lyrics
So sick of it
Run up in your crib just for the sake of stickin it
Yeah Im ridiculous
I know this is Kanyes track but Im kissin it
Still laughin at these cats like Im ticklish
Just somethin about that shit I like flippin it
The worlds back on my dick Im Mike Vickn it
Cock back and squeeze only right that you squirt off
Soon as I leave the building they turn the alert off
Only thing I need to know is can you knock the work off
Fifth Ave spendin crack money up in Bergdorf
Leave that boy alone I wouldnt recommend it
Half a mil worth of VVs independent
Everything is splendid all fine and dandy
Hoodrich is one point nine off the candy
sweat suit thermal on with the 
Grilled tilapia steamed salmon or the scampi
Snakes still squirmin haze off sherm and
Block is like the nickel boy days in the Vernon
Chrome fourfifn cause they still snitchin
The pools in the living room swim to the kitchen
Im so appalled Im better than em all
I rip an arena just like a hole in the wall
Spend a few stacks on some hoes in the mall
Real niggas is either in the hole or the morgue
Enemies is cool loved onesll hurt you
Dishonor before death yeah viceversa
Elegant performance my stash is enormous
Real talk New Yorks been mine for the longest
Strong onesll make it weak onesll suffocate
I keep it in the hood so its easy to resuscitate
Lifes like a milk crate nothin like a beach kid
Good cardigan over the Trues nice feetwear
Yeah
Yeah
Hustle like an African mother from the motherland
Work in the ziplock money in the rubber band
If the cops dont blitz then Im lucky
I want the eighth floor of the Ritz like Nucky
Empire like AC from KC
Kitchen cook step up in the spot all the bitches look
Eastbound down like Kenny Powers
Bricks is in the Dodge Neon but its Hemipowered any hour
This could be a sevendigit flip
Send a kite to the bing to get seven niggas ripped
Get the top ten list and get seven niggas clipped
I used to just ride on the seven bus
Now I let it bubble like SevenUp
That was five sevens you could die with a three in front
Need money need pussy need liquor need a blunt
Wanna fuck with me nigga You gon need a gun
Money over bitches but respect over money though
Loyaltyll have you on the boat to the bungalow
What you know about eatin with the old man
Tell the truth this rap shit wasnt in the program
Sittin on crates to pickin up weight
You gotta lift open the crate tryin to get my niggas straight
Ridiculous I would even say this on tape Ayo Kiss 
And you say New York City that the world is very different now
Gunlight is my phone real easy to lift it now
Im so appalled
Shoot the pallbearers at your motherfuckin funeral and treat em like dogs
Cause its a motherfuckin war
Nigga DBlock Act like ya know bitch

Aw yeah
Right about now its time to get busy
Huh straight out the box nonstop
Kurupt the Kingpin Xzibit Crooked I
Wait a minute um 
Crooked I
This is the art of manslaughter
When Im rockin Im more shockin than droppin a boom box in bath water
You entered the wrong scuffle
You catchin a chrome buckle
I uppercut niggas hard enough to break my own knuckles
Deliver the sick verbals
My shotty spit a round before you hit the ground
Your body spin around in six circles
Diminishin infamous menaces
Im waitin to get dicced if not Im a start finishin innocents
Lyrics lyrics Im breezin the region
Freezin gs in your legion
Freakin ancient techniques when Im speakin phoenician
Its all about Crooked
These bitches shout Crooked
Ill make you say the West Coast aint shit without Crooked
I own a vicious label niggasll get disabled

I load this 45 and let slugs dive at ya
Now thats for Crooked I the scrap happy mic snatcha

Yall dont wanna see none of this west coast MC shit
Yeah how you like me now motherfucker
Kurupt
Terror starts in the midst of your heart starts
The storm my vocals float like arks
In the mystic state of mind when I create a rhyme
My microphone massacres every year the same time
With audio amputations vocal thoughts of a loud talker
Up against the microphone night stalker
With a tendency of bashing MCs like ten of me
As you can see I continue mashin MCs
Kaboom the room gets cleared as my views get clearer
Extraterrestrial microphone terror
In effect get infected
Tell me what the fucc you expected
These venemous injections
I leave whole sections and sections full of injections
From these poisonous melodies and selections
I select the methods of slow anguish
I mangle shit with my language
Tell me have you ever seen one elope
With the microphone
In a scandal like abilities to make MCs explode
Baboom alone in my own zone
So dont compare me to none
Not ones nearly
Severe cause I severely impare MCs
Near me oppose and fear me I got plots and theories
Sincerely I could have the spot locked
Niggas get stoned for touching microphones
With no knowledge on how to rock
Daz
Yeah back in effect it dont stop
Turn your speakers up DJ Battlecat on the table
We fuckin it up like this and like that yeah
Got my homeboy Xzibit in the motherfuckin house
Alkaholiks
Xzibit
When I was enlisted
I came to the table double fisted
Sadistic heavy artillery for all my enemies
Bust shots up in the sky screamin obsenities
Make niggas sport khakis and chucks from here to Italy
Itll be a cold day in Hell when you see Xzibit fail
Act like a bitch on bail tuck tail and run
See we do it how it cant be done
Im the rough cut plus how the west was won
Or direct descendant of the gatling gun
Dont test me son you fucc around and catch you one
That aint a threat thats a promise I can definitely keep
You cant compete wit 25 niggas wit heat in the street
Ready to repeat round after round at you
All hell break lose when the whole Pound come through
I found that you and yours can never fucc wit mine
I own shit but gimme some more like Busta Rhymes
Cross the line now you gotta pay the piper
Im The Alkaholik sniper that be keepin the crowds hyper

Being you was naive yo I could not let you

And me you know I love the good life
And you I know you hate the hood life

8114,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit It was now midAugust which meant he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months Two months and all he had to show was three dogeared letters and two very expensive longdistance phone calls True when school had ended and shed returned to Wisconsin and he to Locust Pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity She would date occasionally but merely as amusement She would remain faithful
But lately Waldo had begun to worry He had trouble sleeping at night and when he did he had horrible dreams He lay awake at night tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector tears welling in his eyes as he pictured Marsha her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some neanderthal finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion It was more than the human mind could bear
Visions of Marshas faithlessness haunted him Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts And the thing was they wouldnt understand how she really was He Waldo alone understood this He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche He had made her smile She needed him and he wasnt there Awww 
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers Parade was scheduled to appear Hed just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons lawn for a dollar fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America inquiring into his awning needs At least they cared enough to write
It was a New York company You could go anywhere in the mails Then it struck him He didnt have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion true but why not mail himself It was absurdly simple He would ship himself parcel post special delivery The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment He bought masking tape a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build He judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably A few air holes some water perhaps some midnight snacks and it would probably be as good as going tourist
By Friday afternoon Waldo was set He was thoroughly packed and the Post Office had agreed to pick him up at three oclock Hed marked the package Fragile and as he sat curled up inside resting on the foam rubber cushioning hed thoughtfully included he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door saw the package tipped the deliverer and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person She would kiss him and then maybe they could see a movie If hed only thought of this before Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up He landed with a thud in a truck and was off
Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair It had been a very rough weekend She had to remember not to drink like that Bill had been nice about it though After it was over hed said he still respected her and after all it was certainly the way of nature and even though no he didnt love her he did feel an affection for her And after all they were grown adults Oh what Bill could teach Waldo But that seemed many years ago
Sheila Klein her very very best friend walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen Oh gawd its absolutely maudlin outside
Ach I know what you mean I feel all icky
Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table licked her finger and made a face Im supposed to be taking these salt pills but she wrinkled her nose they make me feel like throwing up Marsha started to pat herself under the chin an exercise shed seen on television God dont even talk about that She got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins Want one Supposed to be better than steak and then attempted to touch her knees I dont think Ill ever touch a daiquiri again
She gave up and sat down this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone Maybe Billll call she said to Sheilas glance Sheila nibbled on a cuticle After last night I thought maybe youd be through with him I know what you mean My God he was like an octopus Hands all over the place She gestured raising her arms upwards in defense The thing is after a while you get tired of fighting with him you know and after all I didnt really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him You know what I mean She started to scratch Sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth Ill tell you I felt the same way and even after a while here she bent forward in a whisper I wanted to Now she was laughing very loudly
It was at this point that Mr Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang the doorbell of the large stuccocolored frame house When Marsha Bronson opened the door he helped her carry the package in He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had gotten out of her mothers small beige pocketbook in the den
What do you think it is Sheila asked Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room I dunno
Inside the package Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the muffled voices Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton Why dont you look at the return address and see who its from Waldo felt his heart beating He could feel the vibrating footsteps It would be soon
Marsha walked around the carton and read the inkscratched label Ah god its from Waldo
That schmuck said Sheila Waldo trembled with expectation Well you might as well open it said Sheila Both of them tried to lift the staple flap
Ah sst said Marsha groaning he must have nailed it shut They tugged on the flap again My God you need a power drill to get this thing open They pulled again You cant get a grip They both stood still breathing heavily
Why dont you get a scissor said Sheila Marsha ran into the kitchen but all she could find was a little sewing scissor Then she remembered that her father kept a collection of tools in the basement She ran downstairs and when she came back up she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand This is the best I could find She was very out of breath Here you do it IIm gonna die She sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap but the blade was too big and there wasnt enough room God damn this thing she said feeling very exasperated Then smiling I got an idea
What said Marsha
Just watch said Sheila touching her finger to her head
Inside the package Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe His skin felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart beating in his throat It would be soon Sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package Then she sank down to her knees grasped the cutter by both handles took a deep breath and plunged the long blade through the middle of the package through the masking tape through the cardboard through the cushioning and thud right through the center of Waldo Jeffers head which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun

I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall
A man can tell a thousand lies

7165,"Do you know what youre goin through
Do you like this style of rap that Im showin you
The way I flow for you do you know
Yeah baby cmon
Ah baby baby cmon check the rhyme to the song
Uhh aw yeah baby cmon
Ah baby baby cmon and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four gotta keep em on the floor
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What Im used to hearin I cant believe its gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King the beef is on
When I come rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices weak in the knees
So run for your lives Kane with the pen
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills come see how it feels
I pull you one verse if that dont kill I got refills
You cant do me none kid you gets nothin
If my rhymes was in Braille you still couldnt touch em
Man Im a bad cat my style of rap is mad fat
And you know sometimes its so sad that
Rappers today be comin as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft they wouldnt even kill time right
Heres the news you lettin the word hardcore be misused
You aint never paid dues
Be for real you aint tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmn sham
Im glad in this business I didnt forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
Never to walk in anyones shadow
I do my own thing I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
That battles I dont lose none boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die choose one
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin sex the way that I put it in em
And do I crush MCs are you kiddin me
If rappers were grapes Id have a whole wine distillery
So I bring it to your face with the bass then I blow
A rapper off the map with the rap when I flow
Then hit you with the skill that is ill and I know
That all of this is good to go cause yo
Thats the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum
The Brooklyn style cause that is where Im from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track just like that
Amazin the people the style of the rappin is quite fat
Im lickin the lyrics and shootin the gat on the mic black
And this is for all of the rappers that like and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan
Cause all the ladies Im givin em lots of love
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick even the slimmy ones
Watch out Goldie Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
And none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
With skills to pay the bills to make more stacks than
Taller than anybody elses stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers dont believe the magazine rumors
Cause Kane is makin a comeback like Pumas
I get rough G and set it on your whole damn company
And Bogart like my name was Humphrey
When I get through therell be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt I should open a crematorium
I make mad MCs give me my Ps
If you try to disrespect kid you can get these
NUTs like the UNVs
I leave you down on your knees down on your kneehees
Razor sharp many ways of art
Source rings the chart people praise the God
For kickin the flows so fantastic and this one here
Were callin it Lyrical Gymnastics

7930,"Real Niggaz New Version Lyrics a different version than all previous releases
Every motherfucker always asks how did NWA get started
We dont know how it got started
Fuck that question you know what Im saying
Its the same bullshit over and over
How did we get started
How did we first meet
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo you shouldve covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you was a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker
Dont try to hang you best avoid it
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemrroids
Before you try to fuck with Ren
Ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting the size 10
First come first serve whoevers got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the world of the motherfucking HipHop maniac
Brainiac so what you ought to do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think your rap would last
With your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo be original your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you motherfucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums for many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles
Cheating and not beating the crowd are kept seating
But weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
And got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo giving what I gotta give doing what I gotta do
You dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
You cant harm me alarm me
Cause were the generals in this fucking HipHop army
The niggas with attitudes if you didnt know
We blow flow and then move slow from the get Go
Yo tie us to take it
Yo fuck this shit Yella kick the break in
Its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
You can run but you cant hide you know Im a find you
Cause a nigga like Ren is only two steps behind you
Dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep with the lights on forget that the Mics on
Dont step on my motherfucking stage without Nikes on
Dont say its psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
All these niggas with the gibber gabber
But couldnt kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer
Gangsters in black are out there
But only because yo its the shit that we wear
On my motherfucking dick
But Ima love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
So yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
Youll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead
Black the good the bad the ugly you see
A little street wise nigga you know me
Rolling with some real niggas playing for keeps
But you motherfuckers know who run the streets
With that hardcore HipHop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get
Trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
Since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
Cause Im the motherfucker thats out to kill
EazyE a nigga thats real
Timed bomb count down 
Real niggas straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without a second thought
And if your ass get smoked its my bullet you caught
So if youre talking shit about the niggas in black Explosion 
Bow down to the Kings and Raider hats
They played out thats what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we aint happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
Yet so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes Ill come like a fucking bump
Asking for fucking money dont buy you a fucking crumb
Youre on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
Because if I let you slide its just cause you lucked up
Dont come in my face again because Im a floor you
And if youre a bitch Ima fucking ignore you
Because my attitude is a little bigger
Cause MC Ren is one of the Real Niggas
Lost in a motherfucking world of madness
Sadness but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucking motherfuckers like you making whack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When Im expressing standstill like youre full of Rigor Mortis
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess you figure
You can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
A nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out with too much cargo
So Im glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo NWA criticized for what we say
But Ima do the shit anyway
Cause Im the motherfucking doctor never faking
Yo Yella kick the motherfucking break in
Its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
Yeah motherfucker its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
NWA Straight Outta motherfucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990s

The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you cant smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets
Theyre all uptight uptight
Uptight uptight
Uptight uptight
I wish that theyd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when Im driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as Id love to see it
Id tell all my friends but theyd never believe me
Theyd think that Id finally lost it completely
Id show them the stars and the meaning of life
Theyd shut me away
But Id be alright alright
Mom Im alright alright
Im just uptight uptight

Street life scarred me my soul need therapy Therapy

I aint never been the one to complain thats win or lose
Made moves and paid dues walk in my shoes
Its like a nigga came with directions I really made me
I was drownin then I threw me a float I really saved me
Put down everything that I love thats on my legacy
Never fucked over nobody to make a better me
If you ask me what happened with Kink we grew apart
Tried to sue he took me to court shit broke my heart
Same nigga you made a millionaire sue you for millions
Made man and he want it all none for my children
If 15 wasnt my dawg I wouldve touched them
When that shit went down with Gibbs I couldnt trust him
Invested my hard earned money tied up my bread
But he gon try to tell you Im flawed thats in his head
Its happening just the way that I said it good on your own
And if Im honest nothin gangsta about you leave this alone yeah
And everybody wonderin what happened with me and Coach
Same shit that happened between Tommy and Ghost
Cause yeah the checks comin in but the trust aint there
I would say its all him but that wouldnt be fair
I was fresh up out the streets tryna fight my own demons
Knew somethin wasnt right guess I had my own reasons
Mission impossible I aint underplan that
Shake took his own life I aint understand that
Had me feelin numb laid in bed for a week
Eyes didnt close one time thats a week with no sleep
Ima keep it solid he the reason me and Ross talk
Never ashamed to admit that I was wrong yeah thats boss talk
Since we talkin boss talk lets address the sucka shit
Grown man playin on Instagram real sucka shit
Why the fuck this clown nigga playin with my legacy
Solid in these streets thats some shit that you will never be
Talking bout power but weak niggas do the most
In real life nigga you really borrow money from Ghost
All that lil boy shit yeah it make it evident
Made millions in these streets what the fuck is 50 Cent
And its still free Meech love him if he right or wrong
But the streets wanna know do we really get along
If you askin me nigga thats one thousand percent
If I did somethin wrong then I gotta repent
Aint no hatred in my heart aint no hatred in my veins
If you felt me being distant think its time to explain
I was stickin to my plan while Raf Simons took the stand
He tried to GMoney me whats happenin with your man
Tried to throw me in your case guess he tryna save face
No exception know the rules I just handled it with grace
And I aint sayin that you told him to do it I know better
Still the same nigga nothin but love thats forever
See my ego and my pride yeah I put it all aside
Reminiscing bout all them late nights we used to vibe
When its all said and done were brothers your mother love us
The Feds did you dirty cant stand them motherfuckers
Speaking bout brothers welcome home Tee
A nigga might owe you money but that nigga aint me

I hate to see Shady respond to shit he shouldnt respond to

We black we are our own barbers

5437,"There are too many MCs who are overrated
You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
In the rap biz they dont know what rap is
So give it up become a actor or a actress
Or a producer cause you fail to use the
Mic right so take flight fore I bruise ya
For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract
Ayo Im serious Big L aint playin games
I should get foul and buckwild and start sayin names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve
Goin platinum and dont have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold
I dont like the way its goin down
Because it should be the other way around
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
MCs whats goin on
I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
One minute youre hardcore and raw
Thats what you was known for but not no more
You changed you rearranged youre not the same
Your raps are plain that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop now you no longer gain props
Whose fault is that Nobodys but your own black
Used to make phat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
So MCs dont ever step out your range
Remain the same and only change with the time
Or else youll get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like Im goin for mine
But if youre rough stay rough
If youre dap stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
How MCs take this rap game for granted
This is how it should be done
Im not the one and my raps are strong like rum
But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb plus slum
How come Rap skills they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail and false like fairy tales
Your technique and everythin you speaks weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
Step to this and get ran over like a train track
Your raps are poor to wack and you went on tour with that crap
Dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares
Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they dont write theirs
But still call themselves MCs
Please how could that be
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it 
I dont understand it I dont understand it

Welcome back
Existing on damnations edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown
Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord
The gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
Theres no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul cannot be saved
Crucify your socalled Lord
He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
Hell awaits
The reaper guards the darkened gates
That Satan calls his home
The demons feed the furnace where
The dead are free to roam
Lonely children of the night
Theres seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
That Lucifer controls
Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you
Satanic law prevails your life is through
Pray to the moon when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
For what you seek for cant be found
In sea or sky or underground
Now I have you deep inside
My everlasting grasp
The seven bloody gates of Hell
Is where youll live your last
Warriors from Hells domain
Will bring you to your death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest
The gates of Hell lie waiting as you see
Theres no price to pay just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul cannot be saved
Sacrifice the lives of all
I know they soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell
And keep the fires growing deep inside
Hell awaits

All for one one for all
This is motherfucking beautiful
Talk to em baby
This for the cold Ds that wont snitch
For the murderers that wont miss
For the hustlers thatll front bricks
For the hoodrats that want chips
For the stickup kids creepin with they Pumps ripped
For lil shorty with his rhyme books
Black girls going to school carrying like 9 books
For the hood niggas
That go to work because parole but they tryin to be good niggas
For all the poor mothers
Thats always goin through the struggle still screamin that the Lord Love us
For the ghetto life
For having to hold your metal tight lookin for a better life
For the family
For if Im rich you rich and that shits a guarantee
For the best of life
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life
We thugs my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto my niggas
Any time any place we dont give a fuck we bust metal my niggas
We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
Watch what you sayin cause we shank you my niggas
We DBlock niggas we dont play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas
Aiyyo yo Imma shed blood for mine thats one ritual
Thats how you keep the love unconditional
Thats why we the only one the thugs listen to
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do
I know a few dudes doin life bids in jail
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale
But that how life is
And that how the gun and the knife is
Its a shame but its real when your enemies like ya
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper
Listen it aint the rappers its the rats that worry me
Double R for life DBlock til they bury me
Scared niggas shed off
Or stand way in the back and aim they gat up in the air and
Let off
Thorough niggas tear nigga head off then let the blood keep drippin
And just wipe the sweat off
Fuck with P the thugll come out
The slugll come out
You dont put in enough work I got chu
No doubt
They dont want Sheek to wild
Betta cover ya child
With two guns out the sunroof
Swordfish style
Who that kid
Black mask on with the latch on the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag
You get it in a hurry
All up in your Burberry
Through your assisstant
Through your fucking secretary
All yall do me a favor
Walk with me
If you want money or drugs
Talk with me
Know I got my niggas my guns
Now hawk with me
Guess who Jada P and The Sheek
Three bricks
Three whips
Three motherfucking ouies a week
Ten spots OT
Two blew off leak
My niggas cop
Pop and toss and we applying the pressure
So when you address us
Its Boss

I can relate to what youre sayin in your songs
So when I have a shitty day I drift away and put em on
Cause I dont really got shit else
So that shit helps when Im depressed

I got a college girl who go to church ery Sunday
Had her sneak out of choir rehearsal to put it on me
But shes so innocent when she ridin mami
One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin laundry
Favorite chore of mine its my lil bunny
Bowlegged and classy such a real woman
Sex all night go to work ery mornin
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her Me too mami
When you get off work daddy gon punish
You my nasty girl forever I promise
I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me Come home soon
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta
All white coat all white heels
And nothin underneath so its an all night deal
Im her number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her vitamin D
But wait I got a lawyer girl thats so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
Said she needs some evidence and to show her the PROOF
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause Im hung like a jury jury 
Judge Luda preside over your body and Im never in a hurry

Every time you see her shes with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah thats the reason why

Beautiful Delilah dressed in the latest style
Swinging like a pendulum walking down the aisle
Deep romantic eyes speak so low in miles
Maybe she will settle down and marry after a while

Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now hes taken your freedom for a taste unknown

Its true I guess I mean wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ignant Really Really
Church bells and choir sounds tell em Quiet down
Bow your head the Most Highs around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me ties and gowns happen now
My entire sound is how you tryna sound Stop it now
They ask me why I dont go to church no more
Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs my sister the next stripper
My brother the next victim my usher the next tricker
Satan givin out deals finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first then your homies after
Lets show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters

To own the Rollie Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared face your fears all you niggas scared
Say your prayers pray you fit upstairs its our only hope

The ushers keep skimmin the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers

Youre gonna go insane

All right

They dont know what I hide

7642,"Hey yo remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfucker said it wasnt gonna work
That crazy shit
Yeah the stupid shit man
That shit was dope
Hey yo Eazy
Wassup
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute and bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was Gangsta Gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there coldshootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo man
Get the fuck out
Pump that beat
Mothafucka say what
Donald Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12gauge
One sucker dead LA Times front page
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo Leroy
Beer drinkin breath stinkin sniffin glue
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappyass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Who do you think you are Mr Big Stuff
Rock mothafucka like the hard three the hard way
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the sixfo round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
Ill throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
LA playa
Big Drum beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out Fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yeah I kicked a little ass
But that was a blast from the past mothafucka

5572,"I mean Sometimes I see things I guess cause Im a ghost I see ghostly things
Thought I saw something that wasnt there but it was there
Theyre as far as the eye can see
as far as I can see though 
There are shadows haunting me
I see shadows 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
and Im looking real far even if Im asleep 
There are shadows haunting me
aint that something 
Something in the shadows
Maybe its the Pharaohs
Coming to spread the light cause the visions so narrow
Maybe its the killas in the cut with the barrels
Getting high but cant fly without the eye of a sparrow
Fatigued and fatigue ready for battle
My word could move herd like the cattle
Try to stay hard lifes fragile meaning you could lose any moment
My cranium is like Damiens no Omen
I dont bare the mark of the beast
Just the heart of the beast
Rally for em when its dark in the streets
Just a ice cold nigga that be sparking the heat
Tryna make it through the struggle just to say at the least
If they coming tell em come now
Sunset sundown
I dont put my gun down
And I aint tryna run clown
I keep something in the barrels
Fully loaded up knowing theres something in the shadows
Theyre as far as the eye can see
Point blank period get high and hallucinate 
There are shadows haunting me
Stress is building up 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
I smell murder every time that the wind blows 
There are shadows haunting me
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling 
Something in the shadows maybe its the reaper
Maybe its the devil trying to put me in the sleeper
Maybe its God trying to tell me that Im deeper
Ill know soon have faith in a goon
I broke date mad years trying to race with the moon
If the sun give me energy
Why I pull my gun on my enemies
And wait for nightfall to drink Hennessy
Cups of Courvoisier times the same on this Swatch
Or Cartier unless you set your watch different
We got eyes but our watch different
Be on the block different
Be on the low in the spot different
I got bars but the Glock kicking
Im in tune with the moon
And the wolves that howl at it
You could play the game if you foul at it
Tell the pigs its a fair game
I get high and kick my Nike Airs off in first class on the airplane
I wont rest til the day I see the angel of death
And tell him wish me the best
If I dont get it this life may I get it the next
Never settle for less
Street niggas say I did it the best which is true though
Coke since the days of Menudo
Higher than Pluto
Something in the shadows but I aint got a clue though I got no clue 
Im getting drunk off the booze
Im getting high just recording with Poose
Have dreams about the Lord and his crew
Or the devil and his boys
I have voices in my head but I can never make the noise stop cant stop can it 
They always singing on a carol
Far as they can see know theres something in the shadows

7967,"Say this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred
CL Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met we wasnt on the same page
From petty misunderstandings that got clearer with age
Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put PA on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Bigtyme put down a few songs
Everybody cosigned saying that we could do no wrong
Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped Tell Me Something Good took off and went live
Shit next thing you know we was signing to Jive
Dropped Too Hard to Swallow A Pocket Full of Stones
Put the remix on Menace shit we had it going on
Got love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out wasnt playing too fair
Had to separate ourself bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side aint always what it seems
We dropped Super Tight a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes
We didnt realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice
Took a while to catch on to what homey was doing
But by the time we did all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldnt file taxes
The next thing you know IRS hitting us with axes
Pimp you owe seven figures Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM almost got put on the shelf
Fuck it dropped Ridin Dirty instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title shut everybodys mouth
Got some clout in the game boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters
The old manager calling and say he fina sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets and we cant keep the people waiting
He made a call or two to some folks tellin em man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan Bun got the drawl
RapALot had our back and we just waiting on Jive
We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the NY
Its JayZ saying yall niggas getting fly
He doing Volume 3 and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggas rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it but Pimp wasnt sure
But Big Pimpin hit em 187Pure
Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated cant believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded
And it stated that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and well be on the way
Shit it sounded okay but me I had to ask
If we dont do Big Pimpin 2 would you still put us on blast
A song like that would might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base might think a nigga flop
They got mad and put niggas on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix
We put Dirty Money together and it was aces
But thats around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation said fuck you hoes
We finish the album got ready to do a couple shows
And then he violated one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done we back to the nitty gritty
Album got released big showdown in Chocolate City
Niggas with masks on vests and all black
Its Christmas 2001 bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block nobody could budge
And then he violated now we right back before the judge
They calling him a nuisance put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th he aint been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
In stead of coCEO now Im the fuckin boss
Had the devil on my back got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please
Let me get past this bridge over water thats trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son dont worry
Cause its not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams
You just got to stay true to yourself and to C
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before Im breaking em G
Not to mention I got the world screaming Free Pimp C
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You aint gotta worry about nothing the world is yours
Aint no mo struggles my nigga and no mo strife
I kept it real because to me its UGK for life

7529,"Awww yeah
Uh Uhhuh 
Uh Uhhuh 
Uh Uhhuh 
One two
Microphone checka one two
Microphone checka one two
Microphone checka one two
Tell em what Im gonna do
On and on and on is how the beat goes
So sell the British Walkers and cut the afros
And dance til the feeling is gone in your toes
I wear shorts in the summer Timberlands when it snows
Sometimes I like to chill sometimes I like to mingle
Sometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single
Sexy young slimmy but not too young though
Thats because Jimmy might end up on death row
Now this here jam is like a special kind of song
Its not too short but then again its not too long
I brought somebody with me someone you might know
Hes bound to wreck your body from the tip of your toe
All the way up to your last hair follicle
Hey hey hey its me the diabolical
Yes yall and its time for me to fall in
To a funky beat to make you have a ball and like
Jump make you move your rump on the floor and like pump
Cmon dont be a chump I see four and maybe five
Live party people but the rest did not survive
Why 
They had a cardiac arrest
Now rocking microphones is something I do daily and
Making people dance like if I was Alvin Ailey and
People just love it when the Biz starts to play
With my and by the way
Skeezing with a girl is something I get tricky
And Im the sneaky type to like slip a girl a mickey
And I live the type of life thats far from affordable
Standing on the corner calling cuties on the portable
Me and master ace is funky word to miz 
Yo who is it Ace its me and the Biz 
Its me and the Biz repeat 4x 
Yo Ace I got an um question
Excuse me brother but can you spare a dime
Naw but if you want I can kick a funky rhyme
All I need is a groove thats as smooth like a harp and
Im ready to talk nough shit like Al Sharpton
I take the stage and engage in a page and
My name is Master Ace and 22 is the age
Yo Im the BIZM and like a lot of women
Bought a new car because the first one was a lemon
Gucci Louis Fendi Me and sexy Cindy
Riding around the block as if I was in the Indy
Everybody pointing cause I am the joint and
They know its me because Im the BIZ
Sometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life
Should I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife
And get a regular job where Im working 9 to 5
Shit Im the Biz and its great to be alive
Im making crazy hits a winner never quits
So those that used to diss me in the past are having fits
But I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table
Cause Im able to rock a crowd without a cable
Or a Cuban link and yo Lincoln wasnt Cuban 
So I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin
MASTER and this aint store bought hiphop from a jar and
It sure aint Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the wiz 
Its me and the Biz
Im a 100 proof and rag on the roof and
Pulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth and
Wilding styling this land is my land
youre a prisoner to my music like you was on Rikers Island
A slim softspoken brother from the ghetto
My name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know
You run your rhymes like a horse and force and
Extra booty lyrics on the crowd like youre the boss and
I think youd better keep them to yourself
Do it for yourself put your lyrics back up on the shelf
Now Im going to pass it to the BIZ MARKIE
Cause I know you want to see him
Ah one two one two this is what Im gonna do
Keep the place jumping get it wild like a zoo
If anyone can do it the BIZ can
Peace to Marley Marl Tragedy and MC Shan
And my cousin Cool V and TJ Swan E and
The Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and

2839,"Hey life look at me
I can see the reality
Cause when you shook me took me out of my world
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
Cause when you got a tender love
You dont take care of
Then you better beware of the happening
One day youre up then you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you
I was sure I felt secure
Until love took a detour
Yeah riding high on top of the world
It happened suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams fall apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need
To guide you
Something happens inside you the happening
Now I see life for what it is
Its not all dreams ooh its not all bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you
Once
Ooh and then it happened
Ooh and then it happened
Ooh and then it happened
Ooh and then it happened
Is it real is it fake
Is this game of life a mistake
Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain suddenly I started hurting
I saw the light too late
When that fickle finger of fate
Yeah came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
So sure I felt secure
Until love took a detour
Cause when you got a tender love you dont
Take care of then you better beware of
",inside you the happening Now I see life for what it is Its not all dreams ooh its not all bliss It happened to me and it can happen to you Once Ooh and then it happened Ooh and then it happened Ooh and then it happened Ooh and then it happened Is it real is it fake Is this game of life a mistake Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine For certain suddenly I started hurting I saw the light too late When that fickle finger of fate Yeah came and broke my pretty balloon I woke up Suddenly I just woke up to the happening So sure I felt secure Until love took a detour Cause when you got a tender love you dont Take care of then you better beware of,Hey life look at me I can see the reality Cause when you shook me took me out of my world I woke up Suddenly I just woke up to the happening When you find that you left the future behind Cause when you got a tender love You dont take care of Then you better beware of the happening One day youre up then you turn around You find your world is tumbling down It happened to me and it can happen to you I was sure I felt secure Until love took a detour Yeah riding high on top of the world It happened suddenly it just happened I saw my dreams fall apart When love walked away from my heart And when you lose that precious love you need To guide you Something happens

We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured Someday soon
We kissed and clung together

Recalling thrills of our love
Theres one thing Im certain of
Return I will to old Brazil

Shame on you hater this what the Lord sent me
Shit lately Ive been practicing my gas face
Cause thats what Ima give em when they land in last place
Hand right by the hammer aint too many seein Santa
So they wanna take my gifts but I wrap em with the fif
My regular scent is piff currency and Cashmere
You done drove your bitch away I told her she can crash here
Yeah Im counting paper like the cashier
Living like Im limited breathing like its my last air
My boy in and out the box super stupid soldier
Told me if he could do it again hed do it over
Povertys king cobra squeeze your life out
Cause its the fatalities and causalities I should write bout
These rappers aint iced out they just fooling niggas
Running round town fakers zirconian cubic niggas
Only money matters in the game fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs feed my hunger pain
Music like heroin leave you numb the same
Play me like Im something sweet be apart of summer slaying
Most hate it most doubt it thats what they shouted
Im on top now theres nothing they can do about it
Yall better have yall guns
Cause walking where Im from there aint no way around it
Home sweet home
You motherfuckers can rap til you blue in the face
Youll probably turn into smurfs with the time that you waste
Throughout history they thrown shots at the greats
But I shoot back the Lord aint designed me for hate
Ive never understood Martin Luther with the speech
With the whole world watching me turn the other cheek
Never so theres one left to die in the streets
Cause his long arms happen to connect with his reach
Try to kill you then them near misses was Gods kisses

Then when you get the money you get the power
Then when you get the power Then you get the woman
The problem is you broke You aint got no car or job
You slow with your hustle You dress like a slob
Ladies aint looking for no brothers like this
They want the dubtwisting ballers with the ice on their wrist
You gotta get your cash right to get in the game
Might have to pull a pistol Flip some caine
Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain
Take your come up and reinvest to the game
You gotta make the money first
You need a lot to go far
What you think is rich I just spent on a car
What you think is paid I just blew on a watch
What you think is wealthy I just dropped on a yacht
Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks
Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops
But it really aint that easy Or we all would be rich
One mistake Youre broke The come ups a bitch
Make the right moves and forget about sleep
Concentrate on the paper chase Join the elite
Few dun got mad cash and money to spend
Money to straight blow and money to lend
And only then You made it past stage one My friend
Now you got the money and the cash flow thick
But you really aint nothing but a richer trick
Just because youre paid you can still get thick
By your low life homies or skanless bitch
You gotta move it around put it in the right hands
Maybe a judge Make a PA your friend
Understand what really moves the world
Recognize what really moves these girls
Juice is more important than cash for real
Money you spend But true power you feel
It aint that easy to reach
Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get
Make your moves correct Watch your crew
Watch your back They watching you
Anybody round you has gotta be true
Or you never make it past stage two
Listen when you get the real true power You know
People will feel you Wherever you go
And when you really max this game
Youll never have to say your name
Now you got the power Its on My friend
Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men
The one thing women hate are brothers that bend
They act like they like em But they only pretend
They wanna be with that man in the VI
They dont wanna stand in line
You outta your mind
That other players got cash But no juice
Cuz the powerful men get to choose
From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews
Willing to do much more than before
Give you quick brains Its insane
Just what the womanll do just for you
Cuz if you got the power Then they gets it too
If you rollin benz Then they rollin too
If you livin phat Then they ballin too

Searching outside of themselves

And so I face the final curtain
My friend Ill say it clear
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
I traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times Im sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
Ive loved Ive laughed and cried
Ive had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way
For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes it was my way

Will it just be me and you

Because my ride is awaiting our date and
Of steak and a night cap
We mating awaking
By smells of perfume that I inhale
And then tell how well we raise hell on the dizzell
Satin sheets
Heat from your feet keep me warm
The mood is perfected by sounds from the storm
You came stronger I lasted longer
Than Ive ever lasted your mouth was fantastic
The fuck test you passed it
The way you made a nigga laugh I had to getcha
And when I saw that ass pass I had to hit cha
Ya making me fight against my will what must I do
Would ya kill for me ya if my life in danger too
Even steal for me ya if that shit belongs to you
Then feel for me ya if the way you act is true
Who knows fine clothes
Lexus doors youll be closing when you become one of the chosen
Hoes in different places different faces
Different cases got me tied like shoe laces
No mistake this MJG you aint gotta be
Constantly trying to shoot that P claiming that you aint heard of me
Keeping it real let me know how you feel when we communicate

Instead of preferring her weight some who cant do it
Lose women but nigga like me used to it

Rappers get dat ass then be outta here like yesterday
But not tonight you look so tight
It feels so right this indo got me perving
Lets go hop in my Suburban
And ride til we get to where you want to be no matter how far
Just call me Oball baby to me youre the superstar
Ask me time and time again why did I choose you
Do I wanna be your man or just misuse you
I hear your partners dissing
When they think I aint listening
Them hoes just be wishing
They could be in yo position
With me in luxury
I got to be everyday
Chiefin hay with something stout wearing lingerie
Lets hit the tel
Get a suite
An order something to eat
Tell me things about you
Ill tell you things about me
Then out the blue Ill be carressing you undressing you
You start doing all shit you said youd never do
Lustin busting all out of my boxer drawers
Fingers dripping slipping in an out in an out
Constantly telling me the things you dont do

Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
Hes comin home with his neck scratched to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched
On his breaths Jack hes a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
Its a chess match shes on his back like a jetpack
Shes kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin on to the next
Actually just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
Cause she loves danger psychopath
And you dont fuck with no mans girl even I know that
But shes devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand says their relationships hangin by a strand
So shes been on the web lately
Says maybe shell be my Gwen Stacy to spite her man
And I know shes using me to try to play him I dont care
Hi Suzanne but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night but tonight I am
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
A onenight stand turned a twonight stand
It was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and
He found out now she feels deserted and used
Cause he left so what He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that were through
Its hard to find the words Im aloof nervous and Sue
Dont want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Dont take it personal I just cant say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like holeinthewall diners
Dont have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who Im turning intos
Irreversible I preyed on you like its church at the pew
And now that I got you I dont want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do
Get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin the wound
Cause now with her in the womb
We cant bring her in this world shoulda knew
To use protection fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me

So let the river run
My names Ooh my names Ooh 
River Ooh river run
Call me Ooh call me Ooh 
River Ooh well let the river run
Always the bridesmaid never The bride hey
Fuck can I say If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave Id be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate like Im slidin on ice maybe
Thats why I may have came at you sideways
I cant keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
What else can I say It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didnt really wanna abort but fuck it
Whats one more lie to tell our unborn child
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me

The corners crowded niggas must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And Imma gamble until he come back why not
Clickclack cock the gat back gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed mad cats pockets was fat
They playin ceelo my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
After headcrack got my bread back jumped in my red Ac
Im waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas startin to plot and Im far from my block
Finally he walked out told him Hop the fuck in
On my face he saw the grin and said How much did you win
I estimated about 45 maybe 50 Gs
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey Ds
Now Im alone headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones I said Yo son Im on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs bring your big gun
I dont believe this this nigga said he cant make it
Cause some bitch is in his house buttnaked
And then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he dont give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut what
Im cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from and his grimy crimey
Its about to get real hasty
Grabbed the steel took it off safety
Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast then stopped short and made em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too leakin with a deep gash
I aint panicked I was quite calm
Couldnt use the right arm so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him shook my head then started buckin my heat
Its over now cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think Im dyin Im feelin weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help I had to catch a cab first
To onefortyfirst and Bradhurst
Thats where Bones live walked in the buildin staggerin
Lookin tore down shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye he knew he would die
Started to cry stuck the gat to his head and said Why
Then he offered me all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out hes assout then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood about to pass out
The hospitals up a couple of blocks Im on my way but
Damn here comes a couple of cops I pulled out
And started blowin they started blowin back Im goin all out
I aint holdin back I been to jail once and I aint goin back
I kept shootin one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad and couldnt stop it
But still had the fifty thou profit in my pockets
The coast was clear so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them run for they share
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens that means here comes the Jakes
But its too late Im knockin on the pearly gates
Yeah casualties of a dice game
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya
Yeah its Corleone yall
Yeah its Flamboyant yall
Big L yall Flamboyant baby yeah
Big L uhh

That shit movin
Yes it is
Yeah
Long time comin out the gate Had the golden key 
Whole squad waited for a plate Now its time to eat 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em Go to war with em 
Stay on your shit you gon bubble up Bubble up 
When you on lit you gon double up Double up 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga Fall nigga 
Extra clips when we go to war with em Go to war with em 
Stay on your shit and you gon bubble up
We was all poor but we squad so we huddled up
If it aint a bullet or the law it dont trouble us
High doin dirt but Im hopin the Lord cover us
Uptown doin it downtown doin it out of state pursuin it
A cop or a shot from a Glock might ruin it
All I think about is who I drink this King Louis with
My niggas my main squeeze from the jungle
But it seems that money contain Gs
Told the plug make the call whenever the plane leaves
Feel joy from the money whenever the pain leaves
But the pain never goes
Moneys the root of evil am I sane for the flow Insane for the flow

Long time comin out the gate Had the golden key 
Whole squad waited for a plate Now its time to eat 
Heard them haters prayin that we fall nigga Fall nigga

Extra clips when we go to war with em Go to war with em 
When you on lit you gon double up
Louis everything two of everything cuddled up
Got the work blew up everything now they fuck wit us
Long climb but it seem fast like we shuttled up
Tuna in a can to that lobster buttered up
Now I eat plants and I plan to plant some
Plannin to stamp somethin and niggas cant fuck it up
Cause we aint golden until we all shine
Can my Ghost live longer than one lifetime
Four left turns Im in my right mind
Flyin to Tiffanys from kickin epiphanies
While I was hittin trees and thinkin of victories
Turned a nick to a dime and bought me a nick of weed
Made me a little rhyme planted a little seed
Tomorrows ghost night today is ghost eve
So I told my ghost Go flow proceed
Long time comin out the gate Had the golden key 
Whole squad waited for a plate Now its time to eat

If I had to swear to God Id give it all to em
Know the feelin my nigga Ive been poor with em
But they cant walk on me Im not a floor for em
Only God knows what He has in store for em
Lord doeth as He shall and thats all for em

Cause you wanna hear about shit like this
So I tell it how I know it just hope the fuck I dont show it
Niggas out frontin loitering and looting
Lets recreate a driveby shooting
More brothers in a car blocks away
Waiting to spray shotgun Mack10 and an AK
They roll through to a line of niggas
It was 9 just like the fuck they figured
Go around the corner come back real slow
Lights off cars in neutral rollin at a snails pace and creepin
Hoping to catch all of them sleepin
A socalled gang drugs and sex NWA 
Start busting a cap and all the others jet 3 of em fall to their doom
Pronounced dead at the scene with gunshot wounds
3 dead because Compton is scandalous
Id like to tell you brother ashes to ashes dust to dust Amen

Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

My minds distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when youre asleep
And kiss you when you start your day
And a song I was writing is left undone
I dont know why I spend my time
Writing songs I cant believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme
And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you
And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain

7014,"Id like to introduce myself
Its me the diabolical Biz Mark symbolical
I shakes from scripts of hits I made a while ago
Now Im on the run again starting other capers
And people couldnt catch me even if I was The Vapors
I leave you in trauma with my funky personna
Cause Im jamming just like Teddy but Im nasty like Madonna
Cause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song
Is like Patty LaBelle not singing with a wig on
I dont give a damn if my record gets panned
Cause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran
When Im sure that Im pure like Snapple
Suppose when I write my rhymes like Im the Big Apple
Or New York or whatever you call it I dont even care
Cause if I can make it there I can make it anywhere
So I walk the walk through the streets of New York
Got more green I can hawk cause I can talk the talk
So dont try to stalk cause my style brings more
I rock it from the Billy Ocean to the Al B Shore
People always want to give dap to everyone
But Ive been around the world so I ahhh 
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet
Take a pause for the cause cause this is a recording
If rap was a prison then I be the warden
I do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordans
And when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon
You want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave
And I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave
And when I drop a style call it def call it cool
As long as you dont call me when Im on a toilet stool
I stoke and swin in a room full of women
When I trot the globe like Meadowlark Lemon
Everywhere Ive been Ive seen em fat and thin
Even girls with hair on their chinny chin chin
But you can be just a friend if youre sporting your own look
Or if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook
Women love my style from Cali to Long Isle
Even got my mother singing Thanks for my Child
My temperature rises every time Im near a stereo
Cause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio
But I go on and on and on and on and on and
From midnight point to the early morning AHHHH
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet  Repeat 4x 
Its my way or the highway Im ahead of the slow lane
But when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train
Rappers like to flow with all energy and action
But Id rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson
So dont try to stick to me like somebodys gearshift
Cause Ill hit you so far west youll come back Easter
The style I display but I say it a badder way
I got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday
Youre still confused cause you dont know how bad he is
Like a pregnant who dont know who the daddy is
Just like a snap I can whip any rapper
Thats why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper
Youre lost in the sofa trying to cross my line
Then run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind
Im coming on strong cause Im dropping nothing soft
Still had it going on when The Biz is Going Off
Im singing in the rain cause I got the audacity
Or some kids want to sundance with Butch Cassidy
You couldnt shine on my in the spotlight
Cause your ass couldnt shine if you sat on a flashlight
Im the Biz Markie the human beatbox and the rap king
Have the people stomping to my beat you bet  Repeat 4x

I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free
Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And Ill play if you have the money
Or if youre a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good for free
Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on their TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good for free

Places to park by the factories and buildings

And I have learned how these things work together
I see the parkway that passes through them all

I wouldnt live there if you paid me
I wouldnt live like that no sirree
I wouldnt do the things the way those people do

5320,"No originality take a ride with the natural
I aint blow up yet
Fear the greatest bomb in the Apple
Tackles broke to pieces
The streets are scorching trying to over ease ya
A firm believer I wore the crown on my Caesar
Freezer count me up
This test an alley thump just made the tally jump
Wild around me catch a smiley cut let out the alley up
Writers block cant get my mind to stop
Most days I island hop
Karmas a bitch I found a spot
Wandering trips around the clock
Charming your chick from down the block
Flow got her she found a shark
My fins showin two tens throwing a pound a spark
Uh So many washing up Im edged in stone though
You fool pit browse
My testers slam the lomo exit solo
Big tests for soso need us extra promo
No runner ups can catch the pros
So slice the pie like Lexus logo
Bet my cadence alarms impostors
Problems just hanging strange fruit
Hs and orange boxes
Big faces in all the watches
Roses Aces and Knockers
Hoes embrace their show stoppers
Hundred papers more options
With hunger pain theres no nonsense
Rumble game Im all offense
Launching confidence here
And I know these powers wont feel me
Theyll be over your shit in no time
And no you aint getting no cosign
Im fully equipped to go
Im in solid gold at the goal line
Powder rope through my smoke climb higher
Cant pick my code ma
Over matter fact whos badder
Aint no rapper here or after
Back in my zone at night
These new niggas is over hyped
Steep look into a soldiers life
Three or four minutes of poltergeist
Sweet beginningsIm ultra nice
Come kill a God he multiples
Open eyes hit critics
Visits from broken wives
Through the impossible
The fuck is you doing with oxygen
These bums done brung up my name in vein
Wondering when you hit your compliments
My conscience vents
Henny and mobster tints
Hell out the audience
Stand up guy bet he wont hop a fence
If any a consequence
Stepped in good been stomping since
Different kind maybe common sense
Calm me down with the capital
Built the crown and no avenue
Boring niggas will challenge you
Slaughtering since 2002
Porno vids in my memory
Foreign trips out to Kennedy
Hoing tricks out for energy
Told a bitch I wouldnt let it be
Every week with another head
Chcheck out my symmetry
My maniac rhyme
More amazing than all your favorites combined
Im killing ya maaan
Hit the fire on these bitches one time
I sunshine I cook the area
Burn up your front line
Turn up my new shit product of DJ Dram
Sour out the nose and bottle cliques
Urban model chicks
Lifes a room a dollar should
Slide in a Ferragamo slip
Top of the metropolis
Looking down on your confidence
Hooking up with your confidant
Cooling feels like the comp is gone
Uh hoes in my sweaters
Hoes be over zealous
Hold it down dirty as hell
When we roll to town
Whats up with all these clowns
I gave you years how dare you doubt me
Even when I aint here you hear about me

And he likes that nutrition that packs a punch
For breakfast two blunts a six pack for lunch

7167,"ELE 2 The Wrath of God Lyrics
What up What up 
Im sorry your time has come
No God is present today
They need to be afraid
You need to be afraid today because the God of justice is present now
Thats why he said Vengeance is mine
The battle is not yours the battle is the Lords and God has come
The battle is on and the plagues are coming down
And no Im not afraid but you need to be and especially when you see whats coming up
Because as a man soweth the same shall he also reap
And when you have done the evil that youve done to us
And done it to others
Did you never think that there would come a day
When you would have to pay for all that crap that you have done
Thomas Jefferson said it right brother
He said I had trembled for my country
When I reflect that God is just
And that his justice cannot sleep forever
Well his justice has awakened
And all over the world the nations are turning right before our eyes
And thats why Trump is saying We gotta make America great how when Again
Because shes not great today
People are not afraid
The world has taken enough of Americas evil so death is sweeter
The son been continuing to live under white supremacy and under tyranny
So in all I dont care nothing about them investigating me
Or arresting me or even killing me
But Ill tell you what
Ill tell you what Ill give you a little warning
You killed your last man when you killed Dr King you will not get that chance to do that to me
And if it pleases God that you do kill me right after you kill me all of you gon die
Cause Im not here by myself Im not here of myself
You can see that God must be backin me
Otherwise where would I get the strength to say and do what I do
No man its our time now
God has sent me to make you all feel the wrath and cometh
Im here to heat up and beat the street up Im back to punish
While Trump is present with a mouth screamin louder than trumpets
While you bow to the puppets Ima stand and stick around for the judgment
Use the world stage with a God crown to put it down for the public
The Earths in pain with a large pound of demonic indulgence
These devil consultants when our streets whine I read minds of the culprits
Kind of repulsive to expose em through rhymes that Im pumpin
Shits kind of disruptive when I talk now line up the subjects
Im tired of injustice from the popes politicians and judges
When you witness the abuse of power sometimes its seductive
Then I question God why create a creature that is so destructive
Hold all your grudges and focus while you create expenses
Every man is free of choice but no man is free of consequences
Hold your suggestions and listen closely I study lessons
Causing rain hail snow and earthquake and travel dimensions
The groundll rattle the Earth will rumble like a stampede of cattle
Eleven hundred twenty feet per second faster than sound travel
How many more protests How many more marches
Zero results its so grotesque dont even get me started
Then count on my mama she knows best fight for the dearly departed
God is the armor we so blessed lets zoom in on a target
From a certificate a merit down to a felony
For ones actions of these justices will reward a penalty
Pants too tight nigga its been part of the plan fool
They fucked around and made the demasculinization of man cool
Appreciate my pop never stop til the death of me
Raise the silly men and Ill never disgrace my legacy
Fuck following trends that dont make us men is the recipe
Care for your women your mother and children its necessity
In the last couple of years you niggas look like you need therapy
Mentally it appears as if the imbalance is chemically
How you gon try to stop Gods work
That could never happen even after Im back in the Lords dirt
Im here to present the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2
Im only here to present and bring the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2

Jeeps rockin beats in the streets when theres time for hangin out
Gather or rather form a circle around a loud
Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because hes runnin off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin to play a nigga out
Nope shut him down the king with a crown
Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down
Down with the king
The king down with the king 
The king
Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme Im about to say
The rhyme was meeca and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts wearing Godfather hats
Its okay to parlay to forte better
Tell em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and Ill wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon now your dumb ass is leakin
CL and Run DMC so rush it
Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma no shoelaces
And Im
Down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King
Im takin the tours Im wreckin the land
I keep it hardcore because its dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not meant for a ho like a slow jam check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only GOD could be a king to me
And if the GOD be in me then the king I be
The microphone is branded when its handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw
Down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King
Im the man you see in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic a full swinger
The P to the R not an RB singer
The R to the UNDMCn
The fly human beings tonight I hold the key and
Flowin with the funk track here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin
Had skins yawning
Mecca yo you want the mecca yo 
Ill make a funky beat so we can blow check it out
Pete Rocks the beat knock put you in a headlock
And now all the outty out flock is down with the king
Down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king

Uh make it out the hood they say you Hollywood
How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good
Gotta check and treat these niggas like Im Robin Hood
When it was time to stand up for me see nobody stood
And I was lookin at you niggas all the ones I fed
Had me grindin all them nights when you was going to bed
And if you think I owe you something nigga gon ahead
Treat you like I never knew you put it on your head
And I got Papi on my line like When you comin home
My mama see it in my face she know that somethin wrong
Bodies droppin in my city all summer long
Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin on
Cause I cant let em take my life you might get left you make that right
When he got left it wasnt right but he was tryna live that life
I call up Coon to book that jet we like three deep we take that flight
Used to land in California to play that studio all night we stayin down
For the love of them millions aint layin down
Left you in the hood what you sayin now
And niggas wanted the smoke you said Stand down uh
Cold heart never get cold feet when the pressure come
It was beef I had to tell niggas You better come
Sister said they gettin over its like you lettin them
Some shit I had to learn my lesson from uh
Checkin in checkin out I just had to check you out
2012 it was 50 niggas when Im steppin out
Forgot the time you asked me for a check and I aint lend it out
I aint even know you was upset thats what this shit about
A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater
When you cant bring up one time you returned me for a favor
So I pray these niggas real close talkin closer than my neighbors
Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides catch them vapors
Used to be my dawg you was in my left titty
Scream Ride or die I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous you wouldnt even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
Used to be my dawg you was in my left titty
Scream Ride or die I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous you wouldnt even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
See I look at it like this
What Im supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio rappin my lights out
Goin city to city cant take my son to school when I want to cant see my mama my family when I want to
They give a nigga my money then act like he hangin with me
I aint never been sweet
Far as I can remember every time I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself
I aint never even think about a nigga callin my baby mama to pick my son up to take him to the movies
Go play basketball while Im doin this time in the cell
Actin like I owe you somethin
See it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me about that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master on the front of that shit
I used to hear niggas niggas that I was feedin I heard em whisperin Meek Mill finished
I was like And damn I was feedin you bro
All I did was keep grindin
Through the storm nigga Im like Derrick Rose on a 50point night on a daily basis nigga
For the love of the millions royalty over loyalty never get it confused
I got real friends and family thatll never turn their back on me for the love of the money
I got a homie thats doin lifehe cant offer me no money he cant offer me nothin but a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So dont come to me talkin bout no money shit nigga
So if you feel some type of way about my money we goin to the furthest extent to protect that plate that goes in front of my son on the table nigga
One love to all my family and friends that stayed down through all the madness
While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line
One time for my mom and sister that never changed on me even before I had money
Ride or die no matter what
Dreamchasers for life you dig
Uh I told niggas stop askin me where niggas at
If you dont see em in the pictures with me that mean they faded away
I got niggas I distanced myself from we love each other its all love but everybody cant make it
Niggas wanna burn a bridge and expect you to send a yacht huh Where they do that at

Wishing on every star that shines at night
It could be Ive been counting too much on stars and fountains
That only twinkle and sprinkle me with water
But it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
Said it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
I spent my last ten dollars on some perfume
And I thought it said the things I couldnt say
The storeman guaranteed that this was what I need
But it turns out that it wasnt worth a quarter
Cause it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
Said it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
The only girl your mamas got
And anyone can see that she loves you a lot

6993,"I couldnt help but notice your pain
My pain
It runs deep share it with me
Theyll never take me alive Im gettin high with my fourfive
Cocked on these suckas time to die
Even as a youngster causin ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin up dust
But now Im labeled as a troublemaker who can you blame
Smokin weed helped me take away the pain
So Im hopeless rollin down the freeway swervin dont worry
Im bout to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me what should I do
I had to feed my fuckin family what else could I do
But be a thug Out slangin with the homies
Fuck hangin with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger never been a stranger to homicide
My citys full of gangbangers and drivebys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse mind full of sick thoughts
And I aint goin back to court so fuck what you thought
Im drinkin Hennessy runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be 23 Theres so much pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Years and years of that rough life
Runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife
And livin trifed on the regular buckin out competitors
See em fake a move and chase em down like the fuckin Predator
Get in trouble every day in school act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin off for the bitches cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop pop pop and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo currency kept passin me by but I didnt cry broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin coke
And now the moneys lookin lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick em the game its all the same
I kick it back yo give em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman you heard man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn At least Im realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo ass twisted so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan kickin major dust
So if you owe nigga look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame its a deep game
And my mama always cryin yo theres so much pain
Ohhhh
So tired so tired
Ohhhh
Soso
They got me mobbin like Im loced and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I aint scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck cause I aint lookin when Im bblastin
Im a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Dont wanna die tell me why Cause this stress is gettin major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until Im dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
Im real they cannot see and every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin on the streets and Ill be ballin loc
Dont let em make you worry keep swingin at these suckas til you buried
I was born to raise hell a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother Im touched
Out kickin dust up ready to bust
Im on the scene steady muggin mean until they kill me
Ill be livin this life I know you feel me theres so much pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

Tired of the strain and the pain

3514,"I Find it Hard to Say Rebel Lyrics
I find it hard to say
That everything is alright
Dont look at me that way
Like everything is alright
Cause my own eyes can see
Through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see
Is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap
And easy to be wasted
As history repeats
So foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say
Against these laws of man
Cause like the Bible says
His blood is on their hands
And what I gotta say
And what I gotta say is rebel
While today is still today choose well
And what I gotta say is rebel
It cant go down this way
Choose well choose well choose well
Choose well choose well choose well
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete
And nothing and no one can replace it
No no no no no no no no no no no no
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
Is rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel
Rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel
Repent the day is far too spent rebel rebel
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up and rebel
We must destroy in order to rebuild
Wake up you might as well
Oh are you oh are you satisfied

Why dont you rebel

3890,"You know when I first heard this song
The lyrics the melody the way it was being sung
I said man thats the lady I need to go out and find
A lady that will stay with you through the transition of time
The yes the nos the maybe sos
Come on Temptations lets sing this song
When your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you till were seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twentythree
And Im thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old its evergreen
And baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
And Im thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe its all part of a plan
Well Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
So baby now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
So baby now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud

Sheisty and twosided profession dick rider

And when Cyrus got up and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin niggas up like a vacuum
Bullets flyin nonstop and bodies droppin
Puff yelled Away Thats the cops then
My trigger finger started itchin
Then Cyrus came spittin from the kitchen

On the wind I feel his breath
Golden eye I found his weakness
Golden eye hell do what I please
Golden eye no time for sweetness

Youll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child

How it feels to be the one whos left behind
Youll never know the days the nights
The tears the tears Ive cried
But now my time has come
And time time is not on your side
See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls they gather around him

Hi there how are you Its been a long time
Seems like weve come a long way
My but we learn so slow
And heroes they come and they go
And leave us behind as if were supposed to know
Why
Why
Why do we give up our hearts to the past
And why must we grow up so fast
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend its nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember places to go
Pretty maids all in a row

5645,"Put one in the air like the kings son
For the heir to the kingdom
That means Imma be the king once the king done
If he dont wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him
I sing some but I rap a lot like the kings son
Microphone checker all across the board you should king him
Diamond mine my mind make princesses like king cum
Every second worth of thinking
Is enough to fill three rings like Ringlings
Thats how I kept it on the air is like a rerun
And kept the kings comin in obscene sums
You see for me its life or death like a king thumb
Mean something
Thats why I dont play when I relay like a team run
And treat every single day like a scene one
Outlook on life like I aint never seen none
I keep my back to the past tell it bye bye 
Face to the future tell it hi hi 
Everything is super so is fly fly 
Come and stick the fans up
Go on and get your hands up high

Post coast to coast gotta dose of every lingo
The latest famous 80s baby like the dingo
Who evaded pushing daisies dodge bullets like Remo
Remember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo
Used to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps own
Now I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones
Haters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones
Had a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on
Even if Im injured Im gonna limp into the end zone
From game one to the super like Karrine dome
That mean I went to Disney World and you just went home
Its Lupe and I aint from there
But they root for the away
Yeah they stunned there
Beautifully I play
Gatorade the coach and tubas need to play now
Usually I stay put em on the roof with more truth for me to say
I keep my back to the past tell it bye bye

Ferrari bout as red as when Carrie was the prom queen
Think outside the box like Larry Merchant Don King
A glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs
Yeah keep em in the air like a swan wing
And Imma keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing
And my little shop with my terracotta pot
You be talkin bout your kush you should come and hear my lawn sing
So put them up like a robbery
A Derrick Rose lob to me
And watch and see I alleyoop it properly
Football or volleyb hockely or sockely
You just get the rock to me
Try and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie
Ill lock you in a locker b
Like Bruce Leroy locked Johnny in a locker see
Shock is the only thing that 2Pac is toppin me
Hot as rocket bottoms or Kilauea lava be

7557,"Holy Ghost Remix Lyrics
Tell to myself still on fire
Im under attack but Im still on fire
I got some chatter but Im still on fire
I got some threat but Im still on fire
I got some liabilities but Im still on fire
If its not amazing that Im on fire
Ive been to hell and back but Im still on fire
Whats in the back of my mind sittin in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here thats what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin heavy weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out but you dont have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin for draws and now theres plaques on the walls
Think Im sellin my soul Then you can come get em all
Trade em all for my dawgs yea Im talkin to you
Where did we go wrong Because I dont have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But its real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life you didnt deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look its somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame I charge it all to the game
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga half a mili automobile
Im talkin real luxury dont feel a bump in the road
We aint like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin it really had me disgusted
Nigga who am I kiddin It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didnt ask for it back
And to be honest with you I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we got each other
Woulda done anything took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin large
Gangster pitted it kills gave you your first mill
And I aint tell you to blow it I aint tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure yea I know it can stress ya
But youre only a man homie I aint mad at ya
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I swear the Lord is my shepherd Im bout to go cop a Lexus
Im bout to go fuck Alexis take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and em these my Usher confessions
Let it burn TeeTee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two Ts and Top Dawg impress with
TVs that play their investment
KDOT go tee off and TGs and YGs gon press it
Its our turn I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo curse you forever you better not touch it
The clutching Im used to 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga Vrrrrm
Check that homie out homie thats KDot 
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
Its hard to say when Im neutral Im tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em

Hit the afterburner Ike Turner how I drop a bitch
Im so far ahead Im already dead
Getting at you from the future
Thats why Im used to what you said
Wait until you see the new superhead
She got the turbo wop hot karma sutra in the bed
I got your yard on my card back to future wit the bread
I pull your card you a fraud hope they shot you in your head
Boy your pockets in the red you fronting and ya style phony
Every day a trending topic keep the pound on me
Exotic women heavy leaning thats how Im living
The punch line king on the run from Robin Givens
Every week a nigga leak a bunch of robbings killings
Fuck a hater make a million let survival feed him
Still stand where I stood they love me the hood
Them bitches talking about me thats how Im doing good
Understood Im good they love me in the hood

I love to get paper and spend it on these clothes
Do you hear me
Understood Im good they love me in the hood
Be in here with the weapons on blink get your necklace torn
Hef the don fucking on your sister like Escobar
Escalade eyes bloody red like Ive been pepper sprayed
Sex for exercise bitches screaming when I step on stage
I get busy dough from here to Quebec Im paid
Fuckin since a kid then grab weed borret soon braids
I know the neighbors hate my guts I be recking them
My seconds make a twirler stay for months fuck the wrestling
Protects ya neck again like Rae and Meth and em
Im excellent you full of estrogen with a freshman pen
You couldnt cloud my intelligence with elegance
Ill never flinch whip game like they threw the elephants
Im heaven sent living vicariously through these presidents
Done worked my whole life to get two ive been spending ever since
Og kush bags couldnt find a better stench
Fly like D Wilkins and Kemp shootin the bench
Big city to country all the pretty bitches wants me
Toe tags for trying to jump me gun smoking like a junkie
Frying pan man turn your head into a Gumby
When Im hungry aint a a humble bum picture a nigga summy
Sunny everywhere shocked they let you in scummy every year
Pick a spot Im heavy there liquor poppin everywhere
Fucking dimes or something my hora got the telly scared
All problems aborted sons and daughter on your belly smeared
Rapped in fire black attire shes the appetizer
Humming on my trail all day ima clap her after china
Mr no good hood is ever acid rhymer
Shorty fly as hell about 11 levels past Cubana
Im honored loaded lama niggas hate ya honor
Donna Karen Sharen Chanel in my hotel

Dont come in any closer Uh 
And no one will get hurt
Cause I dont know how long I can hold my heart in two Uh 
A rebel I be one day
On that track with Gunplay
Outoutcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andr Uh 
Beef is on my entre Yeah 
Gin and juice thats Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way I swear life is like a oneway Uh 
Pussy on a Sunday Yeah 
Business on a Monday Yeah 
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway Uh 
Come be my fiance
She fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge just sit around and watch her sunbathe Yeah 
Dinner date for one K Bitch 
Shopping date for two K Bitch 
Bougieass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days Yeah 
Finally got it today Uh 
Swear to God my mood changed Uh 
Top off like toupees drop off touch Bitch 
Yeahyeah my mouth is full of gold and Im a city boy Yeah 
And my outfit was in Vogue Im a pretty boy Uh 
Bounce boy Flacko tell em holler at a nigga G Yeah 
Ridin on my enemies Yeah 
This my ghetto symphonyny Uh yeah 
Uh yeah uh yeah 
Uh yeah uh yeah 
Stop
Louder
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Whipwhippin Whitney my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin and lockin up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle she know its dismissal
Spread the news Im official now hop out my foreign vessel Uh 
Before I get aggressive forget it warready
Already tested tears and blood invested
Til my cardiacs arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that Uh 
Black magic on the tires only I
Rollrollin down a lonely mile phony smile
Warrants police on me now still tourin
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Dont complain I came to reign from here forward
Still noid so crib got clear doors
Burnin planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports Uh 
Stop
Louder
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer
Dont come in any closer Uh 
Since Rocky spit like Andr
Im gon kill em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entre
Eat em like cookies Chips Ahoy
Mm enjoy when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas thatll kill for joy
Either Gunplay runway trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking how fast you could grip a 9
Damn look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin wine
Guess thats why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil for these freakin lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died

You want a hit
Ugh 
Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
Yo

And let my balls hang like Im on a toilet taking a shit
My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip Drip 
Fuck all that sensuous shit Drip 
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your clique holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If your if was a spliff wed be all fucked up Word up 
No need to ask you Who is he Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard on many rough cities
Chicago LA any of em Ill have to Norman Bate you Yeah 
I love ta hate you cause yous a freak by nature
Cant wait to face ya mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight with no chaser Word up 
My verbal combats like a miniMac to your back Uhhuh

The LOD love good confrontation or vamp Word up 
Break your concentration murder your camp Haha 
For the jealous overzealous we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis Bombombom bombombom 
Niggas coming through and acting wild Word 
Yall commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile

Forgot what I already knew ayo you hear me friend
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Secret society trying to keep they eye on me Nah nah 
But Ima stay incogni in places they cant find me

You get backslapped so hard make ya nose bleed Ahh 
Some def kids feeling guilty bout the space shit

Everything is real not just a song that we sing Word up 
From my life to the paper What very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three

Without acknowledging this man as GOD

Ugh now who the fuck you think you talking to

Runnin this racket from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
Id rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitchass niggas know we stronger than these weaklings
Seeking for respect that aint there
Knuckleheads beware theres mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulette this mans wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razorwhich I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spat out at any adult that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Mad at the fact that somebodys getting lucci thats not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture
Joey Crack aka Keyser Sze

7983,"I do dirt in search of a clear mind
Money talk somebodys gonna hear mine
Grind early before 930
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death you heard me
My world aint worldly any time could be my time
I get high but still aint seen Chicago skyline
In my prime stakes is high cause its beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents we want the same face
And to think me and the president we from the same place
Fourhundred and twentyone murders aint tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven will I make it through the main gate
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Ah yes my Lord
Ah ah ahah ohohoh

Ah ah ahah ohohoh
Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap he was about to get put on
At his funeral listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming I hurt for em
A cold world thats why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
Ima need to go back I gots to get em
Back and forth in these streets thats the rhythm
Revenge is posed to be the Lords but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch cost my man his life
I cant afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

Aint wanna push kis Heaven couldnt wait
I was hurting couldnt get no work
You created me from dustthats why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now Im in a hearse whats this cash really worth
My whole life I had to worry bout eating
I aint have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the Kingdom for Chicago gon come
Im coming back like the Prodigal Son and I got a son
And I dont want my ways following him
The streets swallowing him and I dont want no hollows in him
His mama say she see his father in him hope its the good things
Til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates cause I know youve forgiven what Ive done
Im your son do I have the keys to get in
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Sweet Lord Jesus tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning fathers seed
Got a shipment by the sea see my niggas tryna eat
Eat whatevers on your plate save some for me
The worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to Heaven cause I couldnt get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back cause these stripes aint free
We still wading in the water
Cocaine blunts marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell em Talk is cheap niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust leave the praying to my mama though
Another motherfucker out of control just walking my soles
Whoa littered with the abuse
They wasnt for show I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day barefaced giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you They know me on the streets where I grew
If you aint from round here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for the keys to the kingdom
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

5830,"Something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects man
And thats how we roll roll
You know Im well known like Al Capone fully blown like Ton Montana
In a zone sittin on chrome stoned sippin on champagna
Rollin ganja up in Bible paper see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ John Elijah Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream bustin out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard deemer medallion
Mockin God even Italians see my battalion propped abroad
I got the Squad overqualified pullin over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted threewheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And thats how we roll roll
I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat
What you broke motherfuckers know about that
Lookin fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly blown Benz chrome rims 
Shinin like the stone gems on my gold rings 
I got it sewn Twinz I cant begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
Ive been a killer and a drug dealer a bugged nigga
But now Im like Puffy cause moneys thicker than blood player
Im still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together and figure which cleaners the best for the hit
I get the job done Puns handlin business
Candlelight dinners havin a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses so expensive my whole familys religious
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And thats how we roll roll
Aiyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
Long as my crews official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
Im tryna triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God FullAClips and myself thatll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
Im on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin
Im infinite like math so Im gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day bullshit and sittin on your ass
Im all about cash and the power
A stash with the powder that lasts like hittin ass for an hour
Lets get it locked I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops we got Deserts and Glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryna stop our cheddar from stockin forever
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And thats how we roll roll
Big Pun is the largest thang

Your instructor for today is Tech N9ne
This is style I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick monotone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern bust out that quick Middlewest chatterin
Some people hate but it aint matterin
But the people gather its flatterin
Switchin the pitch mixin theres no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission full bliss when I be rippin this shit
Make it exciting got to be inviting when youre writing your piece
Never be dick riding if youre going to be biting youre igniting the beast
This is melodic melodies if you got it
Mix it hot as tamales you singin offkey its garbage
If you cant keep an octave in a pocket you need to stop it
Have confidence speak with conviction
Dont put em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony Ninas taking you through it
Make it buttery utterly beautiful make it fluid

From our West Coast instructor Crooked I
My killer cadence can keep me crushin the competition
Comin correct when creatin the crazy composition
Cannibal character Calico carrier got a crooked copper missin
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant consonant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty if Im thirstay
I change the pronunciation of words per se
The English language got to do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap this is how this is how 
Right now Im puttin swag in my style in my style 
Its an emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give em charisma with a laugh and a smile and a smile 
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes got to be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example this song is a war zone and you listeners in the crossfire
Get on your feet up out your seat
Get on your feet up out your seat

Bullets flyin up and Im numbin the bum like its Vicodin
So much metal in his spine he could get rich from the recycling
Chino be curdlin blood dont get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction like what Da Brat just heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love industry hate me yo
Id rather hear Hannah Montana than half of you rappers on the radio
Startin drama with Chino God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay thats God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man
With a sick delivery like I drive a coroner van

Grenade grippin and fittin to detonate Disneyland

5031,"Yeah
You know 1990 begins a new decade
Since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
Its been a three four year stretch
And Id just like to thank all of you
Mmm
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
That means the United States overseas in the UK
Way in Brazil Japan Africa and everywhere else
I just wanna dedicate this one to you
Heres another groove that Im bringin to you kind of mellow
And I just want to say hello
Or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that dont cease never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
Cause Im so smooth
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
Ill have you dancin in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of BIG
DAdoubleDY Kane in the place
Doin the job how you want it done
With lyrics thats bright as the mornin sun
So grab one line rub it on your face like sunshine
And everythin elsell combine
This is that particular beat
For all the fellows feelin mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uhh also for every girly
To shamiyo shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh now wait now wait now wait a minute
Uhh Now check this
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Not one but all of the above
Comin together like keys on a piano
Black and white to unite and oh man oh man
What joy do we find
Hard for me to say it sometimes
Nothin can stop this flow so back up off me
Hold your cup of Folgers wake up and smell the coffee
Big Daddy Kanes the name of the one and only
You wanna say it three times like Tony Toni Ton
Its not an avocation of being the best
But I at least deserve a cape or an S on my chest
Quote The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
Mmm they shoulda never turned me loose
Cause Im a true livin Casanova
Smooth and stylistic and suave bowler
And they say nasty couldnt even tell it
Cause when Im with girls I get Funkadelic
So ladies stand still as I start to fulfill
Just chill the scenerys about to get ill
The places I feel to give your body a thrill
As I rub you the right way like Johnny Gill
And competition take notes from a champ
You once had this but all your girls broke camp
And now you wanna diss
You swung but you missed
So now tip your hat and bow down to this
Who The father of civilization
With knowledge of self under any situation
The F to the I to the V to the E
The PERCENT
That means an Asiatic king just rocked it
And left your mouth wet with a taste of chocolate
Thats right yall and thats right yall
My rhymes freshen the air like Lysol
Girls uh right there yeah right there

5871,"Yo Im getting older now 23 years old
And half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down
The other halfs like Hell no you better mess around
Dont let me down especially when you got an album coming out
When I first saw you Im like Aw shit
Goddamn it look what God did Hail Mary Jesus
Three years later Im sitting in our apartment
Thinking about all the places that my hearts been
I mean its crazy right this is maybe wife
The one that found me in a drought pulled me out and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now youre leaving town
Another couple thousand miles south which leads to crazy fights
And I dont know how to deal with it
I gotta be real with ya
Each day I get filled with the
Feeling of realer love we wanna continue it but
This aint the same old love song
Cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
But you know what makes it worth it
To watch someone progress to have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry to
Its something so comforting cause it could bring so much truth
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesnt move
The commitments to yourself and that youre always learning
To acknowledge youre both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person but as an individual entity
And then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary but its so complex
The most delicate balance to get away from attachments
But it can work Im attempted nah were living it
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that come on
Every time
I cant
Ignore you
Every time I come around
I see your face
Always moving
Yo just working on dependency
Sometimes the thing you love the most in this world you just gotta let it be
It hurts to have to set it free
And if it does or doesnt work we both know that it was meant to breathe
Cant hide from experiences
And theres so many people out there in this world were gonna find interesting
Its only a matter of time before that right connection
Thousands of miles away what you expect
You see Im wondering where are you
Tearing the label off of a beer as Im sitting at this bar stool
You would tell me not to call you
To never use you as a fall through to sit with my emotion
But the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feeling lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you
When you die just know the best time of my life has been loving you
I love you you know
Lets get em come on
We been together
But in my head
We would break apart
I would hold my heart tied inside
But you knew that my soul
Could not be
Given to anybody
Easily woahohoh
Woahohoh
Woahohoh woahohoh
Its a beautiful thing isnt it
One more time Ev Every time
I cant
Ignore you It feels good dont it 
Every time I come around
I see your face Yes 
Always moving

7501,"Its On feat JayZ Lyrics Beanie Sigel 
Bare witness to the greatest cant beat us join us
Keep heaters on us with red lasers
Now far warning short shots wont graze ya
We hug corners play blocks like gators
With bundles on serve tres like waiters
Its the life we chose the hustle
Cant stop it cant knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggas tryna break tables
Stack chips like Connect 4
While you pricks try and whip tryna stretch more
Charge less for that aint the program
Getcha lessons from the snowman
Like Pilsbury I get the dough man
Ill off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and Im true to my peeps
Gimme a bird and my crew gon eat
Im over the stove like Cuban Linx
Breakin down Cash Money like Baby do
You niggas soft like baby food
Round the world niggas pay me dues
While you niggas sing the same old song like Sadies do JayZ same song 
Grown man nigga baby who
I send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool propane flow flame you dudes

Know that
You feel like KoolAid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
Like a salad no dressing take you to your favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They dont ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and Im the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And Ima buy a summer house with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I dont
I wont say I wont eat it if you chef it
Fuck it Ill hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me great and powerful Ossie
Whos behind the man behind the curtain Foxy coffee
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin oh wait it wasnt
Oh and I forgot Ill take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like your sister maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh isnt that sweet
You feel like KoolAid in a wine glass

I laughed at her we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
What if you and I were just letters
Thatd be unfortunate wed have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay thats a dead subject you bring it up thats a zombie
You remind me of my memory aint what it used to be
She said she aint trippin I know because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
Ill be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window

6393,"Those who create literature know firsthand
Just how difficult creating music can be
There are no options now
If I werent a writer I think Id be a total psychological mess
Out of the Umbilicus Mundi this is lyrical lunacy
From a human being to speak so fluently
Bars of poetry without precedence
Complete par excellence listen to the Levitibus Testament
To understand me you need help
You gotta see the film The Day After Trinity written by John Else
To understand that you must know thyself
You should keep listening cause Canibus flow might help
But you said keep quiet while the emcee raps
others say theyre bad but theyre buggin
Never that Im constantly comin with clever raps
Strung off the rhyme time like a cocaine addict
Im not an emcee who talkin all that junk
Please a lot of suckas would like to forget me but
The incredible lyrical and original
I grab the steel with the chrome on top
To find the answers that we didnt know maybe Edgar Allan Poes
Description of El Dorado is not so
See the reason theres no light at the end of tunnel
Is cause were really not in a tunnel were trapped in a bubble
The government hierarchy and the dregs of society
Can you explain why you believe hell is fiery
Were suffering from symptoms of drapetomania
Slavery isnt over it just took a new alias
The data repository established for the maintenance
Almost turned me into an atheist scared of aliens
Why write lyrics when I make a better livin
Sellin freeze dried venom to wildlife clinics
Cause I hate the thought of bein a predictable bore
Once you get used to me you wont love me no more
The final soliloquy of the internal paramour
What are we all to do when rap music is gone
I hope God and the imagination are one
A golden tongue can achieve synchronicity with the sun
Transcended beyond the flesh and the blood
Cause this is level one after this album my message is done
But you said keep quiet while the emcee raps
others say theyre bad but theyre buggin
Never that Im constantly comin with clever raps
Strung off the rhyme time like a cocaine addict
Im not an emcee who talkin all that junk
Please a lot of suckas would like to forget me but
The incredible lyrical and original
I grab the steel with the chrome on top
But you cant battle me so youd rather embarrass me
I maintain dignity in the face of calamity
They reach out their hand to me and talk dishonestly
But I read through their syntactic structure like Noam Chomsky
A student so overzealous I motivate my trainers
Id rather get some now then get some later
Take a break from writin rhymes on paper recondition my character
Change my nature with seven days of Vipassana
Let go of the stress man I was deeply depressed
So famished in fact I needed a rest
To regenerate my mind
Bless the cornerstone of my rhyme with corn oil and wine
Then see the light an illuminous paradigm
It became more apparent with time
All I had to do was follow the signs
To be a better man I need help
Ive just got to find the link between my inner deity and myself
But you said keep quiet while the emcee raps
others say theyre bad but theyre buggin
Never that Im constantly comin with clever raps
Strung off the rhyme time like a cocaine addict
im not an emcee who talkin all that junk
please a lot of suckas would like to forget me but
the incredible lyrical and original
I grab the steel with the chrome on top
People are usually terrified of poetry
And they dont realize that its just speech
It is language that is sometimes extraordinary
But there are ways to deal with it without worrying about it the way they do

8060,"I Do Remix Lyrics
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said now what it is what it do homegirl aint got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up flip it down weigh it up break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya whos ya daddy now
Aint even gotta open your eyes know what your looking at
And I aint even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight eye contact
Remember the night we first met I caught a contact
Now shes my ride or die its us against the world
You know we both hustlin so hustlin is our world
Said I mustve had too much to drink Im in my GMode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause its the GCode
Promise if I get locked youll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me youll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me its gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets youre gon be my lucky charm
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Man that boy so cold give him a blanket in here
I do I do I do oh oh
I Vito promise to treat this game ideal
Honor the code not bring drama to mamas peephole
Lifes a bitch but shes the only love that I know ow ow
So laadee after the I Dos lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot lets grab us a pot lets make a baby
Looking back I dont know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully cut that cake for me
I JayZ take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until Ive amassed a fortune too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never ever ever ever
Your secrets I treasure for better or worse
Youll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up my verse up
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
Unh Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know Im just a boy that a woman could make a man of
So make me one I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when shes 81
Please dont give it all away I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around there more jaded that they become
But this one special so I make sure my suit will fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85 Im too legit
Im just tryna get her in the mood
And having her doing all the things shed only do when she get married
So lets do this shit
Tell the reverend all we missing is his blessing
Because before she popped the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchanged vows they clapped we take a bow
And shell be doing tricks for daddy when we take it to the house
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do

Shovel on a little more coal

Watch old 97 roll
And then a telegram came to Washington station
This is how it read
It said That brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying down in Danville dead
He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Dont you speak hard words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return

Through the mans mind God

See this where he begin to know that where he come from
See some people dont have no direction God
Because they dont know the science of they self
See the signs of life is the signs of you
All the elements that it took to create you
Everything thats in the universe God
Thats created the universe God is just within you
You see what Im sayin
And thats the mind that you cant see
Dont you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out God
Hell fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes oninside
So you mean to tell me Im the creator of all this right here
You the creator of all this
Because all these things must happen it must take place
See people go back in the day God
They say one man one woman Adam and Eve there aint no such thing
Everything you see always has been and always will what be

Blow his back out make his shoes worth
Ayo this shit be off the noggin rock it
Whatever cock block it
Cat get blown who own this street corner
Foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer
Navy Seal top runner rhyme this summer
For real marinating niggas skating
Debating waiting style flowingly relating

Yo hit me for these Tommy Hill icerocking niggas
Peace this summers mines I blow the biggest
Back up off me while I grab my dick and hold the Heini

Tackle clubs never rock Lugz Im way above

Its like the pennant seminars the playoff
Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off
This specialist who eyeballed your mistress necklace
Perpetuous this curlyhead kids treacherous
Let go the eggo so we can dip dip dive like Lego
Throw on cancan eat that plus this instrumental
Ah shit say Starkologist
Starksologist fried fish halibut
Pull out the bull horn lets celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside Loud and got on
I played the building burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims Gin Pepridge farms from out of millions
Who wanna rhyme who wanna challenge the swordmans
That rock that fisherman hat like Gortons
I hold down the place no shots to the face
Elite Special force no religious style faith
The melting pot boil gun shot drama soil
Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil
Manhandle pain killing erect my hidden
Streets made me potent put your 96 bid in
Vampire curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water axe slaughter through my earth
Youre hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain peak holds the globe like vagina

Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
Golden Eye Spy vs Spy guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer mic in dead body position

Im going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Climb into my machine so we can cruise on out
I know a swinging little joint where we can jump and shout
Its not too far back off the highway not so long a ride
You park your car out in the open you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her maam
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed
Oh Carol dont let him steal your heart away
Im going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
And if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight pat your foot dont let them carry it away
Dont let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Oh dont the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
You cant dance I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby because you dance so good
Oh Carol dont let him steal your heart away
Im going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Dont let him steal your heart away
Ive got to learn to dance if it takes you all night and day

5875,"Dr C PhD Lyrics
Doctor C
Yo I plan to build myself a facility before Im forty
A molecular archeogenetic laboratory
That can analyze complex poetry data for me even if it was recorded poorly
How extraordinary
I frog leap over awkward beats
Then I separate rappers by their Carbon14s
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
I put a curse on your name bombard your brain
With gamma Xrays til you burst into flames
With the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal viable style
Its like trying to ride a bull
Lets have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice CedarsSinai room
So I can get sick as the flu spittin the truth
If you aint got this album you missing the proof
Prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes
Glow against the pale background of the Moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning your flammable boxes of booze
Got in the groove even though Im not in the mood
Motherfucker you didnt win cause I cant lose
Give the fans the chance to choose fuck you
Whos the illest Whos it really up to
Rapping fire you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire
Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up
Cause you said Bis aint dope you a damn liar
Disaster for hire over beats by Kyros
Flow like the Tigris Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Canibus is a fighter
Motherfucker my great grandfather was Irish
Lets roll the dices Ill break you like young Tyson
Give me the mic man I dont need no hype man
Put a thousand on me put one on him
I tear off his limbs throw him in and tell him to swim
Yo I soak that sugarcoated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss turn that noise off
Call Detroits Mafia Boss
Tell him Yo I got a job for you I want you to bust his balls
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
Im the best there ever is and the best ever was
Training like a grunt face down in the mud
With blood sweat and tears sucking it up
Yo you wonder where I am right now
Im probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Dead or alive Canibus will live through the rhyme
To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine
Spittin divine you cant get it twisted this time
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Doctor C Ph D graduated from UMG
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true MC
With 3D topography maps you cant see
Butcher on Broad Street wrapping CDs
In butcher paper doing artwork with Sharpies
If you dont like the quality then talk to me
What the fuck you on the website for you creep
Punching the keys remember that sound
Thats exactly what it sounds like when Im punching your teeth
Kick a rap bitch if youve got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me I might put a lump in your meat
Diss you and your man double the beef
To tell you the truth I thought your rebuttal was weak
Round the outside blah blah et cetera et cetera
The body of my literature is bigger than South America
Nigga look this is all I got to say
Suck my PHDICK

5045,"Verse 1
Who macks the most shit smoke ya whole clique like roach clips
Who flows ramped enough to hold drips and float ships
No mo shifts
I hold enough chips to toast Cris
Its G Rap the cat thats on your wanted most list
I wrote this so you could sweat this and soak this
Get the focus the made family kid not the bogus
Youre crime culprits put hot shit up in you like holsters
Left for the vultures with DTs picking up cultures
Threethousand volt ya just like the third rail
And if you heard shells a herb fell swift with the words well
All on my dirt trail
Kick up enough dust to hurt cells
Swerve the SL so get G murk swell the shirt braille
Curved in jail cells for jakes that wanna Hblock those
Niggas in Pacos keep the block froze and the shop closed
Where the pots grow with young cats coppin the drop Roves
Get the Nachos so no cops show when the shots blow
Shit red hot though
Streets remain flooded with Ds
Bundling Kis to maintain a hundred degrees
Main crime wave we handle a beef in 9 ways
Get your mind grazed from TEC9 sprays your spine blazed
When it get too hot on the block better believe the rhyme pays
Put all you cats in cradles if you crave to find graves
Diamond mind crazed rays blindin you with my shine glaze
Unlike them other rappers that get stuck in a time phase
Wanted for rude intrusions major operating distributions
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse 
Wanted for rude intrusions major operating distributions
Hes a man that came from the bad lands 
Wanted for rude intrusions major operating distributions
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse

Racketeering prostitution paid executions
Verse 2
Made corporation
Body casing watch where you pacing
Thug orchestration
This is live niggas you facing
We paper chasing for that million baby we lacing
Fifty Caliber gat embracing
Leavin you wit legs without sensation
Whos full of malice Who thug the wildest
Act childish get your body sent to a stylist
Who live the foulest
Be grippin cannons till my hands are callused
Pile this paper longer than mail list from New York to Dallas
Purchase a palace sip coladas with the whole Borgata
Bodies be dropped while I attend the opera
Land on casino roofs in helicopters
In Las Vegas Nevada
Cant stop until I got a casa up in Trump Plaza
929 Mazda foreign chicks talking with accents like they Zsa Zsa
Mean like Idi Amin Dada
Thug saga
Slugs burn you like they lava
You and your bimbo get hit up through your car window
See you an drift slow and let ten blow
From out the darkest shadow
Remain straight as the archers arrow
I spark this barrel hit my target
Even if the mark is narrow
Lay you like a pharaoh
With fragments inside your bone marrow
Get your wig flown just like a sparrow

8115,"Joey what you said 24 right
Aight cool I got you
I define gutter every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch hiphop got my spine smothered
But Ill be fine brother my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing thats word to my mother
You throw a shot at me Im throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint mines whistling by your top hat
Yeah Im cool but you violate and Ill cock back
Open the macs mouth and black out like I do not rap
Im sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Yall be making up stories the little kids is buyin
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I aint gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong pause
Veterans cosign me the upandcomers scared
The pretty girls go papi heres my underwear
Never in a hundred years I thought Id be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew Id be a factor
Im PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
Youre Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gaps so crazy
Im Gucci Louis V youre Gap Old Navy
I get coochie in the V you attract no ladies
Youre suburb Im gutter where the gats go crazy
Fuck a lecture aint tryna be Puns successor
That terms done fucker what up whatever
You birds is food Im about to pluck some feathers
Im young and clever plus clutch under pressure yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest thatll open your chest like a sunken treasure
Im somethin like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever Im rhyming on or whoever
I tear em apart swear on my pops
No fear in my heart shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks snapped fins with my jaws
Im all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back dumb birds I ignore the hype
Clickclack Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg cross me twice cant afford the price
Itll cost you Ill off your life
You soft I told you Im raw white when Im on this mic
Still mourn at night dont wanna see mornin light
And I feel like Im forced to fight
When the CHiPs are down like Ponch fallin off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome right
I got em in awe my auras Jordan like
Whats really poppin who diddyboppin
You wasnt really now you all Common and really conscious
I aint with that silly nonsense I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggies optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave theyre carvin Fucked with the wrong nigga
I dont write I kill a pen leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin my age
Forever vow to never smile when Im at peace
Only when Im eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemys internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led em in the belly of the beast
Youll be missin until fishermen see your corpse
Ill be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
Im a gorilla behind these bars on some zoo shit
Shoot you while youre talking on some news camera crew shit
Sicker than flyin in past tense on some flu shit
Dayold asshole flow I drop new shit
Exclusive you dont want it in fact
Ill have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you leavin your body he dont wanna go back
Thats when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
Its Crooked I the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat
Nickel yeah
I hope niggas know Ill show up to your show
Ill show up where you go show up to your do foes will explode
Shells fore they hit the floor I know niggas know
I got a open window flow I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why sheeeeeeeeeeeeit
Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like OShea
Ridin shotgun with Chris Martin my DJ
Not the White boy but Im down for the Coldplay
Forever stay violent better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up clap niggas up scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it aint no mo aint no dough
Get into his ass cause I aint opposed Im a livin anal probe
Im a lameophobe matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin why the fuck not 
When I was a teen I used to pack a threeeighty
Now Im spittin sittin between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she aint shave
I leave the booth smellin like somebody aint sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I aint crazy
Im like Marty McFly goin back in time
And dissin his momma nigga you cant fade me
They say he a bastard for real then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin whys he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks I RIP it
So even to the producer its hard to ID it
Bars tremendous its in your best interest
I insist your men just do your best Bush rendish
Endless move more than two inches
My bloodll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me maana
Or see the speed of a llama underground prima donna
That aint hard to find pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E Honda he a monster
I love war its like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin hard I see vagina pause
Nah rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine manoamano
When it rains it pours grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin with Mouse the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle and an eagle eye
Closed casket now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head dudes callin you Crotchface
So yall could bump Swag Like Us
But the next time raps discussed add this as a plus
Dont nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fags might bust
And since poppin tags is a must what 
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin their drawers now your crew is in awe
How you ball your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon need another processor to process it
Ill set it I said it
So keep running around hotheaded til you get hot leaded
Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it niggas is piethetic
Rap what you cant afford yall must got credit
All you gotta know is Crooked I Royce Bless and Joell
With Joe spell NO L

5887,"Well when the moon comes up and the sun goes down
And the street lights start comin on in the town
When the kids go inside and old foks go to sleep
Thats when real Gs come out on the creep
Midnight movin through the city on the low
Sippin on some sizurp and smokin on some dro
Got the TVs on both my screens on flow
Pop trunk on dis bitch and Im ready to go
You never know what the night might hold
After hours motherfuckers act way too cold
You see work gettin bought and work gettin sold
If you real you can roll but if you fake you might fold
Now a days its a struggle to survive
Some of these dark alley ways will eat you alive
Imma grip my grain and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin
Cause we dont come out till after dark
With nothing less than 28 grams of spark
And nothing less than 16 ounces of sip
Everytime that its time to flip
You can find me
Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac
With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back
Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin
We dont give a fuck we just late night creepin
In the late night
Thats w thats w
Thats when real Gs c come out on the creep
I got my two 45s and they loaded and locked
Keep em both on cock for I step on the block
Its the grave yard shit cause we out on the grind
And we dont care about time cause its money on mind
We the first ones out tryin to get us some bread
We aint worried bout sleep fuck goin to bed
We the last ones to leave after hittin them stangs
Take it back to the boulevard with fours on swang
I do my thing and you cant tell me different
Cross the wrong line and your body might skip it
Im programmed automatic with this G shit
And that go for every other cat you see me with
Glock turned on with the burn on the hip
Im blowin on the deuce by the candy painted whip
Imma grip my grain and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin
2X
In the late night better get your face right
Everything sells bitches to the bass pipe
I seen it all eyes redder than a brake light
Blood shot 20 20 through the guage sight

989,"She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing

So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day
All dead all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead all dead
And alone Im spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

At the rainbows end

All dead all dead

You know my little friends
All dead and gone
Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me

Ok lets go talk to em holler
Dont you get tired of hearing niggas say that shit all the time
Why cant you shut the fuck up and rhyme nigga
Yeah yeah
Used to run around getting my fight in the streets on
Back in the day before Harlem had a green zone
What good is a good education with no direction
Like the right to vote with no one to vote for in an election
Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
Like a crowd packed in the front without the midsection
Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
I used to live in the back of a holding van
Used to be offbeat like the white girls shoulder dance
I wrote rhymes a acappella no beat behind bars
Shed blood to make it like the story behind scars
I used to be a battle champion in the meanwhile
Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
Prematurely senile underground prima donnas
I was Oliver North during Iran Contra
Cause I never snitched and thats backed by evidence
I learned it by watching you dont ever forget it bitch
Cause everybody knows how the government do
They never snitch on themselves but they want you to snitch on YOU
Evolution from Australopithecus
Primitive commercial shit to hardcore lyricist
Your wax is useless rappers are dropping like Icarus
Technological revolution nigga picture this
Motherfucka what
Yeah
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
Lyrical bullets packed to the top of the clip now
Treat it like a robbery Im shutting this shit down
Fellas put your hands up and the all the women strip down
Thats not misogynist you ostriches cause I could just apocalypse
Talk politics to the populace
Or challenge what the market is
With militant caucuses
Thatll smash the spirit of Hip Hop out the sarcophagus
This is the curse of Tutankhamen I bring the drama on
Im sinful I eat you broad daylight on Ramadan
Hip Hop reparations now we taking back Delucci
Dont tell me you spent it on coke like Danny Bonaduce
Were tired of being on the outside looking in
Wondering what the fuck Hip Hop wouldve been
This is what it is as opposed to what it used to be
And this is your corporate tax ID eulogy
Dominant species the new breed that wont let you breath
Ill make you die for what I believe
So we got nothing in common
There aint no comparison
You got beef with niggas I got beef with Aryans
White power Nazi European Americans
Rapid Poverty pimps and fake vegetarians
The resurrection ripping a ball through the record section
Flight connection to the Chechen border for guerrilla lessons
Fuck a middle man distributor I got a choice now
This aint Volume 1 I got a grown mans voice now
Toured the country four times over Im older and wiser
Poisonous words youll find strychnine in my saliva
motherfucka what Bring it to em raw 
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
50 caliber bullets I dont need a clip now
Fuck your private jet nigga we shooting the shit down
Bomb wall street and make the stock market dip down
I told you what it was but this is what it is now
You the shit nigga I dont care about shit now
I play the role of Abraham idols get ripped down
Melt the ice caps and make all of this shit drown
No one out there can fuck with me 
motherfucka what 
I speak that real shit 
to smash the airwaves 
I dont want to tell you motherfuckers again

Then Im gonna quit this crazy scene

I was 59 like Royce with the giant voice like Mik Winslow
Never been quite lik them so Im on my own time
Mind darker than a coal mine
Thoughts deeper than a gold mine
So Im out here slangin on this blade
Hopin that I dont get cut by these police
Makin raids on those of us who know whats up
My lil homies my lil sons
Got them keys and they got them drums
Making superstitious runs on them insufficient funds
No more rules in this here shit toddlers packin a revolver
How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber
See you with that heater you sweeter than peach cobbler
If it aint about that paper then man that aint what Reek habla
Man you know whats goin they say Woke about that dope
Ask them fiends about them keys bout that coke bout that smoke
Two fifteen my city man and we it from round here
If its crazy where you at then it aint no different round here
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Yo reminiscin over old times sip a little bit of Oban
When the wind blow like a land mine balled up fist now
Who the fucks this calling on the landline
Back back like a hair line I dont really want the air time
I dont wanna smile for the camera damn I just wanna see my fam rise
I can feel when a man lies tryin to grow old and wise
And Im still fly like airlines stay sharp like samurais
Dip low like Camron Big Show when its slam time
Word to my nigga Anton
Bogarting through this door
Hopin that it dont get shut
By these police makin raids on those of us who know whats up
My lil uzi weighs a ton man I truly aint the one
My lil junior straight from juvie make a movie gangster run
Yall confusin this here shit with some television drama
None of yall lil mamas touching Mr Trotter
Even with that heater you sweeter than peach cobbler
Real ones out here winnin you swimmin in deep agua
Click pow Im a rebel just for kicks now
Been down with the get down
You aint sayin shit sit down
This loud twenty one pound my town
Man we it from round here
If they bout it where you from then it aint no different down here listen
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Oh my God I cant believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know We all got away from you 
Come on watch the garden grow We all got away from you 
Ill see you when you get there
Yeah Alright Ill come home
At the end of the day everybody got good and bad
In every culture in every race
But you also gotta remember where your people at
Cause you always should want to love your people unconditionally no matter what

Italian men call their girls a bimbo
Puerto Rican men call their girls muchacha
Ask me how I know cause Im a girl watcher
Now I must admit that Im a sensitive guy
Cause I cried on Cooley High when Cochise died
But then again at times I may be a mean fellow
Cause I didnt give a damn about the dog Old Yeller
But I love my brother and I love him back 
I wish people of the world could be like that
So shake shake yall shake yall shake yall shake yall 
AND BUST THE MOVE WE MAKE YALL
Brother brother help each other 
Im not Don Pardo or Guy Lombardo
I Love Lucy but Im not Ricky Ricardo
Im just a teen titan that does some mean fightin
Against any sucker MC thats seen bitin
I been through Different Worlds gave them all a try
Kadeem is my man but Jasmines not my Guy
I wonder if the Kane ever Dawns on Lewis
Its a Sin to be Bad but somebodys gotta do it
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust uhhuh 
I can make a nun feel the need for lust true 
I can make a new car start to rust uhhuh 
And outrun the dog on the Greyhound bus
For an MC to try to battle me freestylin
His mind must be somewhere in Fantasy Island
But I guarantee that by the time Im through
I make him feel about the size of the midget Tattoo
Cause I love my brother and I love him back 
And more people of the world should be like that
So swing swing yall swing yall swing yall swing yall 
CHECK OUT HOW WE DO OUR THING YALL
Brother brother help each other 
Rhymes that I write generate much juice
Not like Dr Seuss or even Mother Goose
They said I was a child but then I hit em hard
Yeah its good to send a boy to do a mans job
Well Im the Biggest Daddy of the macks and dons
I keep a fleet of women probably one of thems your moms
A voice so choice that my lips should be bronzed
You got ta give me thumbs up just like the Fonz
Well Im a new jack from the new school too cool
But some of the times I get bizarre word 
And grab the microphone and catch a spell from Melle Mel
And start to yell BRRRRAHHHHH
While Im up on stage I feel that its my duty
To do somethin fly to make you shake your booty
Because I add the flavor just like an onion
The type of guy that grows on ya just like a bunion
But I love you Shane and I love you Kane 
Thats somethin that the whole world needs to gain
So love love yall love yall love yall love yall 
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE YALL
PEACE

When they take away everything you got
And they rub your nose in the funky spot

And it makes you wonder
Why were here at all
Check out the shape of your circumstance

Here comes Jill and she needs romance
But you cant do jack so shut up and dance

Lets do this lets do this
Blow the spot like tea kettle whistles
Federal slugs the leadll kiss you
Infrared burnersll never miss you
All digital hard physical spittle you riddle you
Priest prayin over your body while you in critical
Come in a few give out a doz this what the semi do
See what the Henny and Rmy do
BGF Black Gorilla Family jet Black Godfather finesse
Fifty caliber hole surroundin your chest
Bentley blue steel armored cars with boulder baguettes
We live in effect blaze a gun while poppin a Tec
Recognize killers nigga pop a collar to that
Gorilla breed to the death thats the shit that I rep
Code of silence addicted to havin fattened the violence
AK47 rapidly firin got love for bloodshed and the sirens
Take banana clips to my gun to keep my shit off balance
My heart filled with malice
Yo if you livin thug holla back
My bitches strippin in the clubs let the dollars stack
This ones for all my OGs and street scholar cats
And if a nigga act up funeral parlor cat
Pop a collar to that
Yo wavin cash gun in the stash the click on smash
From rockets that blast yo we in your pockets for cash
Burgundy mask bullets like a surgery slash
Internally burn your staff and dismember your ass
Coroners bag from autops to medical lab
I leave you leakin like Carlito watch your memory flash
Quicksand for fam tied a fuckin brick to your hands
Im sicker with the Henny liquor with the clip to your man
When its on its on do your moms bodily harm
Firstbornll be your first gone beef goes on
Permanent cash put you in the tourniquet fast
Feed you glass and use you to fertilize the grass
Puff green when we fiendin to murder ya whole team
For cream the infrared beamsll shatter your dreams
I flatter your queen and rip her right out of her jeans
Intervene and its the homicide scene for your team
From hideous acts on the one gettin rid of the gats
A nigga back no parole now how pretty is that
The city is trapped bottles popped Phillies is cracked
Niggas is strapped half bent illin spillin they gnac
Cars tinted my rap image too large to mimmick
We mob in it fake niggas dissolve in minutes
Its codes to it real killers they know music
Even hoes on the low at the shows lose it
Courvoisiersippin this slim nigga stay flippin
My ways different duck when the AK spittin
Its more to it verbal wisely all fluent
In real life this is how the dogs do it
Doubleedged sword rep for yall seein the board
See yall home soon its better than seein the morgue
So whats the conflict who wanna Don with this
For the streets strictly we got the bombest shit
Two violent niggas sit at the round table in brown sables
Chains hangin down to the navel
Brooklyn and Queens connect get down fatal
Hold the fourpound stable
Wont hesitate to rock a clowns cradle
Get put in the dirt like ground cable
Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval
That shit yall spit sound fable
American Me style knife in the anal who round to save you
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with a gym star spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggas out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit for me to let it rip across your attic
Never valid with a salad but I toss your cabbage

6228,"Yo lesson number one when you get a chance to grab the mic and get before an audience or get in the recording sound booth and like drop some lyrics man you gotta make it you gotta make it happen You gotta make sure that its some worthwhile shit because everybody aint got that chance you know what Im sayin
I remember way before I ever had a fan and held a mic in my hand
I couldnt really freestyle I wrote some rhymes with my man
Back then I Got It Made was my favorite tune
Shorty wasnt booking shows my first crowd was a lunchroom
1992 I started sneaking in clubs
First time I grabbed the microphone the crowd showed me love
Thats when I realized I had a real gift
Of course my parents didnt understand like I was Will Smith
But I was dedicated as an emcee
So much inspiration 1993
I wrote rhyme after rhyme for a past time
Shared lyrics with my man Decompoze during class time
Met Senim the story goes on
If it wasnt for the love then you know it was wrong
I cant recall a conversation about deals and dolla bills
Since day one its all about the beats and the rhyme skills
Lesson number one you know what Im sayin stay true to yourself know who you are and what you about you know what Im sayin Forget what them fans is talking about what the other crews is talking about know who you are and what you tryin to do and what your mission is on the mic you know what Im sayin and Im tellin you you always land on your feet straight up lesson number one
Im on a mission with soulja vision
Tuning my engines rhymes switch over tracks during pole position
You need to stop and listen to this coalition aint no competition
I roll with Friction and Decompozition 
Gotta take my time when Im dropping wisdom
Operating with Dr Frankenstein creating monster rhythms
It aint about making lots of millions
So I avoid major propositions for my hot inventions
Cause all I need is a pot to piss in
See what I say No way you need to see an optician 
Lyrical Lego doing lots of building
Who is he busy man no time for time Tonka children
That shit is dead instead Im coffin digging
Any opposition come up coffer missing
I drop lines similar to salt water fishing
Murder with the mic they be talkin bout some killings
You know what Im saying a lot of cats out here be talkin about you know what Im sayin what they gonna do you know what Im saying I mean even if you talking about something positive dont talk about it just do it man lesson number one action cause talk is mad cheap you know what Im sayin take that from somebody who knows man yo keep it movin
Now lets keep it moving me and you haulin off
Blowin spots like molotovs the black Gorbachev
Boston hogs walkin dogs and never fallin off
Palmin mics ace in a hole like Arnold Palmer golf
The whack emcee holocaust to the world
To my family and friends they call me Lo they call Silla Ross
Bust rhymes without the blue balls
Rebel with a new cause I used to move yall
But now I make the whole room pause
My lost and found box was a mirror on the bathroom wall
Mystery man revealed be still this wont hurt a bit
We only murder kids that talk abouts they murder kids
Just because you wrote it in pen dont make it permanent
Before becoming emcees you need to learn some shit
You know what Im sayin Lesson number one
Before becoming emcees you need to learn some shit
",Friction and Decompozition Gotta take my time when Im dropping wisdom Operating with Dr Frankenstein creating monster rhythms It aint about making lots of millions So I avoid major propositions for my hot inventions Cause all I need is a pot to piss in See what I say No way you need to see an optician Lyrical Lego doing lots of building Who is he busy man no time for time Tonka children That shit is dead instead Im coffin digging Any opposition come up coffer missing I drop lines similar to salt water fishing Murder with the mic they be talkin bout some killings You know what Im saying a lot of cats out here be talkin about you know what Im sayin what they gonna do you know what Im saying I mean even if you talking about something positive dont talk about it just do it man lesson number one action cause talk is mad cheap you know what Im sayin take that from somebody who knows man yo keep it movin Now lets keep it moving me and you haulin off Blowin spots like molotovs the black Gorbachev Boston hogs walkin dogs and never fallin off Palmin mics ace in a hole like Arnold Palmer golf The whack emcee holocaust to the world To my family and friends they call me Lo they call Silla Ross Bust rhymes without the blue balls Rebel with a new cause I used to move yall But now I make the whole room pause My lost and found box was a mirror on the bathroom wall Mystery man revealed be still this wont hurt a bit We only murder kids that talk abouts they murder kids Just because you wrote it in pen dont make it permanent Before becoming emcees you need to learn some shit You know what Im sayin Lesson number one Before becoming emcees you need to learn some shit,Yo lesson number one when you get a chance to grab the mic and get before an audience or get in the recording sound booth and like drop some lyrics man you gotta make it you gotta make it happen You gotta make sure that its some worthwhile shit because everybody aint got that chance you know what Im sayin I remember way before I ever had a fan and held a mic in my hand I couldnt really freestyle I wrote some rhymes with my man Back then I Got It Made was my favorite tune Shorty wasnt booking shows my first crowd was a lunchroom 1992 I started sneaking in clubs First time I grabbed the microphone the crowd showed me love Thats when I realized I had a real gift Of course my parents didnt understand like I was Will Smith But I was dedicated as an emcee So much inspiration 1993 I wrote rhyme after rhyme for a past time Shared lyrics with my man Decompoze during class time Met Senim the story goes on If it wasnt for the love then you know it was wrong I cant recall a conversation about deals and dolla bills Since day one its all about the beats and the rhyme skills Lesson number one you know what Im sayin stay true to yourself know who you are and what you about you know what Im sayin Forget what them fans is talking about what the other crews is talking about know who you are and what you tryin to do and what your mission is on the mic you know what Im sayin and Im tellin you you always land on your feet straight up lesson number one Im on a mission with soulja vision Tuning my engines rhymes switch over tracks during pole position You need to stop and listen to this coalition aint no competition I roll with

4399,"MVP Lyrics
Ayo spark up the Phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip fore your ass is out
In a street brawl I strike men quicker than lightnin
You seen what happened in my last fight friend Aight then
Ls a clever threat a lyricist who never sweat
Comparin yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolet
And clown rappers Im bound to slay
Im sayin hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah Cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw em they come back
Im comin straight out the NYC
Im down with Diggin In The Crates and Im MVP
If rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Ayo if rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Yo its a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJs who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the mans back with a dance track
So heres your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And every time Im jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flyin saucers
No more iron horses cause Im buyin Porsches
Comin straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri Im MVP
If rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Yo if rap was a game Ill be MVP
The most valuable poet on the MIC
Battles I lose none I make crews run I get fools done
Got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly leave you smelly then take your Pelle Pelle
Im the neighborhood lamper punani vamper
Mess around youll find my silk boxers in your Mommys hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
Im like Heav I got nothin but love for you honey
And since Im lookin slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my Chill 
Im comin straight out the NYC
Raps my JOB and Im MVP
If rap was a game Ill be MVP

Yo if rap was a game Ill be MVP

8162,"I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a 100 the Game spit 3 I said Fuck it
Ima have to show these niggas something
Too easy whod believe me if I said that it wasnt
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didnt think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said Nobody benefits everyone perishes
I tell them this they say Here its time for your medicine
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to 44 4s 22 times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lying
You like red or white wine Lets talk about it Im buying
Lets talk about the Children of Zion excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming Ive mastered it certainly surely
Ill celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it dont coagulate
The sex magik wont work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor more than a rapper
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour then a taser then a laser
Then a maser then a phaser then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why Coup de grce for the coup dtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think Ive had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off I promise you well just talk
No biting allowed just bark dont run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought thought manifests words actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
Im a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself then how would I be
If I do not look tell me how will I see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still cant recognize myself
I dont need anybody but myself
When Im rhyming like this I dont need no help
But thank you for your purchase these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy you wanna be the best you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield ED Fields
Chew MCs like Im eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
Its no use if you cant use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone numbers placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it I dont wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress shes an actress
This is Monster Ball practice Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I dont care if were not the same colour nigga Im your brother
I dont care what you say nigga you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind waves bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing where are you Are you hiding
No I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so Tell the people they need to know
And if you dont think so youre a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say Im crazy I say So tell me something I dont know
Something my psyche profile doesnt show
I dont have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus Answer me
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out No do not go
Where the fuck are you going
400mph wind belts blowing think for a moment
We got to wait it out thats what the trainings about
We have to survive thats what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing
Tough pliable relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I cant rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasnt been made yet
Cause I havent been paid yet not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating I tried to save them they wasnt patient
Responsibility entrusted
Theres only one way for me to prove that I love it thats why Im busting
If you pursue revenge dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that youve made
Musically still producing I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureates my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it concentrate you can hear it
Ive almost perfected this Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you cant forget
Oprah Winfrey dont like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably dont like black
I dont blame her she dont understand its only entertainment
She probably wouldnt feel different if she wasnt famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist if not racist with colour
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon not the sigil this is for real though
I sit down and think when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God even Im stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead thats not fair
Who I talk to Go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
I procured a small piece of the treasure collections from a former era
Dating back to forever the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law I dont govern them
I summon them speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet woodwinds strings
The conductor brings the drums in finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance Hip Hop justice rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered liars are denied water you still alive
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary patrolling the open seas at UBoat speed
Beneath the Tsunami where Im supposed to be
Industrialists civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Cosigned by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding lyrics timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it its going to have a word with me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this theres no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieris Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit whos ready
Ill need a volunteer do I have any
Next year Ill get my SPINGS a master space badge
After that Ill stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devils chamber
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The leaders lies got me reassigned my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
Im a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
Well shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like theres a bus up the street
The Dr and I would meet at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health killing myself
Rebuilding myself nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill getting more ill
The woman who is there she will take care of you
With Nexium Avodart Lipitor and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second One answer per session
Hip Hop made me Hip Hop praise me
Aint nothing changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy battle me baby
1000 Bars nigga after that maybe
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians I do it for the soldiers
Raptors Comanches Strykers Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fighting the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where we gon go
Starving in destitution dying for retribution
Why would you wanna blow a hospital You stupid
Why would you not force yourself to make better music
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot 4 ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor I see excitement coming
I raise my hand lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say were divided I say were small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
783 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
1000 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary but tell me whos the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when Im touring
Acupuncture point or plus is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute or debate
My face is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing from the other side it looks like its opening
Where am I trying to go with this
Fire and Ash fallout thats what its all about
We must construct a shelter and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
It wont happen til AFTER the official autopsy
A good psychological environment for science
Im memorizing visualizing peace and quiet
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But Im unprepared to take action just like you
The innate need for Canibus to be professional
Make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you
Greetings and salutations my equations are inundated with information
Electro cranial stimulation
Burn skin off face burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation
Any and ALL entry points have immigration
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble the effects of gravity on my
Muscles were quite subtle
I do what I want to do I have always been that way
Because I have always thinked that way
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future
Pulsating lights and sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats layered underneath lyrics
250 thousand cycles per second for Dolphin hearing
The electrical optical coupling Gear is effective
88 Kilometres above the planet
My rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding
The Gods began to call me I looked up
Stars fell towards me and scorched me to a metaphor freak
The authentic Command Doctrine of George Washington
Himself GW Im positive its him
I proof read my writtens eat a chicken with the skin missing
Spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die Now its dont vote Why
Weed is now legalized are you high
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
Be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
But not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr Iconoclast
If you dont leave the bottle outside you cant pass
Gather the evidence then give it to the President
Dont reprimand him ask him for help next 190
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I cant wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web everyday we are burying dead
Every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
Youll never reach the end of it 200
Fire and forget rhyme for respect
I didnt get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause Im familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said let it be written let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This never been done before in history
I spit at a thousand KIPS kilo tons of pressure
Every letter is measured in such a way you will remember
December 21st 2012 is the code
It was placed on the sunstone to puzzle them
Starting with some numbers the code crackers start crunching
I better have some results by the months end
Really Deep Blue computes deeply and does it
What is the answer to Universe Read me the numbers
In the summer the Polar Manitobas melted by lava
A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
The Rear Admirable participated in battle every war and at least half of my
Crew were injured every tour
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force would give us
All what we needed we were wrong
Canibus is notably known Globally
My verbal sorcery somehow talks to the beat
Lyrically you not ready dress right dress
Not messy my muscle memory make me bomb squad steady
You cant contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes ears nose throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
Recite 33 3s 33 times
For 24hrs 21 thousand Nautical miles
Ahead of my lifetime I write and recite rhymes
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth when you apply it
Devine design a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I cocreate rap 30
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets I attack it
Access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
Finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
They cant battle me so theyd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
I am still the Master
As handsome as my unborn Grandson Rip The Jacker
Call me grandpa 40 as odd as it may seem
The microphone fiend is God of the Hip Hop regime
Planet Rock Supreme
Kill you with green Lasers evaporated weed vapour Electromagnetic Scalar
Then something they call a Maser
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Meteors fall from the sky The Mars God looks at my eyes
Controlling my heart controlling my mind
Oh Lord Tell me what to do Tell me oh Lord
I have mastered the art of rhyming I am so bored
My pain my joy my thoughts Ive passed them on thru songs
Respond to me and I will answer to your call
Emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions Reality
Thats how it has to be
In front of me on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me 60
Sitting down at the mixing boardroundbanquet table comfortably
They begin to study me by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely I rose I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship pulling me with planet like inertias
Words blinking like the text edit cursor
My sentences are sometimes too sensitive to make sense of it
Layer upon layer upon layer unedited
You lazy you wanna be the best You crazy
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
Propulsion system is gravity driven white hot thermal
External vision every lyric got a wormhole in it
Saint Germaine is real Germaine is a sage for real
My sigil is the double headed eagle seal
Normal life is not real we are cogs in a wheel
We work we hurt we search we feel
The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics
Circular motion in both the para and the hyperbolas
Tiger Woods knows this everytime he plays golf he shows this
A true master at the masters in focus
In my time of need I am not alone
I was told in a dream by Cthulhu from his tomb
Try to hurt me Ill murder you lay you down vertical
Made your life purposeful germinated the earth with you
My black goggles are covered with Bat Guano
Ill hang from the ceiling and watch you act hostile Ill pop you
Rap Music and those who listen to it dont owe me nothing
I dont want nothing from you not even your judgement
The Philosophic maverick the massive knowledge magnet
Underwater sea lilies are the source of my magic
Matricidal motherfucker homicidal hustler
Filibuster never been a Wikipedia lover
If I were you I wouldnt waste time reading that rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet but fuck it
Leviathan divides the suspect zero sign
Therefore I rhyme for all time
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Unnatural battle ability the enemy tried to imprison me
But they wouldve been better off killing me
Theoretically Shiaperrelli has mentored me
With motifs of illuminated speech and wizardry
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
Sound pours out of the ground across the land
Jethro Tull was mauled by the god called Pan
Creative writing and rhythm grammar and composition
Dont ignore me ignore the fool who tells you not to listen
To you it shouldnt sound like Im quitting cause Im not
If I am to continue its up to Hip Hop
Weary of body and mind tired of swimming against the tide
Why swim or walk when I can glide
Zero Gravity exercising requires expert timing for sky diving
My call sign is Flying Wing
An impossible profession
St Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message
Now you may go
You have graduated now you may know
Tell the world exactly what you were shown
Sho nuff sesame street poems brought to you by Sears Roebuck
Countdown 48 more months
Does it amaze me NO Does it phase me maybe a little yo
Gotta find a way to generate doe
Promoter wont pay me what I want for a show
Why do it for free when Im worth my weight in gold
Mind Body Soul inseparable incredibly
Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually
Hip Hop became boring lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ
But they should be more important
The diaphragm the thymus
Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras
You get the Guantanamo Bay the Alcatraz way
You heard what I say These pigs gotta pay
I steady my approach this supposed to be a no fly zone
Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes
The hurricanes eyes open
Gale winds blowing Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean
I figured out how to save water in a drought
If we save the right amount I know we can make it out
The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy
The quantum biology biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
Even when you press rewind your still left behind
Father Author Poor Pauper breaths to draw Prana
In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama
Your ear cartilage has been targeted The bombing will commence
Dont be a bitch nigga you started it
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
Drawing mathematics suspended in space as holographics
Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style its like trying to ride a bull
The lyrical inimical is miserable because Ive built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Am I a mad man or a mason A patriot or a pagan
West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons
The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated
Im waiting on the parts special order replacements
Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment
Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites Fuck all the haters
My luck was crushed I felt like they fronted
My heart kept pumping I had to do something
I turned the page wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal XRays they say I dont burn I blaze
Dont look at it like winning or losing in 98 it was amusing
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit
Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping
But right now my image stands still in a prism
My light reflects like a mirror I choose to share it
The Precession of Earth is nearing Im preparing
Assessment and Planning things should I put mustard on these sandwiches a
Fathers job is so challenging
My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease
You cant Emcee take a seat
What are you building Bis Is it a flying Silver Disk
If you ever leave youll be missed
I tear thru the Galactic drift I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes
Now thats some shit You think thats fast Nah
Thats faster than you think By the time you blink the whole Universe shrinks
A word to the wise try to keep your eyes in the skies
And try to keep your ears on my rhymes
A magic reminder that the fire will not expire
Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when Im tired
The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt Im forced to look downward
Now I see inside the Earth
I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass
But it wont last were killing her with greenhouse gas
You said the best shouldnt have to ask for respect
Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES
I hold Hip Hop responsible
Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles
Gone til November Ill be gone forever
I made these bars so you could ALL remember
The illest MC to put it all on the line
My career was crucified but Im still alive
Sky scraper spaceships wide crater dry lake beds
resistance is futile they said
I bear clutch the pen my girlfriends jealous again
So intimate when I write its a sin 200
My electromagnetic rap flytrap
Theres no way Earth you can get around that
This is a no brainer stop the complaining
If Hip Hop is dead Im here to save it
Pages upon pages everything Ive created
The bar was below basic I had to raise it
I did it for my Fathers I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
My poetry is peaceful aggressive but regal
Progressive to the people I hope the words reach you 210
Dr Watson and Crick found an 3rd strand in the DNA helix
So your not what you think
Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum
The beat is my slave and it will behave as I want
Cheers I spill beer on my bear skin chairs
I shed tears I loved Hip Hop all these years
Poet Laureate Infinity
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
Nobody do it better there aint a truer Ripper
I did this separate imagine what we could do together
Inspired by GOD inspired by the suffering
Was it done by a prophet It must have been who was it then
Rip The Jacker hot but cold blooded
Many utter the name but very few love him
33 is the number that enlightens the Brothers
Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest
The ramifications are awesome what should we call it
I call it my unacknowledged special access project
My skull is a submarine hull
In a cave below ground with a painting of Cthulhu on the wall
Necronomicon grimoires open the doors
The vortex that reaches from here to beyond10
The power to control thoughts however remotely
Through a term Id like to call Pulse Detonation Poetry
The results from SETI very interesting
I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testing
My team was credited we turned over the evidence
But not before I could leverage it for promotion to President
Cover me 8 point sighting device for the eyes
FIRE Transition if you go dry
Close your eyes ritualize spit your rhymes
Without trying you can shift your mind
Canibus altered the sequence nucleotides
Neuropetides only get high off mature Wine
Start timing Atomic Clock keeps time perfectly 20
Mrs Guutoff my band teacher always would work me
Polyester pants big fat ass
I loved that woman so much I paid attention in class
My Spanish teacher Mrs Booker had an ass too
Why am I talking about this to you
One day this will be known for now I must wait
I still love them both and I never forget a face
At the time I used my Beta waves more than my Theta waves
Then there was greater way I learned at a later date
The rate of learning began burgeoning and wouldnt let up 30
Mommy noticed my vocabulary I developed
Telencephalon olfactory lobes I had to practice
When a woman has her period I smell it on the mattress
It got to be difficult for any woman to live with me
I know my history but what could that mean specifically
The story of Bruce Lee I died in my sleep
I was weak it happens with every girl that I meet
A Clairvoyant Technique
Using XRay refraction Not only can I see into the future
I can see past it 40
But I dont know what it means I pass the DataStream along to my team
They say its more than a dream
Killing caused by poisonous vapours Lasers Tasers Masers
Electromagnetic Scalars
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Listen to the rhymes the rhymes equal pie
If I had a piece of the pie I could buy Dubai
Rip The Jacker was born the bow was drawn
Spit a 100 bars before you could run 100 yards 50
I seen a mushroom to the north from my porch
It was odd every dog in the neighbourhood barked
You wanna stand there and talk
The blast wave gonna tear more than your roof off nigga Cmon
It is my understanding that when Im high Im channelling
But when Im out with the family I am animal handling
Observe a man who has a third DNA strand
Or a 5th or a 6th this is way more advanced
I remove the veil from in front of me suddenly
The roots of my discovery uncovered skulduggery 60
I am not innocent but you cannot punish me
Cause I know what the world wants to see tragedy
What is Germaine determined to ascertain for his self
Few of the same ilk have known what I felt
Theres a Proverb that goes One should know thyself
Before one can know the world so I showed myself
The unidentified submersible looked like a giant turtle half circle
Yo I need to stop smoking purple
Requested selected elected but thats only impressive to the experts
Who know how to manipulate my message 70
You lazy and you wanna be the best I repeat
Dont talk about consciousness when you are consciousless and weak
If I die and YOU happen to wake up Im still alive
Please explain my complete life story to my children
Photo stills of the cryospill
Solarized film revealed there was a biofield
Fuck a record deal my training is real
Look at the sword I wield you will taste my steel
Phase I sign the MOU pursue more voters
Theres three more phases that I think you should know 80
Phase II build the force Phase III sustain Ops
Phase IV transition of Border Patrol Cops
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La SiDo
These are the tones that will activate the ohms
No telling if it will bring out the best or the worst in you
It would be a miracle if I was merciful
Are you food for the moon Or are you in the mood for doom
Furniture moves when I walk into a room
STRYKER BRIGADE Driver sometimes I was GUNNER
Check points required all the concentration I could muster 90
Special Weapons And Tactics Professional Assassin
I dont know what he does for a living ask him
I kneel before Congress and beg for money
Submitting specifics about the operation Im running
You gotta love it what was it called The G8 Summit
Never heard of it no details are public
The relative radiance of the rhyme makes it shine
Increasing the star wattage with longer cycle time
Yeah I bust the rhymes but I customize the lines
And by the looks of things I did it just in time 100
I marched from the Halls of Montezuma to Tripoli
Physically this mission objective is killing me
I submit to the will of the creator willingly
The possibilities present a probable infinity
I looked into LLs eyes we both cried
Meteors immediately fell from the skies
Ive apologized but I cant change who I am
I can change future cant budge the past
Them pretty ass lyrics is for bitches with acrylic
Only fake niggas catch feelings over silly shit 110
SPORTS locked and loaded zero you in from the pillbox
Williams How many kills you got
The uniforms match so we all look the same from the sky
They only time they notice the difference is when we die
Is dying a wise thing What about trying
What about our family members back home crying
Man made weapons Star Ship Captain etc
George Lucas showed me a full size replica
We circled for a fly over in a black KIOWA
5 soldiers including me and a pilot called Noah
He passed over a top secret dossier folder half opened 120
I noticed the words MOSES and CONUS
MOSES is a new weapon system secret code
CONUS is the continent of the US I suppose
The jump light lit up Master Chief said Lets Go
All right men this is what we train for
Williams you gotta go first if you say so HALO High Altitude Stay Low
Gale Winds blowing this might be the death of me
The AIRBORNE unit in the back of me jumped out next to me
Gold chords from the organ cut down your swordsman
Tell everybody to shut the fuck up when Im talking 130
Not in current version fuel mix rich human hydrogen slush
The rhymes are too Christ Complex like for them
The 1000 Bar race at an unrelenting pace
Just in case Humans ever get to World War 8
Do you believe in fate Then how do you know
When you finally get there where will you go
This aint no joke you think Im joking
Everything frozen melted destroyed broken
Only the chosen find a way out
Everybody move out Stay off the main route 140
Satellites watch me they think they got me
Right hands turn left shoulders around but its not me
Atmospheric Reentry a flying sighting looked like lightening
Striking blind what it struck was frying
Comparative image sharpness between all artists
I dont think you know what youre about to get involved in
Ill give a quadrillion dollars to be a partner
If you are still worshipping money you are Godless
Sulphuric Nitric Acid eats through the Labyrinth
The foundation is cracking we must take action 150
Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth BIBLE
I take shelter in an old Missile Silo
Hip Hop is blackened pot placed next to a kettle
With my logo in it a rigid rehomogenized metal
Millions of you are unfamiliar with what Im saying
Discuss it with your Chemistry Professor he will praise it
Tri Quad Quintangulate where did the signal originated
Try to find out more information
The internal atheist outside the MATRIX
Sophia Stewart offered me a pill and said take this
She asked me if I was followed I told her I wasnt
I didnt know the spy that sold me out would be my own cousin
A populace uniformed is a populace of slaves
Washington didnt say it quite that way
But its something like that you get the point Im assuming
Poet Laureate Exclusive New Shit
The message said We should meet somewhere clandestine
Professor keep heading East to the Best Western
Do not loose your bearings keep checking your direction
Start Session point 666 arc seconds
The budget is huge I have doubts about spending it
Concerning Cyclotronic Resonance patents are pending it
Canibus aka The Spitzberg Beast
Gave his Bicentennial Speech on Emerald Peak
Youll need a first aid kit for the verse I spit
I am cautiously meticulous but artfully brisk
A change is beginning every molecule is spinning
Lyrics imitate the art art imitates lyrics can you hear it
Signals bounce back and forth like a mirror
With flawless error like that forever
Surface the air radar tells me where they are 180
Are they far I patiently watch the sweep arm
We can find them but they cant find us
Just below Mach 3 the rhymes ionizes
Im hooked on Hip Hop I cant live without it
You can mix this song a thousand ways I dont doubt it
The daughters of man locked in prison camps
With the sons of mothers that are too weak to dance
At least we notice damage what do we expect
The coming super storm is gonna wipe us off the map 190
But that is not possible thats sounds completely illogical
You mustve been kicked the fuck out of school
Always remember the Reptilian agenda
No Pulse Rendered in the earthquakes epicentre
I found fluoride in my water supply
At the time I felt a total apathy towards dying
The ungrateful dead reoccurring images playing in my head
I was told to memorize what I was said
With this salt I consecrate this water
May whatever it touch receive Hallowed LIGHT from THEM
With this sacred water I consecrate this Talisman so that
It will make ME POET LAUREATE otherwise Ill be so depressed oh well no
Regrets I been toe to toe with the best I KNOW the LEDGE
I accept all cultures colours creeds and races
Life is Life no taxonomical classification
No corruption no disruption no destruction no budget no nothing
Its never that easy you just gotta trust it
A leader I feel beleaguered to teach the truth
The Youth will refuse to follow if they dont believe you
There is strength in numbers there are numbers in strength
Nothing good comes from hatred Loves the missing link
Even if I am in a minority of one
The truth is still the truth no matter how its spun
My mind is prepared Hip Hop is impaired
If you disagree with me then yours isnt there
I rock rhymes for your pleasure you listen at your leisure
I only record it once you listen to it forever
The fish hook stuck in your jaws the feedback was not positive
Human Hominids fishing for compliments
Started with a nugget the budget snowballed into something
Above ground running not underground covered
Breath easy regulate the pace see if they love it
The Poet Laureate puppet with a message from THE OTHERS
The aura describes the forces
Im too involved to divorce it my internal compass points me northward
My skull is a submarine hull calling whales with whale song
Creating basketball size hailstorms
Water World under water war protected by the Jericho wall
With surface permutation of the permafrost
My war birds are grounded their wings have been burned off
Im not concerned though its only the first lost
Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry
Poet Laureate infinity now you know its me
Yeti riding a Triceratops with Elephant netting
Attending Black Widow weddings dressing in gossamer webbing
Pretending experimenting they call me a heretic
A derelict cherubim seraphim protecting America
Height weight eye colour skeletal structure was designed
I circle my flight instructors in the skies as they fly
22 times to show them I have plenty new rhymes
Poet Laureate will prove it to you all in due time
Dont be upset with Canibus yet the kid just want respect
You been a success but what do he get
Politics and Perjury bring out the worst in me
But I dont take it personally even though its hurting me
The key maker turns the key those observing me keep cursing me
They arent worthy of a word from me
I spit the truth Rip the mic Rip the booth Rip you too
Rip the Jacker is proof I Ripped through
It drives me insane when a woman wears lace
The current gene structure is 46 pair based
Her heart rumbling and thundering like Captain Nicole Malachowski from an
Airbase on a clear day
Ok Im a pervert Its time to fess up
I might be looking for a leg up but I wont touch
Closet sadomasochist sexual pacifist
I like to role play but I only play masculine
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
Im a giant in the industry just over 5 ft
Even my photo ID dont look like me
The NASA contractor with a satchel of answers
I passed up the Nobel Peace Prize for my passion
Democracy Rules Everything Around Me DREAM
Another fucking acronym just what I need
Killing me with phrases that were designed to put me into dazes
As worthless as my junk mail is
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The Squid Faced God is difficult to describe
Those of weak heart and mind shouldnt even try
In a town near Kadam and Kakrak Jahlalabad
I pray in a hut constructed from Sago Palm
Astoria Oregon Fisherman Poets got lost
Looking for Paradise it only exists in the heart
Cause emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions and Reality
But what is attracting me
The overseer of poetic antiquity
The Victoria and Albert Museum kept them for me
Pythagoras Dionysus Loki and Pan
They have enlightened me thru song to understand
The multiplex meshing multiple messages is too much for me
Truly there is too much to see
Ill mix one for you then one for me
Ill mix some for the street mix til my thumbs bleed
A stationary pulley drawing from a wishing well
The Genie gave me more than three because I listen well
Conflicted and confused but completely compelled
To celebrate my birthday alone in the year 2012
I hope I am not alone that would be terrible
If I am celebrating then that would be a miracle
In a newly ordered world living in shit
No matter how good or poor your English is
You lazy and you wanna be the best You crazy
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
Ermaine Will I am the name that my precious mother gave me
The world came to know me as Sir William
The man of steel with a Smallville build with the illest
Some of my thoughts align with Einstein himself
I wanna know Gods thoughts too the rest are details
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course but
The secret to creativity is hiding your sources
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
Do not blame them and hold their humanity hostage
Pray for the families that want them home
Pray for the families abroad that have lost their homes
Who have lost their faith who have lost their hope
Who have lost their point who have lost their own
Yo calm the fuck down I shouldnt have to curse at you
Hydrate as much as possible drink a lot of juice
Fucking bummer no armour inside the Hummer
Gotta hug a motherfucking sandbag for cover
Now Im self employed still gotta pay taxes
Cashless bankrupt aint got no assets
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
Cause I dont want it thats why Im rarely seen in public
President Poetry the popular obedient Pundit
Thats right you can take this job and shove it
I dictate a scribe that causes the court stenographer to die
Brewing hot tea with honey and lime
How is my driving Run you off the road smiling
1800RoadRage Start dialing
The snake will grow feet and stampede you to your defeat
You are weak you lied to us all in your speech
Symbiotic indeed the host bleeds
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Rock climbed the slope shaped like a stop sign
In record clock time Hot Lava lock rhymes rock slide topside
How does one ever really perfect such a craft
Youre obliged by your curiosity to ask
Cubism and Futurism writing amusing lyrics
My opinion of your opinion is you cant be serious
Test driving my principle findings
By designing a new style of rhyming you can take home and try out
A 100 Bars per hour sometimes I doubled the writing secret signature timing
Was the hardest part to figure out
Agonizing the pain of the migraine biting my brain
And everything inside it I cant explain but Im trying
I heard this before I cant remember who said it
We hear from 1000 to 20 thousand cycles per second
Straight out the freak show no preshow
Limited oxygen when I rhyme fast you breath slow
VFR stands for Visual Flight Rules by the Book
You should know this even though it concern the showbiz
Because when in Rome walk as a Roman
Obviously you can see youve made the wrong choice
Fraternize but dont do it in the wrong tone of voice
A bad boy with bad toys made from new alloys
Readapted from a crashed asteroid
My shelter is not far you can borrow what you need
The bunker doors sequestered beneath the tall tumble weeds
After the Matrix Agent Smith continued his movement
The same bullshit that humans are major pollutants
Assemble the Gatlin gun spin it see if it spun
Weapons check correct Im done next one
My rap room is an 8 by 14 underground base
Hyper cube microphone booth in a vacuum of space
Extraterrestrial Isotopic ratios
A broke Scientist in his Lab with no place to go
All these conscious rappers aint saying nothing
Matter fact they have no constituent function
Mix this record different youll hear me call names out
Its played out but there must be alternative routes
The Geneva Protocol Advocates are so sloppy
A human being is not anybodys property
Reading body language in a Zero Gravity environment
Is much easier said than done if your trying it
Attending the Opera with a Pompous Ego Monster
I can barely take my eyes off her big old knockers
Integrated in an existing clothing ensemble
My Saratoga Suit is Military Garment
The Quarantine Isolation Unit is where I house it
My team and I salvage the work of Dr Fritz Albert
If the prototype works theres no telling what I will do
Ill have to get a new Plane a new Pilot and a Crew
Creatively I have never been to this level
First Ill put you in a sideways 8 then a pretzel
Password please have patience verification
I repeat Whats Your Character String Verification
Infrared spectral observation from the Space Station
Before you take a break Ill need you to list and name them
Dock the Kliper Craft at the preliminary designation
Tracing the Detection of Submicron Radiation
Do not leave the Orbital Boom Sensor System running
I heard something called nothing that the Cosmonauts were coming
The rhymes are in place General George Case
And Peter Pace said we had absolutely no time to waste
Next time we meet this whole song will be a new mix
For all the Rippers out there who need a new fix
My father is Jamaican my mother is British
Raised to be civic in the household we spoke Yiddish
ELF 100 cps Elephant Hearing
Im heading for the clearing Storm Clouds appearing
On the back of an Elephant with advanced intelligence
Like Nikola Tesla shit damn thats a smart Elephant
Cease fire breach riot and loot for 3 weeks dont you see
Broke niggas never promote peace
Suzanne Malveaux will interview the polygamist Mr Bis
Undisclosed in his home by the cliffs
I rip shit consistent spit persistent
The sickness spit with conviction promote lyrical fitness
Im lost what version is this
Mozart with a flowchart putting together parts of an unknown art
But coming from my own heart
Burning a disk initializing rhyming and visualizing
Reaching 1000 Bars and climbing
Martial Law Research an all expense paid trip to the dirt
Several miles deep underneath the Earth
The Boston Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
Extraordinary men who meet to review and recommend
I attend the Gubernatorial that never ends 190
We just got a SASO we call this one the Black Hole
Im glad Im the last to go
Zionism the answer to your uncensored question
Guy de Rothschild and his bloodline brethren
Playing the guitar singing folk songs speaking my mind
Nobody could really understand the reason I rhyme
Infrared direct hit target bled proceed to inject the syringe with meds
That subsequently pinch your leg
You feel like your an inch from being dead
But you alive instead youre really dead your just living in my head
Fire for effect smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation roll out like this
I will spare no sin walk in with a scarecrow grin looking crazy
Cause thats what you made me
Classified payloads with no frequency safe modes no safety
And I still made time for the ladies
Ceiling visibility unlimited
A lyricist river fish surrounded by nigga shrimp
Im a killer pimp
Somebody Hip Hop dont need me
Nigga I grew up in DC I love Lil Weezy 210
Me and Baby got the same name
We probably got the same blood in our veins liquid propane
At the top of the Temple Mount Mosque I look at the Sun
I just have a few words for everyone
Everybody bow your heads and say this prayer
From this moment Hip Hop is united everywhere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
",you it shouldnt sound like Im quitting cause Im not If I am to continue its up to Hip Hop Weary of body and mind tired of swimming against the tide Why swim or walk when I can glide Zero Gravity exercising requires expert timing for sky diving My call sign is Flying Wing An impossible profession St Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message Now you may go You have

little yo Gotta find a way to generate doe Promoter wont pay me what I want for a show Why do it for free when Im worth my weight in gold Mind Body Soul inseparable incredibly Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually Hip Hop became boring lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ But they should be more important The diaphragm the thymus Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras You get the Guantanamo Bay the Alcatraz way You heard what I say These pigs gotta pay I steady my approach this supposed to be a no fly zone Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes The hurricanes eyes open Gale winds blowing Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean I figured out how to save water in a drought If we save the right amount I know we can make it out The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy The quantum biology biopsy My austere designs are so ahead of their time Even when you press rewind your still left behind Father Author Poor Pauper breaths to draw Prana In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama Your ear cartilage has been targeted The bombing will commence Dont be a bitch nigga you started it On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet Drawing mathematics suspended in space as holographics Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal Viable style its like trying to ride a bull The lyrical inimical is miserable because Ive built a citadel Of syllables that made me invincible Am I a mad man or a mason A patriot or a pagan West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated Im waiting on the parts special order replacements Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites Fuck all the haters My luck was crushed I felt like they fronted My heart kept pumping I had to do something I turned the page wrote a turn of phrase Verbal XRays they say I dont burn I blaze Dont look at it like winning or losing in 98 it was amusing But Poet Laureate is my New Shit Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping But right now my image stands still in a prism My light reflects like a mirror I choose to share it The Precession of Earth is nearing Im preparing Assessment and Planning things should I put mustard on these sandwiches a Fathers job is so challenging My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease You cant Emcee take a seat What are you building Bis Is it a flying Silver Disk If you ever leave youll be missed I tear thru the Galactic drift I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes Now thats some shit You think thats fast Nah Thats faster than you think By the time you blink the whole Universe shrinks A word to the wise try to keep your eyes in the skies And try to keep your ears on my rhymes A magic reminder that the fire will not expire Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when Im tired The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt Im forced to look downward Now I see inside the Earth I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass But it wont last were killing her with greenhouse gas You said the best shouldnt have to ask for respect Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES I hold Hip Hop responsible Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles Gone til November Ill be gone forever I made these bars so you could ALL remember The illest MC to put it all on the line My career was crucified but Im still alive Sky scraper spaceships wide crater dry lake beds resistance is futile they said I bear clutch the pen my girlfriends jealous again So intimate when I write its a sin 200 My electromagnetic rap flytrap Theres no way Earth you can get around that This is a no brainer stop the complaining If Hip Hop is dead Im here to save it Pages upon pages everything Ive created The bar was below basic I had to raise it I did it for my Fathers I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers I did it for the world to discover My poetry is peaceful aggressive but regal Progressive to the people I hope the words reach you 210 Dr Watson and Crick found an 3rd strand in the DNA helix So your not what you think Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum The beat is my slave and it will behave as

Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest The ramifications are awesome what should we call it I call it my unacknowledged special access project My skull is a submarine hull In a cave below ground with a painting of Cthulhu on the wall Necronomicon grimoires open the doors The vortex that reaches from here to beyond10 The power to control thoughts however remotely Through a term Id like to call Pulse Detonation Poetry The results from SETI very interesting I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testing My team was credited we turned over the evidence But not before I

wouldnt let up 30 Mommy noticed my vocabulary I developed Telencephalon olfactory lobes I had to practice When a woman has her period I smell it on the mattress It got to be difficult for any woman to live with me I know my history but what could that mean specifically The story of Bruce Lee I died in my sleep I was weak it happens with every girl that I meet A Clairvoyant Technique Using XRay refraction Not only can I see into the future I can see past it 40 But I dont know what it means I pass the DataStream along to my team They say its more than a dream Killing caused by poisonous vapours Lasers Tasers Masers Electromagnetic Scalars That is not dead which can eternally lie And with strange aeons even death may die Listen to the rhymes the rhymes equal pie If I had a piece of the pie I could buy Dubai Rip The Jacker was born the bow was drawn Spit a 100 bars before you could run 100 yards 50 I seen a mushroom to the north from my porch It was odd every dog in the neighbourhood barked You wanna stand there and talk The blast wave gonna tear more than your roof off nigga Cmon It is my understanding that when Im high Im channelling But when Im out with the family I am animal handling Observe a man who has a third DNA strand Or a 5th or a 6th this is way more advanced I remove the veil from in front of me suddenly The roots of my discovery uncovered skulduggery 60 I am not innocent but you cannot punish me Cause I know what the world wants to see tragedy What is Germaine determined to ascertain for his self Few of the same ilk have known what I felt Theres a Proverb that goes One should know thyself Before one can know the world so I showed myself The unidentified submersible looked like a giant turtle half circle Yo I need to stop smoking purple

7735,"Mom I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and Im fucked up
And Mom I know hes not around
But dont you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink yeah
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst never thinkin about who what I said hurt
In what verse my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did I take it too far
Cleanin Out My Closet and all them other songs
But regardless I dont hate you cause Ma
Youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree dont mean shit to me
Youre kickin me out Its fifteen degrees
And its Christmas Eve Little prick just leave
Ma let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each others goats
Why we always at each others throats
Especially when Dad he fucked us both
Were in the same fuckin boat
Youd think thatd make us close Nope 
Further away it drove us but together headlights shine
And a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
Back to grandmas house its straight up the road
And I was the man of the house the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eightyearsold
And thats when I realized you were sick
And it wasnt fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though but
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But Im sorry Mama for Cleanin Out My Closet
At the time I was angry rightfully Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause now I know its not your fault and Im not makin jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time its on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medications takin over
And your mental states deterioratin slow
And Im way too old to cry this shit is painful though
But Ma I forgive you so does Nathan yo
All you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
Foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers
Oh what a tangled web we have cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
But Ida flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa kidnap em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin to get some hamburgers
Me her and Nate we introduced you hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And Im mad I didnt get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So Mom please accept this as a
Tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to
Get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to
Lay it fore Im dead the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt I guess were crashin
So if Im not dreamin I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar cause youre my mom
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life Start over 
One without a cause Clean slate 
So Im coming home tonight Yeah 
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew cant wake me up
Well just know that Im alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh even if theres songs to sing
Well my children will carry me
Just know that Im alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So Ill never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that Im alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life

Grammar like a hammer information receivable
Sent by the Lord here and abroad
With words well adored now they cant be ignored
ForForForForce of course that makes Run the boss
So get lost because I just toss a punk
Make way today and if I may I say
I make pay with Jay so get away OKAY
Gainin weight I ate the whole plate to date
Never rate the great I go state to state
Just peep and keep but dont sleep or weep
Get deep to leap or Ill beep the Jeep
Put down the clown get round the town
I found the sound and Ill pound the ground
Get paid and laid not jayed or fraid
So I stayed and made not a bad debate
Got a group to troop with a shoop de shoop
Shoot hoop then scoop on this loop to loop
Goin off and on not soft of course
Just black and back to go back and forth
Go to school and cool not drool or pool
Got soul and gold and cold hold a jewel
Upset the best I met met a jest
Just lest the pest and I am the best
Got a punch to crunch cold munch for lunch
Not Grady or the lady from the Brady Bunch
Got Gs and Lees like Ds and Ts
Charge Bs to freeze all MCs with ease
No dope to cope just good to go
Theres hope to Pope big nope for nope
Quite clever and never were together forever
RunDMC and were Tougher Than Leather
guitar solo
Strong and mighty hard as can be
The perception of the life were as strong as D
Never frightened Im writin writin for whats right
Not schemin thievin in the night Im keepin with my mic
I got to go for broke and I aint no joke
I wont yoke and choke cept the suckers I smoked
Bumrush and crush leave em in the dust
I choose to bust the bust the scums who mess with us
Only strong survive and the weak will die
As long as Im alive I keep my head up high
Because Im strong in body and smart in mind
I was born to rhyme as a gift to mankind
No punk or chump never givin no slack
Well be killin a villain and like chillin Yo black
Im not a bum Im not dumb its me you run from
Im the king I do my things until my Kingdom Come
guitar solo
Cause Im
Rough and tough cold huff and puff
Dont bluff the stuff got enough to muff
Go long and on no longer song
Go on and on just for past the dawn
Put preach and teach with a speech to reach
All streets and each with beats for treats
Got the King Supreme may seem the clean
With a beat and a ring no dream machine
Not a gang to bang out to hang with slang
Talking yang and tang about everythang
Just brothers and others like fathers and mothers
Who discovered they love us that think theyre up and above us
No crime or time just rhyme and Im
Full grown and own no phone or dime
Just cut the stuff til you get enough
Cause were rougher than tougher and rougher tougher than tough
guitar solo
Ah with a voice like thunder words of wonder
Over all standin tall and the suckers fall under
Posessed with power cowards will cower
Ducks we devour hour hour after hour
Three man riot you cant deny it
Were so ill that you cant defy it
Gonna live POSITIVE forever AND EVER

I said think of your future
You cant do that tomorrow
But you dont hear a word you see that SLR
O ye tormented souls
My goal is to sit on the globe like North Poles
And thats the top mang going hammer like a Glock cant
All flow and grammar no shot drank
Im so sober when I speak
I call it catching bullets with my teeth
You can feel it in your chest
Like Bruce Lee jumping on your vest
But I cant feel yours through my Superman S
Yes Im Supermandout
Rare Cartier look like Superman house
Inshallah to my plan hope it super pans out
My life is like Italia doin 100 miles
And the top open like the roofer ran outta tiles
Walk right into Philippes when I ran outta Chows
Next up is crustaceans and fast food halals
The beef is all the same its just how they kill the cows
Somebody tell Malcolm X that Im tryna steal his style
And tell Cornel West that Im tryna steal his fro
Go back in time take the slaves plows shovels and the hoes
The masters get the It Was Written intro
SLR 104
SLR 104
Soundtrakk let the beat go
Soundtrakk let the beat roll
In this world Im so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you cant tell me what you gon do
Cause nigga I dont believe that
Like 911 came from Iraq
Mayweather on the speedbag
Automatic weapons keep the same rhythm he has
Thats how the hood sound
Grew up in the hood town
West side ghetto Windy City Cook Count
Black skies lookin up crack pipes lookin down
Accused of not lookin back blind nigga look around
City on my back so the CHI go errywhere Im at
Presence so shiny Mercedes so matte
Cop that from Platinum the color of my plaque
I memorize Colors off of Yo MTV Raps
A nightmare walking in a psychopaths nap
Defeat your purpose like a weed stash in the rehab
Guess whos sneaking in the weed bags
That be me with my me ass
Not tryna be anything but free as
Flow is so nuts the track is gettin teabagged
Just wanna rap nice that aint me tag
If you wanna be mean then you wanna be me bad
Call it being Pretty Lyrically Swag
Soulja call it Super Lupe Lyrical
You cant understand me nor mimic my miracles
All I see is me and Im a mother lovin mirrorfull
Bein dope is all in the muscle
Its more than just a pause and a chuckle
I bench press elephants and bowlin ball juggle
So dont be scared to take the Super Lu route
Top 5 alive and I only got 2 out
School ya on your history I tell ya what you bout
Fight for all the right things and let the Huey New out
Pharrell what these niggas talkin bout
2 man Big Pun a 1 man Slaughterhouse
A 2 album JayZ a 1 nigga WuTang
Young and hungry Mos Def a conscious rappin Lil Wayne
I dont care for similarities
Cause Im a pioneer not a parody
These aint bars this is barbarity
SLR Clarity
In this world Im so alone
In a category all on my own
Cause I tell the world what I want to
Yea I tell the world what I want to
Man I feel so alone
They treat me like an outcast
Cause I tell the world what I want to
But you cant tell me what you gon do
Holy Shock and awing cattle prods
All up in the action with a fraction of the catalogue
Of my peers I aint doin numbers like Anbesol
But Im here and Im revered
Lyric boy Based King Master Chef All City Chess moves Mickey Donny Diggy CRS fool
Carrera Era Panamera FTool Emperor Free Chilly nigga FNF RULES
Ye what these niggas talkin bout
A Jesus in the desert walking Dundee walkabout
A self imposed exile learn to let the awesome out
Even if I was homeless I would still have an awesome house
Cause the world is mine Lupe to the rescue the world is fine
Words and lines of mine I feel are better than every rap in the world combined
And thats how you do it
Erything flow errything fluid
Stupid with the raps but the raps never stupid
Trakk on the music SLR ruthless
And the next whip is that Ferrari cart
Game over body parts

Running blind through killing fields bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be a servant til I fall
Soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
Twentyone only son but he served us well
Bred to kill not to care do just as we say
Finished here greeting death hes yours to take away

You will do what I say when I say

You will die when I say you must die

Barking of machinegun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks get used to it somehow
More a man more stripes you wear glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see the slaughter never ends
Soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
Twentyone only son but he served us well
Bred to kill not to care do just as we say
Finished here greeting death hes yours to take away

Why am I dying

Lie live off lying

I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself molded day by day
Looking back I realize nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend alone I clench my gun

Out in the streets blindfolded
Not knowin whats really goin on
Nawimsayin
These streets is a habitat baby
Word up

In the garden of snakes aint no breaks no mistakes
Just games thats played at high stakes the next guys wake
Try to fly straight not violate if you wanna die late
The tristate crime at a high rate where peoples dilate
Gun shots that make the block vibrate it shook niggas migrate
Some die by fate yo niggas cry hate
A fly facer get they thighs scraped
And little PUS thats why raped
A kid inside his gate gets murdered by jake
A young nigga try ta fly capes and get caught on the FBI tape
In verse of the State
Lost the case and gotta fry date
Ninety ninety eight day of July eighth
Some cats get ta stack the hot papes
Live in the skyscrapes
Go ta airline buy flyin states
Where they can hibernate and operate
Impregnate some chinkyeyed mate
Other niggas will lay the power race wit tre 8s
Try to apply weight and ready ta die staced off and dehydrate
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down

Keep your mind calm your nine on me hard ta find harm
Peep the crime dons rollin wit excons holdin they out rons
And teflons ta be streets flooded wit red ponds
Like it was red dawn bodies get found around without the heads on
Judges set bonds that figures they know niggas is dead on
Whats left of death penalty facilities where niggas step on
Wit those that blew trough go get they body filled wit electrons
The tec drawns the ones that live foul theyre leavin wet moms
Wit lead charms put her ta bed wit her head drawn
Killas wit red palms leavin bodies cool as the dead fonz
Caught in the dead wrong found they way ran into the feds arms

And broken glass globes the dip chicks slicker than gastro
Who bag a slash blow and spot some top of the block hot as a gas stove

Yeah Sound your horn boy
You see
Dem want to kill de youths
Kill de youths and Kings
Dead first at eleven
Never tell de youths that Pokemon be the settin
Never tell de youths
Send down to earth be the endin
Now look what I did
Mashin Up Da Earth
Ghetto youths they wanna destroy
But what peace must sanctify we if they use them guns for toys
Do you ever spend a night in an Upstate prison before
Not to mention Rikers Island to see dem youths dem sleepin on the floor
Check the cycle God ended
Whats the fate of this planet
Black on black love and hates got my people frantic
Peep the criminal mind
The subliminal line
Such difficult times
Automatic pistols and Glock nines
I wish I could stop time
For the cat who drop dime
Thinkin about his lifeline
A young man told me that my wise words saved his life
It made me feel good
Made me feel real good
Back in the day I used to steal goods
Dreams without means is like a lack of selfesteem or lack of CREAM
I go for delf or roll out for the team
Chorus 2X
Line 1 only
Feel the pain of the ghetto through a teardrop
My peers stop and listen from eighteen years
Muslim and Christian We all face conviction
In this moment of oppression The world is like infection
On this block we confessin
I use my mind as a weapon
Like I told my brothers Glock and Snub
Aint No HalfSteppin We gotta live Heaven
And watch our seeds taste the blessin
I learned my lesson bout havin snakes around my crew
Now I know the evil that men do and bitches too
We had thought by our riches
Some called thugs and snitches
Through the different timeframes
Kid I watched crime change
In the time of fame
My man is like crackcocaine
But through the black rain I seen many suffer in pain
We go for gain and pain
Now they rock some fat gold chains
Icedout name perform a concert sellin out in Maine
Own the properties and all types of things
Some say the drug game and the music game is all the same
Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry Oohoohooh
We can no longer put all the blame on the man
For those sellin out Im sayin Shame on the man
For those fallin victim Im sayin Make a new plan
And for those that need a way Im sayin Take my hand
See this mental slavery causes rash behavior G
And I have to say for me that I wish it would all stop
Before we become extinct before we all drop
And RIP to the rappers thats been slain
And RIP to the fine young men whove lost their lives
I feel the pain
And do you know what its like to lose a loved one
It makes you numb
Especially when its over somethin small but aint no fun
I lose four friends in one year I could feel
Them watchin over me see their faces still
Some clear and some fear whats out there
For me I have no time to and may I remind you
This is a corrupted world of our design du
Peep my discussion no one can changes these things but us son
We didnt ask for the liquor crack and guns
We didnt ask for the poor eduction and lack of funds
But I know one thing none of us wanna die
But still were Mashin Up this World and I dont know why
Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry Oohoohooh
Mom and Dad wipe the tears from ya eyes
Ooh Pray for the youths
Said me nah gon cry Oohoohooh
Oohoohooh Riot in the prison
Rikers Island
When a gust of GPE Babylon will stand to see
So the sentence cant be free

To survive is only half the battle we wont lose it
So have faith in better days on the way
I lend my hand to you whenever you need me Ill stay
I understand sometimes the world is type cloudy
But like a plane thats over the game we fly out it
Determination dedication til the end
Im there every step of the way until we win
Cause I believe in prayer in God Almighty
Get them burdens off your shoulder send them to the highest
But we can beat it overcome the lows
Being positive is key you believe and it shows
I spread awareness be mindful of your health
Be here for one another so you never by yourself
One step at a time one time for the cause
I rep it for the world I rap it for us all
Dont run away from who you are

Pick yourself back on up
Lifes beautiful life is so beautiful 
This the highway of life we stay driven
Then at some point you arrive at a decision

Taking stale pictures see the crystals forming
The horns make me feel victorious the keys make me feel glorious
The drums make me feel like a warrior
The track feel big Notorious
Do it for the people feeling trapped in the corridor
Nobody know what youre going through in a day
But dont let yesterday ruin today
And they say
They say its all for the money but I dont wan believe it
Im a man of my word so whatever you been hearing
Is the truth flatline polygraph thats me
We could all use a break spare of Apache
Catch me crossing items off my bucket list
Cause life is good as you want it to get
I paint a different portrait with any color I find
The canvas is the world and the brush is my mind
I dont mind stepping out my comfort zone
I think the greatest fear is the one of the unknown
If you afraid of living and you afraid of death
Then Im afraid youll never take a step to the left
Or the right direction
Tonights confession I used to be scared of my own reflection
And what would really happen if I fought that vision
But the matter all along if its not good its gone

2055,"From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
Im travellin on far and wide
But now it seems
Im just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isnt me but someone else
I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Aint it funny how it is
You never miss it til its gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be til my dying day
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realize youre living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Cant ease this pain so easily
When you cant find the words to say

4915,"I burn my bridges with a blow torch
A rebel born from verbal holocaust
Dirty and never try to cleanse to get the drama off
Swiftest stealth assassin snipe you from balcony shots
A terrorist position professional from the opera box
Rhyme documents infamous like the Bill of Rights
Illa tight havin niggas open like the thrill of dykes
Jean Grae Yakuza mass murderer
Friends who got the dirt on her
Foes who never heard of her
Wild Style my mouth bomb the train up
I spit Krylon in five colors when I speak I spray my name up
Split your wig up like Denny Bruce
Splash your remains and brains out
On the street like Henny and juice
Noose your neck and loosen your spine from back
Shift your spleen rip til its just obscene
From downtown swingin it New York illest who rip it
Ever flow like a river fuck your girl like a nigga what
Ive been through hell and back scars swell on my back
I spit bars yall spit repetitive raps
Im a street dude who decided to rhyme with lines thatll crack the disc between your mind and your spine
Thats why yall wanna bite my design
And thats why usually I hold the mic like a 9
Pistolwhip you on the side of your eye watch it pop out
We knock out cats and wipe the floors with their rocks out
Shocked now Like you drivin in a lightning storm
With the top down we got this locked down
Like convicts on the run gettin shot down for phone time
We gainin yards in the whole nine
See me and Tech we steadily building
And we about to blow like the Oklahoma Federal Building
And all them niggas get mad when we step in the building Cause we make the crowd jump
And hit they head on the ceiling what
I spit heat like the deserts of Saudi Arabia
Bury competition like Mesopotamia
Emanatin radiation pissin liquid uranium
I bring the rock like European drunks in soccer stadiums
Ill split your cranium with perfect symmetry lyrically
If youre not the illest then you dont deserve to spit with me
OBSobliterating bastards sacrilegiously
I sacrifice niggas who talk shit ritualistically
Meticulously makin all my rivals suicidal
Like white suburban kids on acid readin the Satanic Bible
My arrival is genocidal like Christopher Columbus
Exterminatin races of wack MCs that walk among us
Ive just begun to bust Ill make this place open candela
These racist cops wanna lock me longer then Nelson Mandela
Pissed off Im makin hella paper East to West Coast
And I treat the law in this country like a motherfuckin joke
Cause if Im willin to smoke the President
While hes sniffin his coke
You know it dont mean shit to me to cut a fuckin cops throat

Im just cut from a different cloth
And they dont make this fabric no more
That money coming Im grabbin it all
Triple beam leaning still balancing raw
Still got the white Macklemore
Car seat smelling like I just ripped the packing off
Run down on me in traffic Im backin em off
Sex money and murder mastered it all
Shout out to my macs but Im Billy though
Still on that gangland shit really though
Got a couple locs that Im close with
And theyll Shmurda dance on your whole shit
Free Bobby free Rowdy free the whole 9
Free Duski free Chewie free my old Ys
Act up we at your neck like bowties
Belly shit bringing niggas gifts in a whole 9
Might send your woman crush on a road trip
That pussy stuffed with a whole brick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
Buy it by the pounds smoking by the zip
Buy em by the rounds shoot em by the clip
Everybody down everybody hit
I said everybody down everybody hit
Nowadays the game full of lames and straight gays
Niggas throwing shade and hate from a fake page
Niggas catfishing for asswhippings
Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death blood on this Raf Simons
Fiends like Santana where you at with it
Back like cooked crack yall done gave too many bad fixes
Looking at my Rollie its bout that time yo
Extended clip have your whip jumping like pot holes
Yeah Im the main event you the side show
Times up mine go hit em with the Young MA flow 
I think these niggas think I lost my mojo
No I think its time I let these niggas know so

Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all this hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
Pop the locks on the Benz steal his keys
Too high to see his own enemies
Seen his baby mama tears with a short skirt
His last ride was in a car I mean a black hearse
His friend took his life for the mighty dollar
Then ran through the alley mustve been a coward
No more hit em up like in the old days
Homies ride with Mack 10s and AKs
Thats why I roll by myself I mean alone
Cause haters be all up on
Tryna sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
And the same niggas wanna blow on your weed
Set you up for a caper
Dont wanna see you make no money then take ya

And they get mad over the things you have and the things theyll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really aint hard to get
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors Im really not impressed
I tell you only one time with my scrilla fool dont mess

Nonpackers Im strapped like P or C
Just in case these niggas after me capture me

Dont hate me nigga and go head and credit my dippin

And Imma try to make yall kill me in a matter of lines
I got friends that can turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me
When I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes upon my enemies I gotta watch my friends
Like when Im sittin on top or ridin a Benz
Why dont yall go out yalls ass up and get somethin
Dont worry about how I got mines
Always tryin to point a finger and say thats not mine
And kill me
It kills me
Its disgusting cause I got a few Gs
They try to rob me
But the white manll make it they wont touch em
Smile in your face and talk shit behind your back

Well go head and leave
The call heard around the world from the wives of MCs
These cats is payin more than half a pound
My garment bagll snatch it down
Aint got the skate but we can probably run it back in town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern MC ie the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhymin no different from coal minin
We both on assignments to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin then them eyes start shinin
You be strugglin and strivin and they think you primetimin
Maintain and keep silent make note and observation
This confrontation this is the daily operation
My concentration stay focused on my recitation
Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation cause this aint no recreation
This is proball
And we lettin you know yall
At the show yall
Doin this for dough yall
Get the phone call
And Im ready to blow yall
Bout to go yall
Been a pleasure to know yall

To drop these heavyass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalogue of rap songs
My baby girl is walkin been away for that long
But no you havent
Well at least thats how it seem to me
My hometown is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leanin leisurely
The new jacks up in the parks smokin greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it
But its sweet scented when you been down for a minute
Move around city limits break it down with the vintage
The inovinin classical bboy image
Collect the winnings cause it the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cackalacks
Cali and the Cadillacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia state
DC make me stimulate

If youve got the money to pay me in gold
I will be living in old Monte Carlo
And you will be reading the secrets I sold
Daggers and contacts and bright shiny limos
Ive got a watch that turns into a lifeboat
Glimmering nightgowns poisonous as cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe
The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
Shed rather shoot me in my tracks
And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash halo of flies
I crossed the ocean where no one would see
And I put a timebomb in your submarine
Goodbye to old friends the secrets in hand
With phonied up papers and counterfeit plans
You never will understand

Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip Yo
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how Everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over blaow
Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope
There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go Go 
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms
Close to postmortem it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter he blows its all over
These hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads
God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes dont want him no more hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
Is told it unfolds I suppose its old partner
But the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah

No more games Ima change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebodys payin the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my nineto
Five and I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And theres no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its gettin even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
Caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotonys
Gotten me to the point Im like a snail Ive got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got
To go I cannot grow old in Salems Lot
So here I go its my shot feet fail me not

7750,"Its five oclock Im just getting home
Roaming on my own
What can I tell her
That she might understand
The soundtrack to my life is like CNN first shit
Images like CNN but worse shit
I would down the whole Pinot Gris
But Id see the group home without the Primo beats
And it hurts my soul
Im a warrior so though the odds is against a nigga Dirk gon choke
Some people confide in the person that they sleep with
Ive learned theres no such thing as a secret oh 
I cant describe the feeling I get
You was riding shotgun I was wheeling the whip
Shit I even let you rock out being Bill Belichick
Tapin from the sidelines stealin my shit
But dawg you was like a mini me mocked me envied me
Turns out you was blowin hot air Kenny G
But you was cool accepted you instantly
Not a groupie but you had a few tendencies
And though we share a few memories
Couple wrong turnsll turn a friend to an enemy
See phony people like phony people
Even you could be mistaken if you phone these people look
When you invite the nerds to the cool table
Shit is bound to break up like a pool table
So wack dudesll start feeling like the shit
And you thinkin its you its really where you sit
Or maybe you was neglected
Cause when you take the front down and strip a nigga naked hes dying to be accepted oh 
I did that just the way you was
Now you a stranger nothing like the way you was
But uh you not real you not Rachel
You not Worm you not Dill shit you not chill
I thought you had some couth
Fuck the fake shit Im really feel that you tryna screw me
And you a little smarter than the average dude
So it took a nigga just a little longer to see
They tried to warn me fought with my girl erry night about you
Shit only hurts cause she was right about you
She run around wanting to shoot you the fair one
I keep telling her chill I dont care none
I got another side I never showed to you
The side where everybody is disposable
See relationships are never a threat
Cause Ill erase the history and act like we never met
Become done giving a fuck and done calling
I got your email I was done way before then oh 
Dear Diary I dont wanna keep shit inside of me
Id rather just speak to you privately
Maybe its my mood as far as I can see
Theres really no point in having this guy with me
Change from the days of us getting in your truck
Its bigger than one song its bigger than a buck
Its bigger than me bigger than buck
Bigger than voodoo its bigger than luck shit its bigger than us
I always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way when 
When Im really the fool for tryna teach em
When the blinds leading the blind you cant reach em
If niggas aint as hungry as you then why feed em
Niggas aint tryna be lead then why lead em
Having big problems with your dogs why breed em
Ill keep my part up keep my guard up
Was like Thundercats but changed faster than Cheetara
This a small part of a larger issue
Sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to
But we all equal no one lower or above me
I love my team just as much as they love me
If not more
If I turn the knob we all going through the door I aint coming back for yall
The whole crew feel the same as me
How could you ignore something so plain to see
Im being ignant that get on my nerves every minute
Whats plain to some is really Burberry printed
Being so real sometimes is a slow kill
We was one squad you broke out like Mike Schofield
I want fillet mignon you want oatmeal
Add up our differences equals up to no meal
No mills yup no deal why you gotta chase sht
To know its no thrills for real
A nigga still beefin with his baby momma BUT 
Only thing my baby aint a baby no more
Hit her on MySpace maybe she aint shady no more
Sent old girl a message no reply but she read it
Some things are so embedded and our heads is
Looking for Os but get Xs dealing wit ya exes
I was one long line away from the Tetris
She sent me the L that sent me to hell
To the point where Im denied my son
I dont see him dont talk to him I dont greet him dont walk wit him
But I pay for him like hes an object
No matter how right I am in court I cant object
Dear Diary how could she deny me
How she go to bed without it fucking with her psyche
Is she wrong using him so I can come back or 
Am I wrong for wishing I could get my cum back
Looking for sun all I see is the hail
How Im gon trust All I see is betrayal

5678,"Dedicated to my son thats about to be born
So by the time you people hear this record
My sonll be born
And I gotta teach him about life
Listen
To my little man you can never have too little plans
Always bring your game direct cut out the middle man
Life is full of sacrifice for truth you might have to fight
Someonell bring you down cause they aint livin right
Be sure to use your mind though look for all the signs yo
Dont want to make a move too quick and get left behind yo
Be in command of whatever you encounter
Appreciate your blessings son youll see what it amounts to
Obtaining your goals maintainin control
Selfrespect helps you to protect your soul
Never give up always be ready to try
Walk your own walk and keep your head to the sky
Wait a minute baby now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep eat and cry
But one day youre gonna be askin me why
Everything I know Ima tell you about
Anything I dont youll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
And then you pass it on
And to my home boys who clearly understand
What it really takes to be a man and what it means to be the head of fam
The ups and downs of life plus the choices we make
Causes to reevaluate directions we take
And being up in the club is mad fun til they act dumb
And everyone still packs guns whether nines or mac oneones
Its time now for us to separate
The mediocre from the great keep all the jokers from the game
Ive played my position so why dont you try to play yours
Ive made my decision plus youre in my prayers
My life is changed now plus I got a shorty now
Mad responsibilities its like Im almost forty now
All the young girls wanna swing my wifey says she wants a ring
I wonder what the next days are gonna bring
We must live and fight for the right causes and be ready to die
I love you kid so keep your head to the sky
Wait a minute baby now here you are
Staring at me with those baby eyes
All you do is sleep eat and cry
But one day youre gonna be askin me why
Everything I know Ima tell you about
Anything I dont youll figure out
Cause living is learnin and learnin is livin
And then you pass it on
Baby child did you know
Ever since you fell out the heavens you made me wanna grow
So Ill share with you everything
Make little girls and boys grow up to be kings and queens

5365,"Distraction Occupy Wall Street Freestyle LyricsNowadays we be rocking glasses for fashion
And fucking with life a fraction
Covered in Max Factor hustling assbackwards
As sure as HiTek look like Richard from Last Dragon
Your focus on bogus rappers got you caught up in distraction
Distraction Who fucking who Who cares Thats distraction
You wish it was you dont you why you asking
Try to break the law of attraction
Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your blood and you believe in the immortals
We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder
See the water drawing away from the shore
This aint no ordinary storm
We killing for a humanitarian cause
But have yet to show up in Darfur
The Arab Spring is what its called
But its looking at the pride before the fall
They say it aint about the spoils of war
But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost
Steal the land from the Native American and call the missiles Tomahawks
Make him a mascot dress up like him for sport
As a final assault to his beautiful culture
Scavengers feasting on the dead like a vulture
Snacking how you keeping up with my rapping
You barely keeping up with Kardashians
You caught up in distraction
Its the living proof you try to make the truth elastic as Mr Fantastic
We recycling these rappers
Truthfully these niggas is plastic
Coming through the front door blasting
I aint talking bout them emails
That you always send to the masses
That somehow end up in my trash bin
My niggas got the aim of sharpshooters and the hearts of assassins
All this war all this life all this passion
The game is distraction
Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin
Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in
Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters
My deep cuts way above your minor infractions
Talk to rappers like children cause thats how they acting
They holding their hands like minors in traffic
The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo
Have a deepseeded fear of change
For them its strange they wanna go
Back to the 50s they asking for a return
But them days is much blacker for lack of a better term
We adapted to the times but this culture we had to learn
Came about as natural as a perm on a pachyderm
These fascists have had their turn
We packing them German burners them Lugers
The next shooters waiting for Superman they get nothing but Lex Luthor
Americas nightmare vivid as Fred Kruger
Our heroes are dead to us
Spirit that bled through us
Endear us with the spirit so the flow is so foolish
What you hearing is precision
The people so thirsty what they seeing is mirages
But this passion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages
Coming through like Collossus
Exposing the false prophet
Taught how to do the knowledge so Im never offtopic
A lie is like a potion
First it gets you open
Then you swallow whole straight for the truth
Fuck the chaser skip religion and the politics
And head straight to the compassion
Everything else is a distraction

50,"Well Ive been on the road
For a long time
Met a lot of women
Had to leave them all behind
Because I want to go back
To the land I love
Where Magnolia smells sweet
And white cotton is warm
Take me on back
Back to the country
Take me on down down
Greenwood Mississippi
Old farmer John
He lives down the road
Works in the fields
Carrying a heavy load
He dont have to worry
About a thing
Because evryday now
You can hear him sing

Rappin about shit you aint never seen or had no parts in youknowhatImsayin
Shit aint cool man ay Lo take em where you from
Let me take you to a place where the sun dont shine
Killers dont talk little kids dont mind
Men dont work dont take care of babies
You bought my album but bootleggers dont pay me
City runnin wild cats dont give a fuck
Junior High students dont say no to drugs
Liquor stores dont ask shorties for their ID
This is a place where dont nothin surprise me
The ghetto
The ghetto yo
Now you can get shot everyday its a struggle to be alive
Mentally physically only the strong survive
Cant hide from the fact ghettos is filled with blacks blacks 
Crack crack smack smack roaches and rats
Thugs totin they gats this aint a nice place to visit
The people that you live with hearts cold and frigid
That girl over there dont even bother with her why 
Shes a hoodrat golddigger never had a father figure
Her older brother was a big time drug dealer
When he was young his role model was a drug dealer
Now that hes older everybody wants to cop a boulder
He took a bullet in his head now hes in a coma bloaw 
You callin 911 this aint a joke
You rollin like a blunt cause you might get smoked
The sad part about it aint the money or the dope
The trigger man wasnt even old enough to vote
Shit aint all good in the hood
Touch mine wish a nigga would
You knowhatImsayin In the ghetto 
Landlords dont do nothin but collect rent
Police dont patrol serve or protect it
Brothers dont allow others to hustle on they block
Always carry heat cause the beef dont stop
And it dont quit everyday the same shit
Hustlin to get you what your job cant get
And I aint even talkin bout a Benz or Mercedes what you talkin about 
Im talkin about toothpaste diapers for your babies
The basic necessities of life
The homeless sleepin in a cardboard box every night
The only playgrounds is vacant lots and burned buildings
You gotta feel sorry for the children
How they gon do they homework when they homes dont work
They cant read books cause the lights dont work nope 
They cant take a bath cause the water dont work nope 
The stove in the kitchen plus the heat dont work nope 
Its cold at night they mommas cant afford jackets
She too busy tryin to support the crack habit
The State took her kids now they all doin bids man that sound crazy 
I know it sound crazy but thats how it is in the ghetto
The ghetto
All I see are hearts thats hollow from Detroit to Chicago
Just hopin you can follow
Shits real I know it sounds crazy
Shit its how it is how it is
This is a place where Nothin surprise me

1812,"Driving compulsion morbid thoughts come to mind
Sexual release buried deep inside
Complete control of a prized possession
To touch and fondle with no objection
Lonely souls an emptiness fullfilled
Physical pleasure and addictive thrill
An object of perverted reality
An obsession beyond your wildest dreams
Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die
The excitement of dissection is sweet
My skin crawls with orgasmic speed
A lifeless object for my subjection
An obsession beyond your imagination
Primitive instinct a passion for flesh
Primal feeding on the multitudes of death
Sadistic acts a love so true
Absorbingly masticating a part of you
Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die
I need a friend
Please be my companion
I dont want to be
Left alone with my sanity
Erotic sensations tingle my spine
A dead body lying next to mine
Smooth blue black lips
I start salivating as we kiss
Mine forever this sweet death
I cannot forget your soft breaths
Panting excitedly with my hands around your neck
Shades are drawn
No one can see
What Ive done
Whats become of me
Here I stand
Above all thats been true
How I love
How I love to kill you

Say she want to eat sushi I gave her enough to go shoppin
Anything she wantâsheâcashin out withoutâno problems
How you gon love aânigga that aint got love for your mama
You can die today it aint gon save me nothin but drama Super 
Workin on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual Like usual 
Niggas swear they passed us they doin too much
Havent done my taxes Im too turnt up
Pluto
Help me fight my demons off know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar she didnt wanna leave
Treat her like garbage my heart was on my sleeve
Shouldve chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep
Why should I have trust for you You aint get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you You aint kneelin to my feet
Why should I be carin when I know I cant be beat
See how the ice be glarin when I come through and retrieve
Its easy to know its us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket you niggas beneath me
Who causin a racket in Jamaica on the weekend
Half a ticket on vacation I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son right or wrong FBG shit Freebandz

Cant you tell that your ties too wide
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin out lately honey
You cant dress trashy til you spend a lot of money
Everybodys talkin bout the new sound
Funny but its still rock and roll to me
Whats the matter with the car Im driving
Cant you tell that its out of style
Should I get a set of whitewall tires
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile
Nowadays you cant be too sentimental
Your best bets a true baby blue Continental
Hot funk cool punk even if its old junk
Its still rock and roll to me
Oh it doesnt matter what they say in the papers
Cause its always been the same old scene
Theres a new band in town but you cant get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Dont waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers
Next phase new wave dance craze anyways
Its still rock and roll to me
Alright Richie

Ooh

Dont you know that theyre out of touch
Should I try to be a straight A student

UPS rapper at your door ringing your buzzer
With another special delivery full of drama
Sorta like you getting fan mail from the Unabomber
I hit a rhyme your mind is out in left field
You blinded by the sunshine you cant catch it
Your skills wretched you far from a Ken Griffey
I speak Jedi talk and Skywalk the force with me
This track lit me Im dynamite with the mic
I explode instrumentals my production is combustion
You a MC but Im more like a M80
Now which one of you jerks wanna see how this fire works
You crazy cause Im known to blow the set
Tick tick tick means I aint exploded yet
You whack crews is hit when my rap fuse is lit
I pull pins from grenades to write my rhymes with
Nuclear reaction from the crowd when I split
My rap competition like atoms like fission
Bomb squads try to take position
But I refuse to be defused so it proves to be a dead mission
Listen to this lyrical display
I blow your mind microphone Timothy McVeigh
A warning to you pilots leave your planes in the hanger
Cause terrorist attack fly at your track danger
Im a stranger never seen it before
This type of rap style is similar to C4
I combine with the rhymes like flames with gun powder
United we stand ignited we make noise

6043,"Some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them and never will
Im only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like its heading for a dead end
Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel its quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just cant take it
And every day I ask myself How will I make it
It seems like my lifes been cursed ever since I was a child
And how will I make it I wont thats how
I walk around with a frown I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it I wont thats how
Aiyo times was rough I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it I wont thats how
I always knew that Id end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it I wont thats how
Five years passed by now Im at the age of 15
No more fun and games its time to get cream
Cause Im about to burst its like my life was cursed
I went to church prayed everyday and it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets late robbing suckers for funds
Now everyday I creep with the heat aint nothing sweet
I rob for meat If I dont steal I dont eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living Hell
Then I started to realize Im better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep now I can eat
Cant hit skins but I wasnt hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiyo I just cant take it
And every day I ask myself How will I make it
Doing time was full of stress G
All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didnt find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease Im back on the streets again
I hope I dont get snatched by the beast again
But its getting crazy hectic cause Im broke get up naked
And cant get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for their change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either Ima go back to jail or get murdered but do I deserve it
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I cant get a fair shot
I just cant take it
And every day I ask myself How will I make it
Word up man its real rough out here man
In the ghetto all you can wish for is a better tomorrow
It aint getting no better its only getting worse word up

Grand spittage HAM with it fam dig its N9ne
Chea Hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles coming softer than a cats meow
Red laces but booted like Im Iraq bound
That frownll get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal pat down gat down back down blackout
With a fat smile I might react foul
So dont make this cat growl

Real shitStyles P Shit
If P want you dead I aint comin wit niggas
Just a blunt and a tre pound plenty of liquor
So ya homies got something to pour
Thats that old school shit
I aint tryin to put you under the floor
Im tryin ta bang niggas over the clouds
And I heard you say you rich
So you cant get lower than Styles
Kill everybody dead just so noone can smile
Play the streets my whole life and I been flowin a while
Biget I rock ever since my nigga was shot and my other nigga
Will shoot shit Im tellin the truth
If I lie may I die in the middle of the verse
My niggas hustle from first to first
Twelve months in a year
Gun on your waist Blunt in your ear
Pack in your sock crate at the back of the block
With a fiend watchin for NARCS till the shit get dark
We hop in the hoop ride instead of the six
While you lookin for a bitch we lookin for a brick
That we can cook by six and give the whole block a fix
Catch me OT gettin sixty a shift
Holidy Styles nigga I aint nothin but streets
Just as hard as the shit that be under your feet
And the only time I front is with a blunt in the beak
To show niggas that Im nice and they aint fuckin wit me
Felony Niggas
Cop coke Heavily Niggas
Thatll arm rob seventy niggas

Murderin niggas
You want dope they servin you niggas
Stay in 5th gear swervin on niggas
You know
Whether we ryde or we die we gon get this dough
All I know is drugs and guns
And plenty of weed
And that bitch that suck dick
And niggas that bleed
And if youre rich before you go
Get a watch and a drop
You better hit the court house
And better bail out the block
If your son aint worth shit
Niggasll smuggle your daughter
I come through in a Porshe
The same color as water
I got weight what you want
I can cover the order
They call me Boss when I cross the border
Six shot caught her
I hear niggas say my face is screwed
But Ill put six in your stomach nigga
Lace your food
Scream Fuck Every Rapper that hate that Im rude
But thats that SP shit you can take it or move
We can let the bullets spill till we all get killed
Theres only six nice rappers
If you wanna be real
Niggas die everyday from talking that dumb shit
That where theyre from shit
All that mean to me is you can get your gun quick
Just another dumb bitch
Go to church to get the holy ghost
I did my dirt and got the holy ghost
Look at the world through a niggas eyes
Dont be a bitch you gonna live and die
Ribbon in the sky but no love when you slither by
I pray to god that we make it to heaven
But the only thing we makin is channel eleven
You know four five and seven hot as fuck
And every rapper be dead if they were hotter than us
But since niggas still alive they should be tellin you somethin
You aint hear from Holiday he aint tellin you nothin

8106,"A Message from Yasiin Bey Lyrics
Peace this is Yasiin
No more parties in SA
Please tell em no more parties in SA
Aint home arrest I dont need to stay
Ill leave and Ill stay away
I committed no crime any place
Why these police up in my face
Why they raiding my place
Why I dont feel safe
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
My intentions are pure in coming here
And thats for everything I love or hold dear
Umis in the building
So is my wife and my children
I committed no crime
Why is the state wasting my time
They must be out of their minds
I forgive em thats the spirit of divine
I just wanna go where Im wanted
Where Im loved stop frontin
Where I live is my choice you cannot mute my voice
Thank you Kanye West for being a real friend a real friend
A real friend
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SA
I heard your choice the first time Ill go away
And when I leave thats exactly where Ill stay
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
A country called Earth everywhere
A country called Earth everywhere
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SAThats just a freestyle I had to let that out Peace to all fear none this is Yasiin Bey At this present time I am currently in Cape Town South Africa and Im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason Theyre saying that they want to deport my family Uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious which it is not Anyone can do the research about the world passport its not a fictitious document It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all In fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015 You can see the stamps theyre there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate To quote Lil Durk I am not a liar Ive made no false claims I have not misrepresented myself Im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way Im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also umIts curious I havent broken any law and Im being treated like a criminal I know Im not unique in that regard and I am grateful that Im here with my family I havent been physically harmed or anything like that However I have been detained People in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily Theres no reason I have to spend any time in the cell Theres no reason I had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all This is not an administration of justice and all I seek is to leave the state Im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because Im not I just wanna go home and I dont live in America and I have the right to domicile wherever I please without fear or without interference
The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily And thats fine we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either My family and I are prepared immediately to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state never to return to this state again We dont have to be here Were not pining to be here and were complying in every possible way reasonably Just today state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family and they had no right to do so I have legal representation here who they could easily contact Theyre contravening and breaking all types of international law and its untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on And I know its been a lot of chatter about whats going on you know people are running to the press because thats justyou know a money making machine So its another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera some telenovella and I have no interest in it Furthermore related but not directly related to this Im retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today and also from Hollywood effective immediately I am releasing my final album this year Umand thats that
Peace to all fear of none Thank everyone for their time Much success to you even if you wish me the opposite as Nas said And Im on the side of the right so people could wish however they want but I aint nobodysI aint no threat or a hazard to nobody I really try to mind my business What people think about me is none of my business and Im not here to change peoples opinions about me You dont have to like me you dont have to like everything that I say The fact is is that I have hurt no one I have injured no parties and all I require as is my lawful right is innocent passage to my domicile That is all
In summary I will say this I will close with a simple prayer To the one who has created the all you know me better than I know myself and I know myself better than people know me So forgive me for whatever they know or do not know Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said Ameen ameen allahumma ameen
And Ill close for you Ye with the with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori And and shout out to Madlib and Otis andandand Michael and his entire family and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in LA I wish you and your family the best your mother you know reach out to me Egon you know yall know how to reach Shout out to Corey Smyth shout out to my brother Talib Kweli salaam to my brother Kamaal Fareed Ali Shaheed Muhammad Islam all of the Zulu Nation The Zulu Nation real here theres real Zulus My brother Siyabonga the Madlalas All of the people here who have supported me this is no reflection on you I love the people of this country I love this continent I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state They waste enough of my time and Im through with you Felicia were through I dont want nothing from you You can keep the records the sweatshirts everything its no problem But Ill end with this verse that I wanna put on No More Parties in LA if you would kindly allow me my dear brother Kanye And shout out to K Lamar too I see you my dudeLonely America crazy America

just to make things clear A country called Earth everywhere A country called Earth everywhere No more parties in SA Please no more parties in SAThats just a freestyle I had to let that out Peace to all fear none this is Yasiin Bey At this present time I am currently in Cape Town South Africa and Im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason Theyre saying that they want to deport my family Uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious which it is not Anyone can do the research about the world passport its not a fictitious document It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all In fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015 You can see the stamps theyre there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate To quote Lil Durk I am not a liar Ive made no false claims I have not misrepresented myself Im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way Im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also umIts curious I havent broken any law and Im being treated like a criminal I know Im not unique in that regard and I am grateful that Im here with my family I havent been physically harmed or anything like that However I have been detained People in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily Theres no reason I have to spend any time in the cell Theres no reason I had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all This is not an administration of justice and all I seek is to leave the state Im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because Im not I just wanna go home and I dont live in America and I have the right to domicile wherever I please without fear or without interference The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily And thats fine we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either My family and I are prepared immediately to

Twice the chemical of Clorox
Then I do an autopse on four cops
When my jaws drop ock I fidget my nuts alot
Got the two Glocks with oowops then bodies trace the chalk

With black cats and Haleys Comet blazin blunts in my driveway
Nostradamus predicted for you funk fiends

7872,"Second Round KO Lyrics
Yo Canibus man whats up man
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man you were booming
But I caught these foul slouchass niggas you know I mean
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard man I wasnt with that
But I aint know you well enough to defend you though right
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game man theyve been playing me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Did right you know what I mean
But they cant hurt us man we gonna do it
Get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself man
You dont got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you man get up in there move that head man
Come on to me man but when you come man
You gotta come for blood man
Come up to me man come on bust that nigga whole
Man niggas talking that shit about you
Hey Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat eat eat eat MCs for lunch breakfast
Hey man they been playing me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times did right
No but they cant hurt us man
We gonna do it get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself man
Yo Ima let the world know the truth you dont want me to shine
You studied my rhyme then you laid your vocals after mine
Thats a bitch move somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum you only droppin clues
I studied your background read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drugfree role model you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you aint got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99 of your fans wear high heels
From IceT to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me You must be crazy
You drippin with wack juice and you cant get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start nigga
Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder than that man
You dont want no bitchass niggas hanging out with me man
Were warriors man when we go into battle
We come out or dont come out at all
You better give me the respect that I deserve or Ima take it by force
Blast you with a 45 Colt make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war now you wanna talk
Its about who strikes the hardest not who strikes first
Thats why I laugh when I hear that wackass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
Its because of him now at least I know what beef is
Its not what I would call this see this is somethin different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin off of dissin
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin himself cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you somethin you might got more cash than me
But you aint got the skills to eat a niggas ass like me
And if you really want to show off we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
Ill let you kick a versefuck it Ill let you kick em all
Ill even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom your first second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say Naw he started it he forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it man you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because its been a minute Ill forget it
Fuck that Cause like Common and Cube I See the Bitch in Yoo
And Ima make the world see it too motherfucker
Ladies and gentlemen we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds Canibus
Yo Canibus man you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man you inandout and youre agile with your flow man
But dig right you got to eat man
Thats your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you but dig right
Hey Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat eat eat eat MCs
For lunch breakfast dinner thats your agenda baby
Your agenda to consume them
Their whole existence they cant exist in your presence

7260,"Tony Story Pt 2 Lyrics
Paulie killed Tony right Right 
And Tony killed Ty so it was only right Right 
Thinkin back twenty years they was homies tight
Sixth grade for the love of the paper aint nothin nice Uhuh 
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles blowing paper balling hard he know they hating
But they gon respect it cause he rocked Tony Tony 
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding they ready to fall for him They ready 
Cause word on the street that Paulie did that That 
Used Key gold digging ass to get back Back 
Text him through her phone found out where he live at Yeah 
She woke up in the morning like I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth fitting to start a war
Cause Tonys little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law Lord 
And Paulie on a rise now On a rise 
Niggas that played the middle pickin sides now Pickin sides now 
Plus he heard Tonys brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head he gotta die now I want this nigga dead 
Paulies youngest on the corner
Tonys little brother he slipping yeah hes a goner
Fuckin with that lean he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too reachin bet you they get up on him
The gat jam he bang back tryna avoid em
Them niggas dumpin he get up running and hittin on em
He hit the alley get a body he dipping on em
Said its on now try and kill em its war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feelin like he dead it aint no remorse now

Madonna life is so crazy
Youve been through a lot
Ill tell you stories sometimes yknow
Seemed like yesterday I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent on the lower east side
I threw my tag around let Bboys take me for a ride
I started writing songs I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I cant explain
I didnt listen to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered
Talk to em talk to em 
I expressed myself came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart I learned the power of goodbye
I saw a ray of light music saved my life Music saved my life 
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I cant explain
I didnt listen to what people said What you did 
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant as the northern star

I came I saw I conquered Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered Uh  Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered
In 1994 I came through the door What 
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers murdered murdered murdered 
My moms from the Carolinas pops from Natchez
And QBs where I started flowin
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick em dont I
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule Im too big to lose
Now whos the fool
And I aint never been happier no lie
Im just your humble servant Im Nas
If yall burn down Ferguson Ima riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trapper trapper any rapper rapper 
Any politician beautician or musician
Anybody saw many bodies
Many coffins heads or tails
Penny tosses either that or jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from
I was fearless like a renegade Try to tell em 
I had a feeling that I cant explain
I didnt listen to what people said
I came I saw I conquered

4626,"Im obsessed with multiple nude photographs
Of the beat in my room on the wall
Pondering the verses fondling my balls
Witness a nigga who will take rap and chase it
Through unoccupied dimly lit staircases and rape it
Grab the drums by the waistline
I snatch the kick kick the snares and sodomize the bassline
Never waste time I give the verse rabies
Cum on the chorus tell the hook to swallow my babies
Maybe I might switch let the witch live
The original plan was to kill the bitch on the bridge
Ditch the body parts off somewhere near the crescendo
When my innuendos elapse my mental window attacks
The instrumental elapses
Perhaps thats the only reason that I spared her life
You could solo my fucking vocals and I still get trife
Slice the rhythm disfigure the face of the groove
For any fader that flies or knobs or button that moves
Consider this the loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole a vicious cycle of sin
That doesnt end til I stop fuckin
A million emcees and they aint saying nothing
Aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it like me
She had the nerve to take the case to court
Knowing I rape for sport
Took the stand crying denying her whole involvement lying
Why would an excop lie in a sex shop fly
Linen down grinning with my coat over my shoulder sitting
Browsing pornography uh 
The stenographer smiling the whole time
While jotting verbal photography
Her eyes mahogany I flashed to a photo
In my mind of a body bludgeoned with slashed arteries
Pardon me back to the case slap in the face
Examining the jury similar to cracking a safe
What happens to bass It was an instinct
I would inhale eighths
Sniff that sat her ass all over my face to taste it
To hell with 1980 remixes fuck disco
Turned on the 3000 stuck my dick where the disc go
Yokonaz ripped the sexy MPC 60
Buying a ticket to hell verbally dicking the 12 down
Sound shitty I knew she used to be gritty
Too many impotent emcees in this Godforsaken city
Aint fucking it right aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it like me
Consider this loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole a vicious cycle of sin
That doesnt end til I stop fuckin
A million emcees and they aint saying nothing
Aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it like me

Where they sell you grease in a box and hope that you die quicker
And if youre old enough to walk to the store you can buy liquor
Where you can find a dice game at any time of the night
And somebody gets shot or stabbed every time theres a fight
Where cats die in the blue sky and the sunlight
And ya bound to get clowned for not holdin ya gun right
By little kids with great game cause they learned to take aim
At a young age and elude police with a fake name

Tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
Girl tell me what they mad for
Tell me what they mad for
If you sellin all the records and you fuckin all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin home to visit
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid is you skatin is you dissin
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Wont need it in your name like Pac when he went missing
Makaveli lives on so Im riding on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness Lord Willin I was dealing
Stupid motherfucking five star tatted on his ceiling
Bullseye be the motherfucking target for this killing

While they blowing that smoke Im blowing a couple millions
Making a killing stunting on imposters
Only rapper in the game with a grammy and a Oscar
Seven figure movie deals eight figure bank runs
And Im still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got Ive already drove
Any chick that you hit my nigga Ive already hoed
Say it with your chest like these diamonds in my charm
Name on my headphones label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say Ludacris is insane
That nigga daughers birthday is the tail number on his plane
Fuck with me but nobody fucking with me
Taking a shot of my Cognac
More millions real Gs chugging with me

So if somebody can somebody please

6527,"Cruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the freaks clockin the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there coldshootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo man
Get the fuck out
Pump that bass
Mothafucker say what
Donald Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the streets to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12gauge
One sucka dead LA Times front page
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo Leroy
Beer drinkin breath stinkin sniffin glue
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath started stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappyass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross coldknocked him out
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Who do you think you are Mr big stuff
Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped my 64 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
LA playa
Big Drum Beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas causin a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out Fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin the trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Get busy yall

As I sit in my bboy stance
With flipflops and socks and sweatpants
Im finna enhance your brains check it out
Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didnt have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes walking to the store
Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet
Cause I got the heat in my baby momma name now
Never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson
Never talk to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cause we dont sell dope
That you distribute
We dont contribute to your clandestine activity
My soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hateliars and thieves they make my blood boil
Boa constricted on my soul that they coil
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up I did but I did so not safely
Dont want no AIDS clapping no claps or no rabies
Yeah we take no shit like ummm stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call they done locked up my folks
Low blow hit me in the left ventricle
We wont be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people fore your rims at the curb
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead go head go head
More head for me while you ride to the beat
Drop like tears like For Fears you know
Shout shout let it all out just for my peers
And peoples who feel its time to unwind
Like December 31st on nineteenninetynine
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Okay like this yes yes
One time for my boys doing King shit
Two times too legit and it dont quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times OutKast and it dont stop
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the T eating chicken wings
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop
Four times OutKast and it dont stop
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel

8015,"Im an angeldemon man
You know what Im sayin what makes me a demon is lust a girl crazy and thats why I couldnt keep my wife
You know what Im sayin and thats the lust demon livin within me
And uh but my heart love big you know what Im sayin so
I know a lot of demons come to my shows as well as angels
You know what Im sayin a lot of demons
When I was one anda two anda three anda four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an ittybitty demon
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no 
Can I kill it Hell no Can I kill it Hell no 
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no 
Can I kill it Hell no Can I kill it Hell no 
Yo it make me wanna drink a lot go up in the pink with naught
This the reason I aint at ease and currently on the brink of pop
This the reason I sit at the window with the millie
Wishing a nigga gon come break in
It is the reason I be freaking a woman deeper
Loving making her silly because I done they friends
It is the reason I bang it is definitely the reason I slang
Distributed the caine
The reason Im supersoaking in the pain and starting to love it
Its wanting to give me way more of it they want me to lug it through the mud
And thus the reason with happy people Im disgusted
Im talking about those thangs that make you do bad thangs
Living the evil up in the fast lane
Making me wanna have a wicked persona
Beating the hell up out of people making me mad mane
Gave me the gun when I ran up in dealings in the ninth grade with a slight rage
I was Ice Age another reason Tecca N9na wont have any light days
Voted me the King of Darkness voted me to be really heartless
All up in my spirit they march they making me start sparking other targets
Woke up today I was steaming cause when I found out I was not dreaming
Because the host that influenced me the most was a goddamn demon
When I was one anda two anda three anda four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an ittybitty demon
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no 
Can I kill it Hell no Can I kill it Hell no 
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no

I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it and burned that man
The way that I live dont concern that man
We gon have to settle this another way
When the knuckles turn white and the eyes begin bulging
I take an honest look at my life its insulting
And I been sulking about it all week
Hearing the dull screech of metal grinding the concrete
And sparks dance where the worst of both worlds clash
Meaning the blue tyrants and my broke ass
I understand this is pawn take pawn shit
But Ill be damned if you shoot me on my lawn bitch
Think twice before shining that light
In my drawers in the alley in the middle of the night
Garbage bag and house shoes put two and two together
I aint no drug smuggler Im a struggling brother
I have this dream where I go nuts
Dial 911 from the roof and post up
Decorate your hard head when you came in the cruiser
And paint rod red in the name of Abdullah
x2
What kind of sucker would I have to be after these years
Of you harassing and attacking me to run and join your cavalry
Imagine me all GI Joed up in Afghanistan somewhere prepared to go nuts
You clinically crazy if you think you could pay me
A figure that could make me slay these innocent babies
I identify with a slave wishing to break free
He was victimised by the same system that raped me
Look at us poor just trying to get our foot in the door
And unfortunatley hooked in this war
We were both coerced to get enlisted
But his was with a trigger mine was living conditions
Were one in the same but in the name of some freedom
Im supposed to put one in his brain like something will change
What freedom I aint dying for no president
Sending kids to die when we didnt even elect the bitch
x2
Listen Im in no position to judge a young stud
Tryna use the military to come the fuck up
Cos self preservation is the first law of nature
Play your cards smart remember what the fucks up
Its really no different from crack pedaling when it
Comes to dying and killing for a dream you were given
Last thing in your mind is how you seen by the system
N be willing to go to those extremes for your vision
Shit Im no smarter Im fucking retarded
I just know enough to not eat directly where the dog shits
If Uncle Sam wants to threaten my health
Tell him he have to come and get me himself

Fuck the Empire

I never roll for dolo fronting on mes a nono
Understand doing this for my family
Ha ha check it out yall
Yo Im trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up told my daddy Id be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon switch hand
Get todays solid ground out of yesterdays quicksand
I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man
On small looseleaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but nowaday its time for me
The streets is watching me I watch back thats the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seekin the North beacon
From beating and hogeating from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding cotton thorns in your palms
Its for yall that I sketch these songs and it goes
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go manoamano
Kweli is you with me What up what up 
Lets make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow looking for a brighter day
When yall wanna leave yall
Right away
Shout it out from EastWest from South to Northern 
From Cackalack to California 
From the coldest to the warmest 
To the borders cross the waters understand

These cats be giving us praise but it aint that accurate
I give it up to God all that love and attachment get
Scary wellprepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to em clearly
Yall dont hear me though even when Im coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo why you starting me
I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent with the tears and sweat and what I bleed
MCs imitate the way we walk the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off
You come across soft
Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guestlist
Its like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it MCs in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know its only cause I love you
Shout it out from EastWest
From South to Northern 
From the richest to the poorest 
To the elders in the coffins 
Living native dying for it understand
And know that I love you
Yea yea we got love in the place
Shout out from up top to the middle 
To black bottom sky high 
Whether you colder than December
Or hotter than July

I just turned off the TV man
Kids out there be thinkin they hardcore man
We gotta do somethin man yo
Do it
Little girls think theyre hardcore 4X 
You got nine cars tons of champagne by the cases
Two thousand people killed fake murder cases
Videos exaggerate things you never make
Your style is all tissue chocolate fudge cream cake
The companies back you people out there wanna slap you
Original fraud funny with a mic cord
Persuadin kids that you hard every stage you tour
Cold scared you in a motel you cant come out
After the show with panties on you hurry run out
You petrified hallucinatin thinkin hardcore
You got the style now you have to roll with 50 people
Lookin hard and mean you aint pullin triggers
Did you pay your bodyguards for actin hard
You get pistolwhipped booty tapped face scarred
Down and out with camouflage gear and no war
You aint in the army kid
Little girls think theyre hardcore 3X 
Now your shows packed up youre gassed up
Im there youre scared
You just turned trois looked away feelin weird
You on the walkie talkie standin close near the door
Thinkin bout your records how you pop doodoo more
Posses wait in Texas Detroit for the bumrush
You bringin rubber your crew is nervous smokin dust
You perpetrate your front show your teeth smokin blunts
Rappers cancel shows ran away with stunts
Your manager scared with ghetto mugs starin at him
Your crew pressured more to even act harder
You took New York down South them folks wasnt havin that
Three kids from DC pulled out what you laughin at
You ran out funny style girl style panty style
Freestyle the same style last week
You was bitin off that kid Bo Peep
With no panties on your rectum got torn
Rearranged I caught you after the show
Naked out butt out cracked out with two rolls of film
Tryin to sell pictures of your lover
With you molestin your little brother
I smacked you and stole your pistols
Little girls think theyre hardcore 4X 
Tommy didnt I raise you to go to Catholic school
But mom I gotta keep this up this is all a front
This is just gimmicks to sell my records
The people dont have to know
I mean really thats just me even though were soft

We just make money thats all its a gimmick

7510,"Go Crazy Remix Lyrics
Guess whos back
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme I was cooking them Os
Like horseshoes I was tossing them Os
Time to reup gotta recycle the flow
Im emotional I hug the block
Im so emotional I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me so whats realer
About the scrilla call me a Ghostface Killa
Its kinda hard to be drugfree
When Georgia Power wont give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles been killin em ever since
It pays to tell the truth dog it only makes sense
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club pimping doing my thang
More than a hustla Im the definition of it
Master chef lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend homey its Hova
More than a relief pitcher Im the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks the whole worlds about to hear me out
See Im a hustlers hope Im not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success Im what they might mean
Attract money my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is JayZ Blue
Dont follow me youngun follow my moves Im not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo
I was at my video Cris on the speedboat
In My Lifetime nigga go through your research
St Thomas my nigga that was me first
Chromeshoed the GS I came feetfirst
In the game like a baby born to breach birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like Nah Hov talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy JayZ
See Imma 80s baby master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks every day is college
You aint did nothin I aint did nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor I sprayed Lamis
Still the timell reveal you know Im bein honest
Ya aint put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades cause your boy that bright
Good night
Whattup Jeez
Crackslife whats the matter with your head
Crackslife all you niggas gon end up dead
Crackslife everybody servin rat til he ride
Everybody think they somebody til somebody end up shot
Listen Im in that GT chopper on the passenger side
No skeets skeets chopper on the passenger side
They said Trap or Die but said fuck it
Damn near half my life I been a suspect
Feds low in them Coupe Devilles
So I keep one eye open like Bushwick Bill
They said my minds playin tricks on me
So I let off a half a clip on em
Aint no witnesses tellin the story
Then my bitch spent all of the bail money
I done gave em my pimp cup for a gangsta hat
Traded my gangsta hat for some gangsta raps
Only to find out that no gangstas rap
Half of these niggas is pussy aint never served crack
Its like a damn nightmare
Just when you thought I was gone I reappear
On some chopped up screwed shit papi got his swagga back
Hot sick clue shit bought a brick of half of rap
In that cedes when its said and done
Yeah papi kinda crazy squeeze the pound for fun
Wont stop til my whole team in thug mansion
And I say I like Pac now thats a thugs passion
And this the realist shit I ever wrote
And all eyes on me like a microscope
Young Jeezy give em one more chance
Tried to shine like you and spent his whole advance
Like my main man Pulla talk real slick
Look Im ok but my watch sick
Yean gotta like a nigga just respect my mind
And this how Im eatin now so respect my grind
The way I put them words together
Minds me how I used to put them birds together
Buy 18 the hard way
Have a humble nigga thinking about gun play
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns
A lot of holes a lot of blood dogthe shit aint fun
So I suggest you dont play with my chains
Ill send these hollows atchya let em play with ya brain
The streets is watching the name is warm
The products white a star is born Yeah 
And Im so fly if I take this parachute off I might fall and die
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex
Then we ship it out of town call it safe sex

Set the beacons afire for them all
Call to arms all the men far and wide
Have to fight now for dynasty pride at stake
The invaders repel from the north
Keep out nomads who come from the plains
Northern grasslands awash with them all
Blocking the tribes that invade from the south of us
Rallying round to the call
We can hear far away are the sound of distant drums
And they need everyone at the wall
So the day of our judgement has now begun to fall
Survive on ledges bitten in dust
Knowledge and virtue is stricken by lust
Really believe that theyre coming for us
Dancing on graves of those who bled for us
Driven away by our endless desire
Defeat by anger and our greatest fire
Attack again and try as they might
Hold them again and see them running

And they need everyone at the wall

Must be patient

That we can win
What will save us
The great wall
Now under siege have the real strength to hold them now
Have to believe that we can repel them
Faith in the years our ancestors taught us
Have the belief that we can protect the wall
Try if they can we will overthrow them
Fight to the last they can never own us
Battle of wills well fight to the last man
Honour our dead so they never fought in vain
Hold our fortune
Avenge the merciful
Hold the great wall
Never fall again

Live to tell our sons

5926,"Yeah The Dragon of Judah
Melatonin Magik producer
Yeah
Mr Magoriums metaphor emporium
Vanglorious warriors with deep space euporia
The Dragon of Judah executed the Lion from Narnia
Im still trying to build Gods army up
The pedagogy tried to call me a communist
And pacify my audience sprinkle them with zombie dust
The icosahedron is a prison for a three headed demon Hip Hop behemoth
Knowledge is needed to argue with the followers of Jesus
Rearranging impossible pieces my quantum is increasing
I am sleeping in a Posturepedic deeply breathing
Dreaming a chakra sightseeing philosophically speaking
I saw Gandhi weakening from not eating
I saw police brutality beatings
I saw the leaders getting into spaceships and leaving
I tried to search for possible meanings
But I couldnt see the logical reasoning
Said survival of the species no Macbook no PCs
No electricity no TV
No emcee battles no Christmas carols
Just international tablets
Brown produce consumed by sick cattle
Bone thin mammals hooked up to intravenous vaccination panels
Collecting contaminated skin samples
This is not natural God damn you
Everybody on the planet dont deserve that not even the animals
You are completely culpable for everything youre supposed to do
Even if its not known to you
The weight of the language I spoke to you
The weight of the letters and the words in the rhymes that I wrote for you
Are so so emotional I dont even know what to do
So Imma leave the choice up to you
Dragon of Judah
I spit like a supernatural computer
Professor Bis Im with the Minister of Intelligence
Hold me down Professor Griff
Minds that produce minds that produce minds like mines
Now everyone want to talk about conspiracy
You shouldve took Channel Zero more seriously
Professor Bis got a ghetto PhD in Chemistry
Professor Griff taught me how to spit it lyrically
Now Im part of the Ministry
Put my name on the blacklist
Cause I dont dickride nobody in the industry
Wheres the fuckin empathy Ive been through so much treachery
Most of the best emcees disrespected me and tried to get the best of me
Never tried to rescue me or help me with the recipe
What do they expect from me
Stressin me questionin me to address the beef
I rep Hip Hop Hip Hop dont rep me
I never got a penny off that Beef DVD
You mean all that money went to QD3
I should have slammed the door in his face
If I was a different nigga Ida been caught a criminal case
The best word to describe what you do to Hip Hop is rape
Cause you dont care about Hip Hops fate
You sit around your tables and say grace
Eatin steak while you live like kings and treat kings like apes
For Michael Jackson money and still on the take
Even Tevin Campbells money the greed is so great
You probably dance around your mansion like Cirque Du Soleil
Everything is paid for you dont have to prorate
I aint hatin Im not hatin Im just sayin
You makin money off the next mans struggle Why you cant pay him
They made millions off them Beef DVDs
But didnt pay KSolo or Eazy E
Its called Blaxploitation
Another one of Canibus paranoid statements thats why Im famous
Im just tryin to tell niggas how the game is
Beef in Hip Hop is just aimless entertainment
If I shoot you Im blameless but if you shoot me you famous
Whats a nigga to do Now aint that the God damn truth
No matter what Hip Hop always lose
Wake the fuck up

Its the Hustlers Ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin
The drama means nothing its part of the game
Catch me in the coup switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win Im full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up but Im back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender make a protein shake
Im like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefnerll tell you he aint got shit on me
The feds watch me icey they cant stop me
Racist pointing at me Look at Niggaraci hello

When he said he didnt want it it was fuck him again
One day he gon regret playing me
Little did I know in a year hed be fucking paying me what could you say to me I

But who the fuck gon tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops cause hes sorry
Fucked up education would ask for reparations
But Im probably just gon go and buy Ferraris vroom

We will hear from the most powerful black man in Americaâtoday
Uhâ Everybody 
I dont thinkâyou heard me Ayo
The most powerfulâblack man in the world
Ayo they ask why I seem so solemn
On the throne between three stone columns
You know the name fuckin up the game no condoms
Everybody got damn first world problem
The truth is inconvenient as nonbelievers
Fearing DACA dreamers instead of FEMA
Bentley Benz or a Beamer Fiji or Aquafina Everybody every goddamn body 
We fuck around and be the next Iwo Jima
The tides risin at the same time like they synchronized
For makin art for makin love for makin Hajj
The home is where the hatred lies they takin lives
But everybody just so saved and sanctified
Then they rely upon we the few defiant ones Everybody every goddamn body 
Communicating in higher forms than Viacom
To dialogue before the roar of the riot horn
I wonder on which side of the lines I belong
Lady Liberty face full of concealer
Im half Masta Killa and half Hugh Masekela
Latrophobia thats a fear of the healer
Kaepernick is an activist yall in fear of the kneeler
Everythings obtuse nothin is obscene
Another young life was lost on live stream
Another great fell from grace in high esteem
Then the clock struck thirteen we in some kind of dream
First Im handling first things decipher what it means
To a planet of earthlings where the question remains
Am I a journal or journalist Herbal eternalist
Olympic tournament level genius author affirmative
Though turnin back and returnin Im not concerned with it
The permanent ink paved the way out the turbulence
My hands against the wall outside a billiards hall
I hear police discussin whether to try and kill us all
I questioned if thatd matter life is like a tree that falls
In the woods even with iPhone footage to see it fall
Great men chose the Papermate Pen or State Pen
The firin pin of a pistol aimed at a playpen
We go from musket to a missile to a revelation Everybody every goddamn body 
Between Heaven and Satan while Im steady creatin
And try to separate the truth from the lies that they told us
I even heard the Soviets the 45th POTUS
That aint the photo they showed us or acceptin the onus
Did they Washington us My condolence to yall diplomas
Heres a bonus the point of view to make things see through
If Im a walking institution Im a HBCU
Face the music keepin it movings one of the great things we do
Yo the devils tryna put together his gang me too
And whether you come from Lagos or Trinidad and Tobago
You can either stay broke or be wealthy as Jeff Bezos
If you just stay woke I was in the dark then day broke Everybody every goddamn body 
Directin questions to my ancestors until they spoke now
Inherently rockin the disco currently
Bars is cryptocurrency hypnotherapy
Shittin on everything 59 64 lyrically
Crystal clarity wonder how I spit so thoroughly
Stay so hungry rappers cant get no mercy Everybody every goddamn body 
Thats the reason any other one who spit wont versus me
Its so lonely in my own class Formerly known as
And the inscription that your headstone has
On my own path in my own world like Disneys
I feel the fuckin system fail just like kidneys
Up steps the one who upsets all carriages
Cause its imperative we change the narrative
Everybody Yeah and thats Thought vs Everybody
Everybody Listen check it out that go to everybody
Everybody Yo I got myself over everybody

Shes crying over me and she was feeling blue I said Slick Rick Repeat 4x 
I was walking down the street just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
362436 I looked to her and I said I need a fix
I asked her the same blahzay blahzay
Her name where she live and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my 1800 beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know youre bugging off the nickname I would be too
But every time she be walking she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond I wouldnt be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over 21 heres the news
Its the hiphop version of the Young Girl Bluez
As the story goes on I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my 1800 beeper
Call me looney crazy psychotic or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
She said come and get me from Mickey Ds at 8
Thats where I work after school pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school but I didnt think it was high
If you saw what I saw then youd know why
You wouldnt believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what Im doing is an oof
Am I robbing a cradle Im very confused
Im stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez
Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age aint nothing but a number thats what ChiAli said
Okay then why dont you get that through the judges head
Proceeding along I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked What do you want She said A pair of earrings
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrived kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew I would be a disgrace
How old are you now to Rhumbareen
I was in shock when they screamed Sixteen
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the neverending saga of the Young Girl Bluez

2590,"What a drag it is getting old
Kids are different today I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though shes not really ill theres a little yellow pill
She goes running for the shelter of her mothers little helper
And it helps her on her way gets her through her busy day
Things are different today I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for her husbands just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns a frozen steak
And goes running for the shelter of her mothers little helper
And two help her on her way get her through her busy day
Doctor please some more of these
Outside the door she took four more
What a drag it is getting old
Men just arent the same today I hear every mother say
They just dont appreciate that you get tired
Theyre so hard to satisfy you can tranquilize your mind
So go running for the shelter of your mothers little helper
And four help you through the night help to minimize your plight
Doctor please some more of these
Outside the door she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those you will get an overdose
No more running for the shelter of a mothers little helper
They just helped you on your way through your busy dying day

Percocet Demerol capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you niggas wanna clap you

Cocaine he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash

Gave him 9 plus 1 dropped a dime on dun

Turned himself in I had to find that dumb

You see my folk we aint no joke
Dont turn this into a murder scene
Im paranoid totin this 44
Been shootin out since my early teens
Ima drop that though grab a M16
You can bring all the niggas you want to bring
Hey I thought you were running things

Click click bang nigga end the discussion
Aint shit sweet cause I seen you was bluffin
I still would spray broad day aint nothing
And let Mac Boney AK do it for me
Im immune to the drama act a fool if you wanna
Lean in my pocket 40 cal by the stomach
He acting like he want it Ima show a nigga somethin
Somebody finna to have to break the news to his momma
I dont tolerate sucka niggas tryin me
Take a special kinda nigga to be fly as me
Similar to 8Ball and MJG been comin out hard since 93

Take a look at my wheels rolling through the south
Still spinning and Im still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp Twist Im a playa still ballin in the game count major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist fuck you bitch
I dont really wanna have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they cant touch that shit
I dont trip niggas pull up
I be lookin proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the Hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Never try to jack you gon lose cause like Cube Ima kill at will
And motherfuckers wanna take my style
Cause niggas out here know Im only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let yall niggas play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin 8 Ball MJG
Twista bitch and I from the Chi
With my Memphis connect and I aint gon lie
We be specializing in only coming up with dope shit
And pulling up with cold wheels thats fly
Still drink still blow then I creep through the hood real slow
Ride when I bump Kamikaze shit while I scream look at my grill ho

Gold grill smile wiling out up in the VIP
The club close at 5 oclock we pulling up around three
Woodgrain wheel gripping Cinderella sipping
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken
Money players keep me gleamin like Im Willie Beamen
Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She scheming dreaming wishing she can be my number one
Forever young mama I just wanna have some fun
Dont try to ever take my cash from me
You might as well jump off a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like thats my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin back at perpetrators
We dont discriminate well hurt now and hurt you later
But I aint worried Ill smoke one of you fucking haters
And now Im higher than gators on the refrigerator
Down south Memphis Tenn pimpin gotta rep it
The dirt I did under the rug where a nigga swept it

Huthut one huthut two
Big titties big butt too
Fufuck with them real niggas
Who dont tell niggas what they up to

Riring finger where the rock is
Thethese hoes couldnt test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Mamamad bitches we dont fuck with
I dont fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky

Oh if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only bad bitches only
Rich niggas only independent bitches only
Boss niggas only thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side only
Yeah I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when thats over then Im first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought Goddamn this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah lowkey or maybe highkey
I been peeped that you like me you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me
I mean it doesnt take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean she say Im obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah thats right I like my girls BBW
Yeah type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh Yeah you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The badass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you oh
Thats cause I believe in something I stand for it

All my goons so overzealous
Im from Hollygrove the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake but Im stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet not fuck with her surfboard surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Dont have my money Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy treat beef like sirloin
Im talkin bout runnin in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me masked up they got smaller guns
Aint thinkin bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga
I mean brazy my nigga
That money talk I just rephrase it my nigga
Blood gang take the b off behavior my nigga
For reals if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean poppoppop then I take off
Nigga now you see me nigga now you dont

Sixteen in a clip one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me

Show me where yall re at where the ki at
Sleep eat shit and pee at park your 3 at
Spark like Vietnam tell your mom through the intercom
UPS maam sign here send a bomb
Leave that bitch roasted and toasted like a chestnut
And if I run out of milk for cereals I leave her breasts cut
Got this pitbull and I feed him fresh guts sick em Cujo
Steal your bitch and dick the culo
Slam yo ass and I dont know a lick of judo
Fly to PR stick Menudo
Come back cop a 6 with twodo
Cop a brick from you know who Julio Crew
From Washington Heights in jail I had niggas washin my Nikes
Now Im squashin the mic extortionist type
Harsh with a knife
Im flossin yo ice on some Bronx shit tonight

Cannibalism is livin in my metabolism
Givin em spasms and aneurisms at baby baptisms
Thats all my thugs thinkin bout drinkin your blood
Boriquans love flooded rugs bloody and bloated mugs
Even the reverend can get a severing when Im beheading
The Armageddon is deading demons Jesus in heaven
Goin back to spiritual ritual times
What you gon find shiftings of Satan in critical bind
Nevermind I do that often Ive risen often
Bust out my coffin Im a livin abortion
Battled the Devil and deaded his demons
Trained other beings to be in his different levels of Hell
Still screamin
Seein bodies bloody and babies bloated corroded
Know the Chinese exploded
Know they run with Gotti who know it check it 
I never run I never ran the fattest motherfuckin man
I roll with Cuban makin junk to jams
Thats all Im knowin and Im never kneed
All on your soul I feed Im lettin punk motherfuckers bleed
Fuckin with me better hide yo seed
Better think twice before you ride on me
Cause Imma lift your weight
Then Im droppin you in the incinerator
Then Im hittin the hospital and poppin two in the incubator
Thats how we do it pana hardcore no more googoo gaga
Oh Im sorry papa was you the dada

Fuck with me and youll get stuck quick fuck you suck dick hah

7270,"Yo yeah aight after this particular practice run
Ima practice both verses after this I want you to find a spot
Thats close to when the beat drops to the rewind point locate point
You aint gotta be on that all night this the soundtrack
Yo yeah check it
Okay alright huh okay
The other night I was up at Farmers politicking with some Bloods
They told me Yo L in the streets you aint getting no love
And ever since the Xs and the Jiggas came out
My niggas aint trying to the hear that smooth shit you talk about
Whats up with that cat Canibus Son played you out
Why you didnt answer back correctly fuck was that about
As I sip on some Henny and try to explain some things
About the life of a legend and all the drama it brings
Been gone a long time had a lot of shit on my mind
I decided I dont want to reach my goal if it means losing my shine
Streets is hiphop and Im hiphop so the streets is mine
Balling as long as you been living thats a long time
Hard to stay hungry when your pockets are so fat
You hit a hot one in every city on the map
And niggas keep sleeping and you keep coming back
You know better than the gat but niggas still wanna clap
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey hey
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey
Some say L thats cool but see times have changed
Niggas got red bandanas and the grill in the range
That gold shit is dead niggas rock platinum chains
Trade OE for Henny Colt 45 for champagne
Hustling niggas found they way into the game
Extorting all these socalled ballers with big names
And you gotta have a squad cause running from Def aint safe
I know you living good but aint no smile up on our face
Im like a villain Im representing on my lyrics
And force feed the world even if they dont want to hear it
As far as Canibus go my man is hitting his exbroad
Im getting head from his new piece
While 20 gangbangers applaud you came up with that bullshit
Some heads sucked it up then you dropped that garbage album
And totally fucked it up I coulda told ya I knew your moms
From the afterhours spot when I used to be up in Canada
With the dreads on a black block before you dick rode Lost Boyz
For a ticket our to Jersey but being the man I am
I tried to show ya mercy I coulda told the World
The way ya label hates your guts
And how me and Wyclef got together to set you up
And how he gave me half your budget dont believe me look it up
Your AR promotion niggas they helped me hook it up
I hate to be responsible for destroying your career
A onehit wonder huh
No wonder you disappeared I coulda told the world
You get your lyrics from the internet
Then spit em word for word
Like you really a rap vet how you take metaphors from books
And put em in your rhyme and how you really from Canada
And you been fronting all this time
I heard your second album that shit is garbage too
LL Cool J and I did this to you
On that note he said
Yo L you the man I said peace one love
And drove off in the Lex Land
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey hey
It feels so good to be back where I belong
The streets is where I belong
They had me locked down much too long
Hey
Yea nigga the jig is up nigga huh ha
You know what Im saying All that bullshit you was talking
Dont mean shit you finish now

The vanguard award is in my motherfucking living room
You know what I mean come get that shit fuck what

Both arms Ima get another one nigga
You know what Im saying this LL you know how I get down

No choice but to adapt to the ghetto so he adapts to the ghetto

And shorty had no love for his sister
Cuz his sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her

Plus he was good at handlin coke so Jose liked him
Problem was he was pitchin for the dudes down the street Who 
You know TJ Big Boo and Malik Word 
Malik is a killer Boo is a killer Yep 
TJ well hes just another nigga
But despite the fact what they didnt like the fact
That he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And being that he was a pitcher here in the winter air What happened 
They set it up to get him there and hit him there Damn 
But shorty was smart
So before they got to load and spark
He said hold up my heart Hold up hold up Please
Then he said please look up in my bag Look 
Theres cook up in my bag its all good up in my bag Here 
And theres more where that came from
I get it from Jose believe me theres more where that came from
Yeah he had em lost and the game won won 
They let him go yeah thinkin he would let em know What 
Where Jose was keepin that heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that Bout that 
And we all know Jose bout that Bout that 
Next thing you know he seen Jose slouch back What 
In the chair like Theres no way out that Nope 
He said Shoot em Imma blow they house back Back 
Next day he sent the two way out town And 
And somebody blew they house down Damn 
Jose think shorty on his side
But he dont know shorty on his side Word 
So shorty called Jose like Listen Listen

So we met up Met up it was a set up
Guess who TJ Malik and Boo sped up Wow

Is proved to be wrong
Then I guess Im a miracle

Had to hustle boy Im tryna touch a toy
Im tryna fuck these LA streets up
Think its safe to say that I did it
Look nigga uh
All black everything and my diamonds all love like Vera Wang
Look blue rags in the south of France
Theres some things in life that wont ever change
Me Im a nigga thats supposed to ball
Cause Im a street survivor and they mold us wrong
Before rap we was rollin stones
I drove a Cutlass coupe would cop a quarter zone
Front of the buildin on my mobile phone
Im thinkin pace myself cause you could overdose
Not on the drugs but the life you chose
By hangin niggas I dont like the row
No such thing as they might parole
They putting cameras up in microphones
They got me sandwiched in I want a nicer home
They know I take the risk I dont know right from wrong
Plus any given day you might be gone
No clich where the lines get drawn
Come on the block its a riot zone
For the loot niggas stoop into pirate mode
Paint with less strokes and divide you dawg
Guns get drawn niggas lives get lost
Never was entitled had to fight for raw

One button where the roof went
TMZ takin shots say cheese for the news clips
Dope boys and them boosters
Gangbangers and hoopers
My style is inclusive the streets is abusive
But its life my nigga wanna survive gotta shoot shit
Hella thick skin never bruise quick
Yellow wrists and some 7speed shit
I talk to you on some suck a D shit

My understandin on a level kinda different my nigga
Every time I drop the city a feel it
Every time you hate you gotta be kiddin
Every time I pull up the foreign is kitted
And I cant even really walk through the Beverly Center
Hudson jeans on aint the regular denim

2549,"I was thinking about you guys yesterday Now Ive been here three times before and I think I understand a little bit of how you feel about some things Its none of my business how you feel about some other things and I dont give a damn about how you feel about some other things But anyway I tried to put myself in your place and I believe this is how I would feel about San Quentin
San Quentin youve been livin hell to me
Youve hosted me since nineteen sixty three
Ive seen em come and go and Ive seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why
San Quentin I hate every inch of you
Youve cut me and have scarred me through and through
And Ill walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman you cant understand
San Quentin what good do you think you do
Do you think Ill be different when youre through
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin youve been living hell to me
Thank you very much One more time Maybe before we do it though if any of the guards are still speaking to me can I have a glass of water
laughter applause

Somewhere out of this world stranded on Uranus
With coke and a dollar bill stems and crack capsules
Take a blast boo booby trap a cruise its natural
Like soybean burn like a laser beam
My vaccine I shoot it firm and it connects like sideburns
The segment rap fragment
Comes together like magnets
Attract heads captured like Dragnet
Going through mad phases of all ages
Killa Beez locked the fuck up behind cages
The Genovese swallowed this line and caught a freeze
Press caller ID for me to quote more degrees
The fortune teller tuck a sleeping gas umbrella
Award winning dining in the back of Marabella
Now who dont believe that cash must rule
I dont eat meat I slap blood out of Perdue

Mega powder dripping from they nose
Fucking Jet magazine bitches with wide pussy pose
Centerfold the whole night deadly venom horror snake bites
Only Built 4 Cuban Link kings who shoot dice
Holding money bags convertible Benz with feathered bags
With the mongoose your mans got two seeds down in Baghdad
You onionhead niggas spread out and parlay
Yo Rae these icksdays get crashed with ash trays
I pull stings like guitar strings down in Spain
Im so hyped jakes labeled god Crack cocaine

3652,"Home by the Sea
Home by the Sea
Home by the Sea
Home by the Sea
Creeping up the blind side shinning up the wall
Stealing through the dark of night
Climbing through a window stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces putting them away
Something doesnt feel quite right
Help me someone let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea
Coming out the woodwork through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows but no substance in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sigh and they moan
Help us someone let us out of here
Living here so long on this Earth

Thats the last thing we wanna do
We dont wanna scare anybody
Never said it was fair but still I never knew fear
Not in a million years could you tell me that Id be here
I just hopped off that lear my life on another tier
Lifting glasses for cheers keep that hating out my ear
From country living to country skipping this would drive you crazy
Check the rate that they pay me a giant could never slay me
Money never a maybe but never forgot my roots
I heard that the top is lonely I wonder if its the truth
So Im just climbing paid off rhyming now Im shining could be blinding
Aint too much real left but right here is where you could find it
This that new classic aint this what you needed
Im what amazing look like now recognize it when you see it
Not where I wanna be but Im far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls I dont answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Aint no going back now
Dont know where Im at now
Aint no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone
Ive been counted out Ive been stepped on
I was wide awake and got slept on
I had everything and then lost it
Worked my ass off Im exhausted
All this talking about me just talk about me
Im here now they cant walk around me
Im dedicated flow elevated
Tell every hater hope you never play it said Ill never make it
Im celebrating and Im never quitting no resignation
I took desperate measures out of desperation
Im the fresh face with no expiration
I know pressure make diamonds so I threw em off in this chain
And when its all on the line Im who you want in the game
Cause Im gon get it and thats for sure
Cant be like yall thats a nogo
International while yall local got this locked up just like popo
Every beat get ate thats ocho
Wont lose oh no thats Yoko
Been up and down like low lows
Still make my own on my solo
Had to be here to believe it
Think like winners to perceive it
Had to let you know that I mean it
If I speak it and say keep it
This flow thats genius
Just think about it what I think about it
If I didnt live it wont ink about it
Married to the money put a ring around it what
Not where I wanna be but Im far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls I dont answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Aint no going back now
Dont know where Im at now
Aint no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone
And everything aint the way I planned it
But when the smoke clears Im the last standing
This lifestyle can be so demanding
But I take off like a plane and aint never landing
Not where I wanna be but Im far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls I dont answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone

I love you for the first draft you
All the technology on Earth cant improve
No special effects and no Santa Claus
Uncut acoustic and analog
A lifetime measured in breaths
The face is a mirror that the heart reflects
And when the eyes meet they directly connect
And thats what you call true special effects
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again
I dont want to watch your life in pictures
Im trying to be right there with ya
Well be so rich at the end of all of this
We can scroll through memories without any filter
Im trying to share life as it comes
No timeline from the night to the sun
Crme de la crme and the crust and the crumbs
Type of love you cant type with your thumbs
Let me not hear your voice in a speaker
Im tryna feel your breath when it leaves ya
Message received you best to believe
Your real life friend is requesting to see you
Im here to watch your story unfold
I dont really want to only be told
Everything I hold is pressed to my chest
Thats what you call special effects yes 
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again just to see your face
Staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
Longing to be near you because life is way too short
I traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
Just to see your face again just to see your face again
Into me you see I see
Inherent in here I hear
I give fidelity free
See my peers appear my dear
Into me you see I see
Inherent in here I hear my dear
Just to see your face again just to see your face 
Groove to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words what
In other words huh
Move to the beat that free your mind state
Put your heartbeat on vibrate
In other words what

And they say Im on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
Its heaven for a hustler no graveyards

The bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
And when dealin with Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin is not just the name of this jam
But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers thats known to break em off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent front and back glass got tint
Tryin to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools cant hold us
Every chance we get we hittin up the rollers
Comin up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin bean pies
Or the bootleg tshirt of the month
With U Cant Touch This on the front
Im out to get rich
Cause life aint nothin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didnt know Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
Im out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
Cause Im ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch cause Im steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Bustin caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause Im gettin major
Fuck PacTel move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Dont drink 8Ball cause St Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad tempers are flarin
Cause they got a few bitches starin
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss em
Out cause I just dont trust em
And if you tell on me Im bombin on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Since onetime so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
Cause Im rollin on rims
Eating soul food neckbones from MMs
Grubbin like a motherfucker
Greasyass lips now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin
When I hit a left on Ruthelen What up loc
Dont you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke Get in nigga
Ill take you to the pad soon
Went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bones house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob aint nothin but tramps
For hoes lickin nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I dont want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash
I said Yeah but I dont play sex
Without puttin on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night no longer steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life

With a Backwood clinched between my dentals way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin rentals in front of Centennial
Remedial thoughts never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic fuck bitches ride around bouncin shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck to dishraggin bitches
That was hard to fuck I came up it was hardly luck
Just left Compton and I aint have to use my AK
What a day what a day
Back when my drivers license was babyfaced and triflin
I made my way through crisis I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens I made you hate the vibrant
You cant escape the tyrant you cant relate where Ive been
In 98 my problem actin too grown and shit
Cappin at bitches yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me thats on me
Raise up nigga you are not the homie
Bitch Im wellconnected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin with Tetris if your block neglectin your ki
Every day I wake up with my face up to my Father
Makin sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my green and stuff and double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality my dj vu done caught up
Bitch Im brought up with the homies thats on me
247 Kendrick reverend these cold streets
Dog we live by it die by it then reincarnate
And if Game told me Drive by it I raise AK
Aint no shame on it cry about it fuck that I play

Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It aint no better one son it aint no tellin me nothin
Nigga thats Chuck Doc Dre and K the legacys done BLAOW

I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella
There I go give me a minute nigga
Bout to hit a home run K Dot grab the pennant nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton trap late night Jay Leno them

Straight outta Compton 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE motherfucker

Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full I quick pull no more slangin 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with I ate yall on the corner

Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock yes I did
Walked to Compton hot pocket full of rocks yes I did
Skipped class yes I did whooped niggas ass yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag thats on Bloods

Ha ha ha this time its over boy
This is me and you head to head lets go
Here we go beat down round two
Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you face to face head to head
Mic to mic I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn Beats nitro
Lyrics weak say goodnight yo
Star Trek shades man cut the joke
Lets get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pit bull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr Pitiful
Heres some mouthwash G
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap C
AUSE youre riding me
TODD junior Moe Dee
Stop biting chewing swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son I need jock relief
Heres a toothpick now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it Yeah finished Burp 
Now let a real man go to work
Cause Im a whip you like your daddy beat ya like a baby
Sic ya like a dog dropping lyrics with rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause youre nothing but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
Im a treat ya like a hooker punk change your clothes
Put you on the streets in with ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and Ill keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
Youre trying to come off and dont know how to come
Youre young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
Ill do you with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
My lyrical beat down will leave ya in a coma
Cause you cant hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue youre out of your league
Youre running out of gas and youre tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause hes petro
Take youre whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies tears or violins
Get your black suits cause I aint smiling
Im shooting the gift of gab brother youre ripped in half
Soon as the mic is passed you wont live to laugh
If theres laughter Ill get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So whos got no style look at your profile
You cant dance cant dress and youre so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your game plan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you aint got a chance in hell
Youll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one one too often
Came with a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they wont show ya
When I finish your mama wont know ya
Cause Ima rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read He had no win
So RIP Rest in peace ripped em
DID dead indeed did em
An HIT hitman so whatcha hit him with 
A rhyme silencer I hit him with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
If mama said knock me out come do it
You cant win and that scratch knew it
Ima send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
Youre out of here over finished all in
And Marley Marl cant save you from fallin
Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn Another dumb move
You cant go hard youre just soso Todd
Im that type of guy Oh my God
Its gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marley hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because Im a rock up L
Low life loser life like luna
Lackadaisical listless luna
Tic liver lifeless living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league lard larcenist liar
Label ledger left the leper liar
Bull lull lateral learning
Laps languid latent lurking
Languish language local logo
Light laboring limited loco
Now LLs a laughing stock
Cause I lit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now youre down to a broken L
Your records aint hot and your shows dont sell
Yo tell em how you fell L Hard as hell 
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it whos your daddy
Kill em kill em
Make you say Daddy I dont want none 
I did em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the to the to the get him out of here
Yeah
So for all those hip hop fans out there that really know what time it is
Anybody that wants to see us get this thing going on headtohead Kool Moe Dee versus LL
Put a little pressure on him cause the boy aint got no heart
Cause he knows what time it is
And anybody out there that dont know what time it is remember
I never said the brother couldnt make a good record
But when it comes to a battle we gotta go headtohead on them lyric tip
And when it come to lyrics he cant hang

He jumped out the window cause he couldnt sit still
Juliet was waiting with a safety net
He said Dont bury me cause Im not dead yet
Why dont you tell me bout the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why dont you show me
Cause Ive tried and Ive tried
And Im still mystified
I cant do it anymore and Im not satisfied
Well I remember when the lights went out
And I was trying to make it look like it was never in doubt
She thought that I knew and I thought that she knew
So both of us were willing but we didnt know how to do it
Why dont you tell me bout the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why dont you show me
Cause Ive tried and Ive tried
And Im still mystified
I cant do it anymore and Im not satisfied
Well I was down under the covers in the middle of the night
Trying to discover my left foot from my right
You can see those pictures in any magazine
But whats the use of looking when you dont know what they mean
Why dont you tell me bout the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance

Young trick in my face asking me if I claim sets
And heres this other fool with dreads growin from his head
He tryin to tell me bout some shit Farrakhan said
I try to listen cause 8ball aint the one to knock it
But I cant hear over the echo from my empty pocket
Instead of sweating me fool sweat Chuck D
Cause I been true to playa shit since 83
Southern funkadelic preacher Im here to reach ya
Dont be so prejudiced and let my holy words teach ya
I never rap about sets cause I aint been through that
Even though a nigga did dirt and packed straps
I dont do what you do and you dont see what I see
Therefore we could not be the same do you feel me

Peace to KRS but heres my philosophy

You might find some other way to pass your time
It aint bout where you from its bout what you do
And doin wrong gon make clues so trouble gon stick to you
True blue pimp shit is hard to break
But playa hatin bustas put the icin on the cake
Hate to see they own homies with a few ends
And still wonder why they cant get no dividends
A man aint who he say he is
If he gotta give false information bout what he had and how he live
And dont shit but the truth set you free
So trick stop all that lyin get those shackles way from me
He who tells the first lie gets the first smack
A chain react on the mack flossin fake facts
A freaky naked hoe makes no record deal
Perpetrators get for real

But in time I came to find people are blind
To the fact I dont give a fuck about your thoughts
Motherfuck the radio and fuck the magazine talk
Walk with the playa down the highway of what I say
Hear what I say is just another way to make me paid
Instead of gettin sprayed or runnin from police
I am in the studio smoked out bustin rhymes
And jealous hoes male and female
Been givin a nigga hell now that I am 
Jealous of the fact that my mack is not an act
Instead of packin gats Im strapped with my DATs
And all my homies slang dope for a livin
Or livin in a prison cause they couldnt fade the system
I miss them but still I gots to get up on my

Fiending and Im craving for the freedom of creativity that comes
From escaping into being undertaking the allegiance down under
And the way these lyrics be leaving you
Take you to a realm of astounding wonder
On the threshold of a less known way to get goin on a super rhyme style highway
Window let em see there to appear but I really dont care Im a do this my way
Today find a new way to play with a few cadences Im a parlay
This space and Ill still pace wait til the verses reveal they self then Im on my way
Many thoughts Ill lay
Many me cloned
MCs talk but they all are sayin
The exact same thing
The exact same things
And hooks the exact same way
And I wanna take a nap when Im hearin that crap
Just getting on past his pay
Im a make a new path through the math
Lets see how it sounds when I rap this way

If you listen close it could alter
Your perception of what you think dope is
Im a free mind and will leave you incarcertated
All sedated
Get a clear mind when the fog is faded
In the days of the sleep we all awaken
Maybe then you could check out what I saw

6955,"Tres Leches Triboro Trilogy Lyrics
Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned Wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Wake you up and as I stare in your
Wake you up and as I stare in your
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember P the one you got your whole style from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got your rhyme style from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember P the one you got your rhyme style from
Yo its the P cut and scratched
Yo disperse from off this who the culprits
That claim to be the newest rappin bullshit
My rhymes get Ruger endorsements
My song boost Intratec sales through the ceiling
Lets talk with guns convos til the police come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
Burst macs like its Hamburger Hill for real
Its Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on
My outfit stuck on some wild out shit all about it
We move gambit through the overcrowded
Forthwith pull out long fifths extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disc
Me and the cliqueah sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin write a new banger
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
Or the HAVOC nigga
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got the technique from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember me the one you got your freestyle from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Deck I told yall Protect Ya Neck
Im Rebel INS your highness cut and scratched
Fake one take one no ultimatum face one
Theres no escape from
Straight from the grain come the great one
My blade swung decapitate your snake head
Slit your snake tongue make one false maneuver you a mystery
Unsolved the mob that revolves automatically involved
Musclebound sounds surround commercial thugs
Rock turtledove Bowery suits and purple gloves
Me and you can have some fun make it a blast
You couldnt take the impact with steel shoulder pads
Blood for blood veteran covered in mud
Wounded in the midst of war still tradin slugs gettin major love
Way above you newcomers
I come thunderin with the heat of two summers
When I enter the zone move mountains with the presence alone
Before the words rip through the microphone
Chrome dipped lyrics are known to split stone
You privatize home in but cant seem to clone
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Pun the one you bit your whole shit from
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Pun I snatched away the moon and blew away the sun
I wake you up and as I stare in your face you seem stunned
Remember Pun the one with over a thousand guns
You start to suffer cut and scratched
Yo Big Punishers ready
Prodigy Deck and me QB Shaolin and Bronx trilogy
Lyrically hazardous for your wealth swing on your worlds piece
Foil your plans boil your grams take your shine
Fold all your hands spoil your mans make him mine
Take all you made call you gay on Hot 97
Drop by your dwellin got the nueve right behind your melon
Aint no tellin when the bullets behind the trigger
I do it to live niggas and Pulitzer Prize winners
You wouldnt survive nigga if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear showin your whole vocal
Who told you you could roll through
My lyrics practically rose you from the grave like The Crows do
I told you a long time ago dont ever fuck me
Cause if I leave you half dead consider yourself very lucky
Very ugly from the face up leave you laced up
Joey Krillz Pros Cuban Link Triple Seis WHAT
Soon you start to suffer
The RZA
The Inspectah Deck
Yo its the P
The Punishers ready

5111,"What you want is an unexpected approach
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence
Until you have a chance to assess
The situation you are confronted
Approach to danger dont move
Its hard to predict what would happen next 
Oh shit he has a gun Drop the gun
You couldve prevented a tragedy
You can approach but the danger light is blinkin
A selfdesctruct button is activated when Im thinkin
This is a tribulation the weak is judged
The prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge
I took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme
Theyre seein doubles of me but it wasnt a dream
One vision was of life the other was death
And life didnt give a fuck if death took your last breath
So you burn in my pit that I call hell
Where you got sent because your shit dont sell
My twentytwenty was blurry from the smoke
Of the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didnt choke
I started doing them I kept on doing them two of them
Shoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
But fuck it they can approach to the danger
If you can be seen you can be hit
If you can be hit you can be killed
Hes over there Shoot him 
Fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangler
Out run the shot of a gun when the games up
Murder in the first degree but its worse to be
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
With everybody thinkin of death
I kept workin to be one of the last niggas left
So many people lookin for hope they broke
Without checkin the fingerprints on a motherfuckers throat
A heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me
So figure to see the DEAD
Bodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary
So its very necessary to carry
Ammunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution
Before Dre goes off
And starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the
Anger for the real nigga when I approach to danger
Approach the motherfuckin danger
Come back to hell and see me some time 
This is it yall 
Final approach to danger death destruction around every corner
Another dead body and you wanna keep runnin
But even the rain turns black
All you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight
No prison nobody makes bail
Everybody gotta go but see it aint no jail
Think about death takin your last breath
Heart beatin like a motherfucker like it aint no time left
With so many ways to stay up I gotta get mine
Even though they wanna make a crime yo
Of bein real a federal letter in the beginnin
Because of the release of Fuck the Police
Fuck it I approach the danger
Cause I dont give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
Cause in the long run we all die

Han llegado a ser una miseria insoportable para la gente
Pero hay unas vendepatrias engredos que todava creen
En una sociedad de antes donde los artistas
Fuimos bestias de trabajo para la industria
Ese sueo se ha acabado
Y ahora nos encontramos despiertos en la hora de revolucin
Porque no podemos llamar esto un movimiento si toda la propiedad
Intelectual pertenece a los que nos oprimen
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Motherfucker
Ya te dije
Que se ha acabado la mierda
Nos compraron el alma barata
Hasta la sangre nos sacan atacan
Y con un contrato te atrapan
Pero primero me matan hermano
Porque prefiero morir
Peleando que ser esclavo
Industria sucia
Toma lluvia de acido
Comprende la historia del hiphop clsico
Cuando controlan el negocio y la cultura
La msica se vuelve en comercial basura
Y la reina latina pintada como gallina
Es mas que bailarina o puta en la esquina
Es abogada profesora madre soldada
Y carga nuestro futuro cuando est embarazada
Mira nuestra gente crucificada
Y la manera desgraciada
Que estos perros no hablan de nada
Ms que fiestas y riqueza
Que la gente no tiene
As que ahora vas a ver
La violencia que viene
Un movimiento de verdad ha empezado
Dejamos el imperio corrupto descuartizado
Golpe de estado disparando al presidente
Es hora de revolucin nuevamente
Un movimiento de la gente se ha juntado
Peleando liberando los pueblos encarcelados
Golpe de estado y seramos independiente
Es hora de revolucin nuevamente
Dale llega llega el espaol sin bacteria
This aint that mueve la cadera its that usa tu cabeza
Tu mente tu almendra No pa que baile pa que aprenda

Tu camina por el barrio y rincn de la prenda
Vive la prensa
Veneno el guerrillero ya llego
Con el inmortal dicha el gobierno se asusto
FBI CIA gotta pay to get played
Out here in the United States no me interesa ser el Rey
La voz de los Latinos camino sin correr
So wassup

Fuego al firmar te dicen como tirar tu flow

Ustedes son burros
Que venden el culo por el reggaetn
Abre los ojos cojo el presidente les enseo
Como le rompo el cuello al pendejo
Solo con mi can
Yo soy la epidemia la saga las nueve plagas

In your circle dont mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
I plead the fifth Hell no and No your honor
So the streets honor me humble believe Im on it
I grab my momma Im headed to a different genre
They couldnt understand me now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy crack greed homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight nothing recent
But Ima call the state for back pay they owe me grievance

5923,"I got ice in my veins blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain days are the same
You keep the sunshine save me the rain
I search but never find hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but Im cursed so never mind
And its worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on mafucker
Cause all this bullshit just made me strong mafucker
So I pick the world up and Ima drop it on your fuckin head
Yeah

And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker
Im gone motherfucker Im gone
Uh

Just hope youre heavensent and youre hellproof
I I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they cant wipe off
Huh my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and thats a word from the wise
Served to survive murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

Oops time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes got em cookin boy
This crooked mind of mine got em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and buttfucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame that aint what
I came to claim but the game aint gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another Ima make these fuckin haters believe it
I swear to God wont spare the rod
Im a man of my word so your fuckin heads better nod
Or Ima fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your headll lie
Permanently bitch its beddybye
This world is my Easter egg yeah prepare to die
My head is swole my confidence is up this stage is my pedestal

Yall motherfuckers ready for NWA Well get the fuck up

Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say

Used to be hard now youre just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michelle
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming thats why I went solo
And kept on stompin
While yall motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now Im making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes Who you foolin
Yall niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boys on your team so youre losing
Ayy yo Dre stick to producing
Calling me Arnold but you been a dick
EazyE saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But Im a man and aint nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkkas Most
You could yell all day but you dont come close
Cause you know Im the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles but you still got one to go
With the LENCH MOB
And yall disgrace the CPT
Cause youre getting fucked out your green
By a white boy with no Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Damn it feels good to see people on it
The bigger the cap the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punkass villain
Youre getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Rens shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho so
I couldnt stop you from getting ganked
Now lets play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube it wasnt worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair Nah cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gangbanged by your manager fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and highheels
So dont believe what Ren say
Cause hes going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you Toby
Used to be my homie now you act like you dont know me
Its a case of divide and conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton but you moved to Riverside
So dont front MC Ren
Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It aint my fault one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline
Now youre getting done get getting done
Now youre getting done get getting done
Now youre getting done without Va Va Va Va Vaseline
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again Ill be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch fucking your homeboys you little maggot
EazyE turned faggot
With your manager fella
Fucking MC Ren Dr Dre and Yella
But if they were smart as me
EazyE would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light em up burn em up flame on
Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga what you thinking bout
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
Cause you cant be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget whos a punk too
Tryin to fuck me but Id rather fuck you

no Vaseline Now youre getting done without Vaseline Now
2568,"Just My Imagination Running Away with Me Lyrics
Oooh
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself Youre such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to you
But it was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Ooh Soon 
Soon well be married and raise a family Oh yeah 
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children maybe three
I tell you I I I can visualize it all
This couldnt be a dream for too real it all seems
But it was just my imagination once again
Runnin away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Evry night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord hear my plea
Dont ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die hmm
Her love is heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesnt even know me
Just my imagination Once again
Runnin away with me oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Ive never met her but I cant forget her
Just my imagination Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Runnin away with me ooh
Just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Shes never hard to find Just my imagination 
Shes always on my mind Runnin away with me 
",with me Tell you it was just my imagination Runnin away with me Evry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord hear my plea Dont ever let another take her love from me Or I will surely die hmm Her love is heavenly When her arms enfold me I hear a tender rhapsody But in reality She doesnt even know me Just my imagination Once again Runnin away with me oh Tell you it was just my imagination Runnin away with me Ive never met her but I cant forget her Just my imagination Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah Runnin away with me ooh Just my imagination Runnin away with me Shes never hard to find Just my imagination Shes always on my mind Runnin away with me,Just My Imagination Running Away with Me Lyrics Oooh Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by I say to myself Youre such a lucky guy To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true Out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to you But it was just my imagination Runnin away with me It was just my imagination Runnin away with me Ooh Soon Soon well be married and raise a family Oh yeah A cozy little home out in the country With two children maybe three I tell you I I I can visualize it all This couldnt be a dream for too real it all seems But it was just my imagination once again Runnin away

The veggietable of contents
I give you a parsnippet
When then DJ start to Spinach
I put the songs on wax
They want a couple pears pairs 
Search da barrel for bad apples
But none is there
Now I plant seeds and bury the bone
In different area codes
On blackberry
Macintosh
Or windows
Easy a peel appeal like bananas
The man with the plantain
Keepin it organic
Over deez golden beets
I yam so sweet
A different grain
Im known to rice on a beach
U could say Im a fungi
Party in a plush room
You feelin blue in ya small world
Like mushrooms
It aint hard to tell a smurf from a Gargamel
Father Sun Tzu strategy behind my art of sale
Protect ya Necktarine
Cuz all these crabs in a bucket
Just wanna see ya record sales Plummet

They say its for the love and the Passionfruit
Thats when I say get deez nuts
We got checks to cashews
I got a academia in macadamia
Neva like pimpartichoke slappin ladies up
I metaphor met her for pickles in the jar
Or I might blaze grapes in her face
Still raisin raising the bar
And you granola emcees cant handle those
I see cabbage folks
They see Cantelope
Green Machine like McHale Kevin
Im chile chill
Red is familiar
My name ring a bell pepper
Stalking ya ears
You might turn corn
Same rappers turn pop
When the heat turn on
When the flame turn orange
Time to do dat shit
If its still hard to be leave
I prune that shit
Pomegranate dont panic
Im the cherry on top of the Ice Cream
I squash beef
Thank you berry much

Unsyncopated soul piercin earlobes and egos

Lame game plain Jane MCs cant approach these

To drive you guide you provide you
With the real joints ahem I clear my throat of phlegm

To rid the game of nuisance

Youre dirt on my windshield so Im turnin on my wipers

No other rapper is near me now
And all you perpetrators shall fear me now

Respect the Architect in this division
Rhymes written to be hittin like antiproton collisions

Like a wiseguy with my New York lean
Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate
From state to state universal be the orals that I create
Top notch and on lock like Sentry opponents could never tempt me
Samplin my style like an Akai S950 and still cant get with me
While I spread this verbal plague like bubonic
Conductin phonics like the Philharmonics

She had been sick sick so very long
But she heard bout Jesus was passin by
So she joined the gathering throng
And while she was pushing her way through
Someone asked her What are you trying to do
She said If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know Ill be made whole
She cried Oh Lord Oh Lord and whoa Lord Oh Lord 
And oh oh Lord and whoa Lord Oh Lord 
Said If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know Ill be made whole
And whoa she spent her money here and there
Until she had no had no more to spare
The doctors theyd done all they could
But their medicine would do no good
When she touched Him the Savior didnt see
But still he turned around and cried Somebody touched me
She said It was I who just wanna touch the hem of your garment
I know Ill be made whole right now
She stood there cryin Oh Oh Lord Oh Oh Lord 
And oh oh Lord and whoa Lord Oh Lord

Its like Im in the dirt diggin up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
All it takes is one song on the radio youre
Right back on it reminding me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But Im coming for closure
Dont suppose an explanation Im owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh you thought it was over
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
Well Ive never recovered
But tonight bet you that what youre
Bout to go throughs tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges Mind saying Let it go fuck this
Hearts saying I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad
And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
Thought some time would pass and Id forget it Forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
May be gone but hes not forgotten
And dont think cause hes been out the picture so long that Ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya
Youre wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold
Have you any idea the shit that Ive gone through
Feelings I harbor All this pentup resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how Im doing
Letters you dont respond to em
Fuck it Im coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on ya
Poof then Im gone voosh
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
Ive been drivin around your side of this town
Like nine frickin hours and fortyfive minutes now
Finally I found your new address park in your drive
Feel like Ive been waitin on this moment all of my life
And its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and Im duckin on the side of your house
See its sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya but I aint here for your empathy
I dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
Its revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potentialI peeked Haha 
Continue to peep still bent low then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
All the way round to the back porch
Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
You dont plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue
Gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Ironys spectacular huh Now whos a faggot you punk
And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
Its just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it
Were in a car right nowwait here comes my favorite lyric
Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
Hows this for a publicity stunt This should be fun
Last album now cause after this youll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell
Bitch I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since youre in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits time is quite near
Hope we dont get stopped no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
As cops appear in my drivers side mirror
Oh God Police Agh 
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
New plan Stan
Slim Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car
Well gotta go almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro its for you Slim this is for him
And Frank Ocean oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
Im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
Im your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope its hopeless Im that denial that youre hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
Backs to the wall Im stackin up all them odds
Toilets clogged yeah cause Im talkin a lot of shit but Im backin it all up
But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
Im the ringing in your ears
Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
Grab for some water
But Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
Im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya
Every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona
Is half a facade and Matthew and Stans just symbolic
Of you not knowin what you had til its gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
Im the hindsight to say I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you dont stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
When its time to walk away Im every guilt trip
The baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
If theres anything you have left to say
Less it makes an impact then dont bother
So fore you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop A wallop 
So one last time Im back
Fore it fades into black and its all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh as we pick up where the last Mathers left off

7443,"Wack Niggaz Pt 2 Lyrics
Yeah
Yolet me let me let me let me tell you why why
This niggawhy we dedicated this song to this kind of nigga
Cuz number one duke is drivin in the motherfuckin projects
With a with a Sebring and with with a rag off
Ynamean Yyou not ballin like that playboy
Straight up then the bitch you got playin shotgun
Like I used to serve that bitch cmon
Really really good I mean and you gotta shirt and tie
You wack ass nigga
Wack niggasI dont even like to be around em
Give em dap or pound em
See em out they houndin dawg
Sayin they got tracks for me to get down on
Sayin they hot when that shit dont even sound warm
Nigga Im nasty my style is sound porn
The graphic exposin wack asses
I emcee as free as Ol Dirty Bastard
You think you Catholic tryin to appeal to the masses
The Cassius Clay of rap today
Rock a beard like Castaway
You couldnt be dope for even half a day
We keep it hot like its after May
Smoke a nigga then I pass to K
The pastor say we goin to mass today
We have to pray these niggas is wack n eh
I have to say since Pac passed away
Most these niggas dont even deserve a track from me
First of all lets get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get yo tall ass out that C Class coupe
Ysee the whiskay had them girls feelin friskay
You was with mey she said Whos the sissay
And even if they did wanna get bizzay
Freaky like Missay and roll the weed up
You would roll three blunts and fuck up three blunts
Motherfucka you would fuck up a free lunch dawg
Just keep it right thurr like Chingay
Yo girl dont like me how long has shee been gay
Spanish girls tell ya No hable ingle
And everbody wanna run to me for they single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Wack nigga Wake up in the morning dawg and you a
Wack nigga Id kill myself if I was that
Wack nigga Everything you wear and rock is just
Wack nigga Even if you flossin rocks you still

Wack nigga You wack nigga 
You know you wack when ya dawgs tell you

Cuz you only got them there to Say Yes like Floetry
The clique that I oversee aint impressed by ya poetry
Youre the place youre supposed to be
You aint aint comin close to me
It aint that you underrated
Its more that youre under dated
And mediocre at best is all the hoes youve ever dated
For all your guest appearances
You couldnt get the clearances
For them its just a check they dont respect you as a lyricist
Look at what ya lyrics is Murder Death Kill
But you never shot nothin never have never will
Better add on to ya skills before you join this round robin
Of super emcees thatll add to ya problems
In the beginnin God created man in his own image
Im bout to tell you how the story gon finish
Kweli handle his business niggas dont forget it
Cause a wiseman can choose to get ignorant with it
Namean you all can get it Im conisdered the nicest
The way I spit it give these niggas all identity crisis
All day talkin that shit like You hold a gat right
The trip you on must be short cause you pack light act right
You got it twisted tellin niggas that you pack heat
You aint gunning now you runnin like an athlete
You ballas need to quit rhymin like Allen Ive
Start speakin Nuwaubian and followin Malachi
Or anything but rhyme you need to sell drugs for real
Instead of on the radio youd be dead or in jail
All these thug niggas wanna rap
And all these rap niggas wanna thug
And all yall fuckin the game up
Its time to change up my lyrics rip ya frame up
Askin if Im nice like fuckin with a chick
Who dont give head thats a nobrainer
Niggas back bangers you dont even know the names of
Imma bout to meet my quota you about to meet ya Saviour
You wack nigga you about to get shot
Fuck with Talib Kweli thats how you get got boy
Not that Im wildin or even promote violence
Its just youre fuckin up my high can a nigga smoke in silence

3515,"If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away if you go away if you go away
But if you stay Ill make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
Well sail the sun well ride on the rain
Well talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go Ill understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away if you go away if you go away
If you go as I know you will you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again if you ever do for what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now as you turn to go Ill be dying slowly till the next hello
If you go away if you go away if you go away
But if you stay Ill make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
Ill sail on your smile Ill ride on your touch
Ill talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go go I wont cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away if you go away if you go away
If you go away as I know you must
Therell be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Id have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away if you go away if you go away
Please dont go away
",I tell you now as you turn to go Ill be dying slowly till the next hello If you go away if you go away if you go away But if you stay Ill make you a night Like no night has been or will be again Ill sail on your smile Ill ride on your touch Ill talk to your eyes that I love so much But if you go go I wont cry Though the good is gone from the word goodbye If you go away if you go away if you go away If you go away as I know you must Therell be nothing left in the world to trust Just an empty room full of empty space Like the empty look I see on your face Id have been the shadow of your shadow If I thought it might have kept me by your side If you go away if you go away if you go away Please dont go away,If you go away on this summer day Then you might as well take the sun away All the birds that flew in the summer sky When our love was new and our hearts were high When the day was young and the night was long And the moon stood still for the night birds song If you go away if you go away if you go away But if you stay Ill make you a day Like no day has been or will be again Well sail the sun well ride on the rain Well talk to the trees and worship the wind Then if you go Ill understand Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand If you go away if you go away if you go away If you go as I know you will you must tell the world to stop turning Till you return again if you ever do for what good is love without loving you Can

Now Rubio was taught to gather everything that could be gotten
In school he learned an awful on how he could become a lawyer or physician
Not because that was his earthly mission but that lifes all about the jackpot
And teachers only in it for the earnins
Now memorize the knowledge only to forget it later now its worthless
But never taught a sense of purpose
Cause happiness is money focused on what you can get instead of service
In graduation he was nervous
He didnt know which way to go which way the wind would take him
Determined not let the pressures of life bend or break him
No more allowance now its him that must bring home the bacon
He stands behind the counter
And hour after hour
He takes commands that he cant stand
Feelin as though no power
Is in his hands to take a man
He wants to stop and leave
But remains realistic he was never taught to dream

Now Ana graduated school with top honors
And to her parents and her family a lot promised
Started to study to become a doctor
When she was young she used to sing and mesmerize the crowd that used to watch her
She thought about recording
But then decided that was far from a sure thing
And with the house to ride the loot and all the money flowing
She feels a void inside does she enjoy the ride
And really wheres she going
And every time she sees a singer on a stage she ponders
The present circumstances is the life that she belongs to
And all the money does is seem to fill the empty void
Its like shes living out a life she really dont belong to
And will she ever know
May talent ever flow
Some people see the life of fear will make them never go
She saw the ledge but couldnt jump off of the top and leap
But remains realistic she was never taught to dream

And were not taught to dream just get the dough
And wonder why the youth result to hustlin
And no one wants to be behind the counter money crunchin
And when you speak your dreams most people quickly change discussions
Cause dreams they come and go
And scientists deliver mail
Poets work customer sales
Authors teach at yale
Forces off and then derailed  
And money rules his soul buried deep in economics
He never smiles but deep inside him is a brilliant comic
Free thinkers caught behind limited logic
Will never look beyond the stars because they cannot see beyond their wallets
Dont keep it safe cause everything else will be too extreme
So on lunch break they drift off in American day dream

",the life that she belongs to And all the money does is seem to fill the empty void Its like shes living out a life she really dont belong to And will she ever know May talent ever flow Some people see the life of fear will make them never go She saw the ledge but couldnt jump off of the top and leap But remains realistic she was never taught to dream This is for the dreamer in you Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do Possibilities you cant out rule Find the treasure that is hidden in you Dream warrior This is for the dreamer in you Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do Possibilities you cant out rule Find the treasure that is hidden in you Dream warrior And were not taught to dream just get the dough And wonder why the youth result to hustlin And no one wants to be behind the counter money crunchin And when you speak your dreams most people quickly change discussions Cause dreams they come and go And scientists deliver mail Poets work customer sales Authors teach at yale Forces off and then derailed And money rules his soul buried deep in economics He never smiles but deep inside him is a brilliant comic Free thinkers caught behind limited logic Will never look beyond the stars because they cannot see beyond their wallets Dont keep it safe cause everything else will be too extreme So on lunch break they drift off in American day dream To the dreamer in you Hey this is dedicated to the dreamer in you Hey this is dedicated to the dreamer in you Hey this is dedicated to the dreamer in you hey This is for the dreamer in you Never ever let em tell you what you can And what you cannot do Possibilities you cant out rule Find the treasure that is hidden in you Dream warrior This is for the dreamer in you Never ever let em tell you what you can And what you cannot do Possibilities you cant out rule Find the treasure that is hidden in you Dream warrior,This is for the dreamer in you Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do Possibilities you cant out rule Find the treasure that is hidden in you Dream warrior Now Rubio was taught to gather everything that could be gotten In school he learned an awful on how he could become a lawyer or physician Not because that was his earthly mission but that lifes all about the jackpot And teachers only in it for the earnins Now memorize the knowledge only to forget it later now its worthless But never taught a sense of purpose Cause happiness is money focused on what you can get instead of service In graduation he was nervous He didnt know which way to go which way the wind would take him Determined not let the pressures of life bend or break him No more allowance now its him that must bring home the bacon He stands behind the counter And hour after hour He takes commands that he cant stand Feelin as though no power Is in his hands to take a man He wants to stop and leave But remains realistic he was never taught to dream This is for the dreamer in you Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do Possibilities you cant out rule Find the treasure that is hidden in you Dream warrior This is for the dreamer in you Never ever let em tell you what you can and what you cannot do Possibilities you cant out rule Find the treasure that is hidden in you Dream warrior Now Ana graduated school with top honors And to her parents and her family a lot promised Started to study to become a doctor When she was young she used to sing and mesmerize the crowd that used to watch her She thought about recording But then decided that was far from a sure thing And with the house to ride the loot and all the money flowing She feels a void inside does she enjoy the ride And really wheres she going And every time she sees a singer on a stage she ponders The present circumstances is

Just let me be great
Let me be great
I feel like mothafuckin Cassius Clay right now
Genius
Dont be good my nigga be great
After that government cheese we eating steak
After the projects now we on estates
Im from the bottom I know you can relate
Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream Hov got a team
My chain already heavy dont let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush confetti on my fur
Turn right in Rutland niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
Im just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1 of a billion more than niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like its an everyday thing clean
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the uhh
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the lowlow
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murdered Malcolm gave Cassius the shakes
Wait tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know Im gon shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy basking on top
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Lets fuck up the world
Fuck up the uhh
Sipping DUSS boy this aint your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac me Im in the Maybach
This aint grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got strip clubs feeling like Oxford I swear
Teacherteacher Im trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught yall they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere you in the HOVs
Jordan 1s and dungarees
And thats just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
til we all check a billion shit its just the way Im feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling we just top what we top
Cause the bars dont struggle when the struggle dont stop
Just fuck up this world

7655,"Hate It or Love It GUnit Remix Lyrics
Yeah lets take em back
Uhhuh
Comin up I was confused my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy aint around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed Id get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs Id get the hat now thatd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggas had stole my bike
Different day same shit aint nothin good in the hood
Id run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I told Dre from the gate Id carry the heat for ya
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya GGGG for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my NWA gold
I had the whole crowd yellin Free Yayo
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And Im raps MVP
Dont make me remind yall what happened in DC
This nigga aint Gotti he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouthtomouth
Hahaha
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
From the beginnin to the end losers lose winners win
This is real we aint got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change its stayin the same
How many of them boys is witcha
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
Im walking with a snub cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club til they coughin on the rug
Aint never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now its an RIP shirt in my coat
Now Im speedin reminiscin
Holdin my weed in never listen
If I see him Imma lift em
And maybe thatll even the score
But if not itll be me on the floor
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
I started out at 15 scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deucedeuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus rockin a leases
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God Im blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest
You know Im still nice with my cook game
Look man its a hood thang thats why Im loved in Brooklyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey Im still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put em in my fofive
And I aint even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who aint seen a royalty check
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And Im gon shine homey until my heart stop
Go head envy me Im raps MVP
And I aint goin nowhere so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top

6829,"Mr Big Lyrics
Now I was broke as a muthafucka my life at the end see
My so called friends they had no ends to lend me
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin me with no grease
I worked so fuckin hard but the money it never increased
I quit my fuckin job I had no job nigga
Put on the mask get the gloc its time to rob nigga
I hit the streets but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous but my fear wouldnt stop my strollin
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets so I knew I had got bucked
Reachin for my tech some niggas kicked me in my chest
My eyes closed shut and I thought I seen death
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
TMoney walked in and he told me what had happened
I knew him from the hood but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag and I knew that he was bale
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech
He offered me a job said hed front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be
Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
Mr Big Mr Big they call him Mr Big
Mr Big Mr Big but not because of my size
I hit the street slanging yayo then I sold up my block
Sellin 8 sellin deals sellin 20 rocks
Sellin dimes sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack
Some nigga tried to jack me but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches life
Standin on the track my mobile rung and it was T
Hello Yo Eight be the fuck aroung 3 Aight
I met him at the park he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians and get my ass in
Hit for 30 birds if I live Id get five
I smoked them damn Columbians and then got what was mine
Over time my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger thats when bitches started jockin me
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5O
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope makin a 100 Gs a week
I gained respect Im the biggest playa of all time
Dont ever fuck with me cause Im 
Mr Big
Repeat chorus
Chillin at the club with TMoney and JB
Lil Adrian and Boo and my nigga MJG
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds
Drinkin on this Yak makin my way to the back
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest
With a long black weave and a tight red dress
I started conversatin but she didnt want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up now somethin in the air stank
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser
Stood by the door when it opened niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun Hey nigga pow pow
Then I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in I was laying on the bed
Walked up out the room did I go to jail
Hell no They cant stop me
Long live Mr Big Ho

And later on you find out shes doin bad
And deep down inside that makes you feel glad
Its effed up and I dont wanna be like that

Yo met a fly girl by the name of Kay
Baby girl was sharper than a razor blade
Pushed up and I made my way hey 
Hit it off great started dating Kay
Yo she didnt really even make me wait
Put me in a lovely kind of sacred state
Thinkin of a wedding and a cake to bake
Suddenly it started goin wrong
She started coming home more late and late
I was chillin at the bar to make a great escape
Seen her posted up with the homie Blake no way
Furious I started goin ape at Kay
Told me that I just had to take the ache
Left me standin ther with my face disgraced
Took a while to get over the case with Kay
But you know a bro gotta move on on
Months later to the date seen Kay
She had gained a massive ton of weight today
She told me what she did was a great mistake
Loneliness depression was the state she at
Told her Everything would be okay just stay
Positive and things would be okay But hey
Funny as I walked awah away from Kay
Inside my head I heard this little song
It went
Knew a golddigger by the name of Pam
Used to tell me that I was her favorite man
Travel with her everywhere LA to France
Europe and Brazil all the way to Japan
I said its nuttin Im a money makin man
Showered her with gear all of her favorite brands
Took her to the club so she could shake her ass
Suddenly it started goin wrong
Scuffled at the job had to take a stance
Fired on the spot tough break my man
Called up with my problems to relate to Pam
All I heard was click and then a tone
She told me I could go ahead and take my damn
Self and go another place somewhere just scram
It took a while to get over the case with Pam
But I gotta keep pursuin money
Months later and my papers stacked
One day just strollin around the way seen Pam
She looked like she was livin in a paper bag
All alone and pregnant all her days went bad
Goin crazy losin mental space real fast
She pulled a stogie out so she could take a drag
Gave her a dollar as I walked away from Pam
Inside my head I heard the little song

Theres colors on the street
Red white and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
Theres a warning sign on the road ahead
Theres a lot of people saying wed be better off dead
Dont feel like Satan but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can
Keep on rockin in the free world

Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Theres an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she put the kid away and shes gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what shes done to it
Theres one more kid thatll never go to school
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool

Got a man of the people says keep hope alive

Murder game I leave no evidence credentials
Go ask my preschool even talk to my old principal
Hed tell you how I used to pack a No 2 pencil
Stabbin students grabbin teachers Catholics preachers
In the school staircase cuttin class passin my reefer
In my own class operation return they tried to say
I was incompetent not able to learn
The tables turned now got my own label I earned
Like that nigga said in Dead Presidents Money to burn
Queensbridge pay homage respect Nas is a vet
Acknowledge the rep polish baguettes
Niggas is this and that Im just the best
Puttin all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings and blood los sangres blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom to help teach in prison
My crew puff lye anyone testin Pun must die
Just give me one try now you know you done fucked up right
Ha you aint got no wins in mi casa

Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
Ill appear in your dreams like Freddy do no kidding you

Who look at life this way thats what the old folks say
But every time Id see them makes me wish I had a gun
If I thought that I was crazy well I guess Id have more fun

Ooh the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh wont let you get away from him

For anybody or anyone
That needed comfort from somebody
Needed comfort from someone
Who cared to be not like you and unlike me
And then the voices went away from me
Somehow you set the wheels in motion now haunts our memories
You were the instrument you were the one
How a body took a body you gave that boy a gun
Took our innocence beyond our stares
Sometimes the only thing we counted on when no one else was there

Dance of the Macabre as witches streak the sky
Decadent worship of black magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devils Dungeon trapped without a plea oh

Locked in a pillory nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life no one hears a sound

Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries

You know when I hold you you wont be alone
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as Im here as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if hes ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And hes older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But its old school its like 03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody elses past

Top down cant be a classic if its no wood
If you dont know what then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mels IceTs and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause its hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And thats a track and if you want a eeeeeeeh 
You have to make it like that

How can I reeltoreel when theres Pro Tool
I cant dig it at all because theres no tube
Fire when you speak but aint no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If its better with time then think in line
That youre going to be your nicest round your midlife crisis
If youre life like Christ live your midlife like its Christlike
Nigga I aint psychic
I know its all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous youre Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school

3931,"The Rangers had a homecoming in Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
Over the Jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance
And disappear down Flamingo Lane
Well the maximum lawman run down Flamingo
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
And the kids round here look just like shadows
Always quiet holding hands
From the churches to the jails
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand down in Jungleland
Well the midnight gangs assembled
And picked a rendezvous for the night
Theyll meet neath that giant Exxon sign
That brings this fair city light
Man theres an opera out on the turnpike
Theres a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops cherry top rips this holy night
The streets alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made they vanished unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
Hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted
Explode into rocknroll bands
That faced off against each other out in the street
Down in Jungleland
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays
Lonelyhearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
Just one look and a whisper and theyre gone
Beneath the city two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender
In a bedroom locked in whispers
Of soft refusal and then surrender
In the tunnels uptown the Rats own dream guns him down
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light
Outside the streets on fire in a real death waltz
Between whats flesh and whats fantasy
And the poets down here
Dont write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of the night they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand
But they wind up wounded not even dead
Tonight in Jungleland

4170,"My mind blows decisions at times indecisive
I think about the paradox that life is
Keep my head to the sky and understand what Christ is
Turn off the news cause every day is a crisis
Lifeless niggas on the couch weeded out
Its certain types of niggas in my life I weeded out
I believe in the route of soul before paper
No gold before labor truth told with no glaziers
Days are getting darker quick
I was told it was written Ima author it
Wanna go the same place that the martyrs went
The black figures on the wall in my apartment
Like LaDainian yall I be charging it
Touching down with the people from my town
Its the Chi that be giving me my ground
Dug in the crates of my soul and I found clarity
Be yourself ah and be so clear come on 
Ayo just be yourself and be so clear 
So just be yourself yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself and be so clear 
Be yourself yeah and be so clear 
Ayo just be yourself and be so clear 
So just be yourself yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself and be so clear 
Toiled in the trenches faced judges on benches
Betrayed by some that I fed not to mention
Standing here now in the best condition
Up outta the dirt so I suggest you listen
See money cant make you or me
Protect my mind with nines cause it shines more than jewelry
Used to do things that werent too productive
Now I breathe life into mics for your comfort
I see past the groupies and golddiggers to fine women
How Im living Doing me and not savagely driven
Taught the game of fortune and fame
So Im not playing no more I hold the torch with flames
Ive lost and gained at the same time
MCs biting and swagger jacking still commit the same crimes
Once you see past the surface
That trash is worthless with me you get a lasting purpose
Be yourself and be so clear come on 
Ayo just be yourself and be so clear 
So just be yourself yall be so clear 
Cmon just be yourself and be so clear 
Just be yourself ah and be so clear

3753,"We need to have a conversation
I made you why would I play you
Trade home base for a California angel
Swing at a fast bitch foul out betray you
When I wont even wanna hit it in a day or two
Straight home Id run well thats debatable
I cant front I hit a slump all players do
But tough times are minor to a major dude
We all lose sometimes I call it paying dues
Now youre searching other clubs for whats available
A year ago my slot was unassailable
My feast is a famine without you to cater to
If these walls could talk what would they say to you
Dont understand what were going though
But its like you dont know me
And I dont know you no more
Not no more
And its like damn how the hell we get here
No idea but were not what we were before
Could it be that I dont love you
And you dont love me no more
That girl dont live here not no more
Yeah yeah yeah that girl no more
The dining room has an empty chair
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair
House full of company but no ones here
Were saying cheers while were holding back tears
To keep up appearances in front of our peers
We play holiday card tricks every year
Black jack poker make the joker disappear
The ace cant breathe when theres tension in the air
Three clubs in one night but nobody cares
Cause its still not a full house without a pair
You tipped your hand but the text wasnt clear
Youre dealing from the bottom queen of hearts play fair
Slip in the door you hold my hopes so
All I hear is love dont live here anymore
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold
Were sitting on a fence so where you wanna go
Youre the architect of your life its your show
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow
Before you burn the house down think take it slow
Even arsonists needs shelter let me know

Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin

Once again its the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Aint it a shame rap is goin crazy 
The lyrical skills are gettin kinda lazy 
The gift theyre shootin couldnt even graze me 
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play G
Now who drops rhymes for the mind only a handful
Only the deaf dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet Im tired of hearin this
Bang bang shoot em up baboo you get buckbucked
If you aint down with whats up
Then you can get with these

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasnt
Nothin lyrical hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters nothin against your
Fake lifestyle but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive cause its inedited you think its better with
Explicit illicit lyrics but like a sedative
The rhymes aint hype so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brothers flows like
So here come the flow the lovable huggable colorful flow
The brother that glows in the dark cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe the highs and lows
Its up and down and out you go
So back up regroup slow down and check the cut
And if you still aint down get up on these

I come in the circumference 360 as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High you know the rhymes most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets I sinks the ships
So one shot aye captain I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin theyre mackin so I pimpslap em
Showin em whos large in charge runnin em up outta dodge

Got a country son got a country chain
Coming down in the car and gripping country grain

Birds high up in the trees
Serenade the flowers with their melodies
Oh see there beyond the hill
The bright colours of the rainbow

Oh dont ever make me cry
Through long lonely nights without love
Be always true to me

3487,"Every night Im lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces
And loud empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Ohohohoh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
You get the best of my love 
Ohohohoh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
You get the best of my love 
Im going back in time
And its a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping
But every morning
I wake up and worry
Whats gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasnt enough
Ohuhoh but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Ohohohoh sweet darling

6061,"Yeah now you see what the Lord doin
Rippin pages out the book I had to make the story fluent
Thanks to Marshall Im sober doin what I enjoy doin
Im puttin Chavis Chandler on had to at least pay it forward to him
Yeah every other day another star is born
And thats to freshen the decayin of the art form
Fuck with my commas shit will be quick
Got whats in my pocket out of the dirt filthy rich
I stuck to my promise to momma stay focused
Double entendre Im tryna vocally smoke you you will be missed
The hocus the pocus magician doing tricks in this miserable business
Who spit loyalty forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom paintin pictures of this
Historical war of attrition whos just the dopest the wokest
Im five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
Cause I didnt want her I needed her though I didnt want her
Im hot as July no lie I wouldnt lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth dont expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now yall scared of them shook niggas
Jamal Crawford couldnt crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets
Uhh Best Rapper Alive broadcasts in five
Four three two one
Im fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society though I am a promise
I am a oneofone like Id say a Isaiah Thomas
You cant fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac Im thinkin of sinkin your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I cant fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
Im private when I fly I ball out like Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers we just out here mobbin like old Italians
Snatching your homies necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries Im toetotoe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this 44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contraesque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose I cant go out like Im Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware pair of Pumas on
Looking like Im aboard a Lear headed to uniform
Im so lyrically rare I spearheaded the unicorn
I was born a bold one sugarcoated
All the way Im livin put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me they say Aint nobody did this nah
And if they dont they shit been off just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I wont break a fool they dont want me to blow
But every single show they hand out like I owe em
Already paid my dues and wordings uh
But if I said it then they still wont know so I wont waste my time on you
And speakin on the level that ya never on the way they hatin so incredible
My writings on the wall to you its so illegible
Im invincible youre sleepin on me Ima stay woke
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

But all this cash it just complicates things
And all this money that we into
It will drive you crazy but it only makes me go harder

Sometimes you gonna think that its too much on ya
But think what Id be doing if this wasnt going on
So I just keep pushing when Im being pulled in every direction
Now Im popping so the they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to the riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord if you hear me I dont need not a new friend near me
Cause I dont want none of that fake love
Cause how Im looking at it all of that be made up
I remember when I wasnt this big
And now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but Im strong
I did all this on my own
Aint got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall
Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still aint forget the times when I didnt have none
Back against the wall feeling like I had to grab some
Thats when I took time and I figured it out
Id rather deal with the stressing more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadnt seen
Talking bout no money no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldnt stand me
Now we talking bout VMAs and a Grammy
But in due time turn nothing into something
So now I need money put it all in my discussions
I remember when I wasnt this big
And now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but Im strong
I did all this on my own
Aint got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall
And if you wasnt here when I was down
Then you wont be here when Im up
Now the same one you looked over
Be the same one that blew up
Aint it funny how this life thing works
When you think its finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I cant even keep a dry eye
But my how time flies by when you on top of the world sky high
I remember when I wasnt this big
And now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
Oh now everybody wanna love me
Try to knock me down but Im strong
I did all this on my own
Aint got no time for no new friends
So for now just leave me alone

I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway
I dont need yall anyway I dont need yall anyway

6403,"You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving
On your loving
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
Thats all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman aint scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
Shes sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honeycoated complexion using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl shes from around the way
I need an around the way girl Around the way girl 
Thats the one for me Shes the only one for me 
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving
Silky milky her smile is like sunshine
Thats why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didnt tell you then another brother would
Youre sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon silk or maybe even denim
It really doesnt matter as long as youre in em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty youre ready for loving
Youre real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay On your loving 
Come around my way
I need an around the way girl Around the way girl 
Thats the one for me Shes the only one for me to the bridge 
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With your New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here you say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way youre like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you so youre crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your bikin shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share

Now little Lisas only nine years old
Shes tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why shes all alone and they never met her family
Mommas always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobodyll listen
Mommas on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her mommas knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma dont believe her
Lisas stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says shes bout to run away and never come back Like this

Little Nicole is only ten years old
Shes steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why shes not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions shes makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside cryin on the out
Its only one girl really knows what shes about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that theyll always be tight til the end
Until one day lil Stacy gets shot
A driveby bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicoles stuck up in a world on her own

Emotions run deep as she thinks shes in love
So theres no protection hes usin no glove
Never thinkin bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrows satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he aint ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion

And when were on the mic were in charge
Its like that yall that yall like that yall that yall 
Like thatathathat alike that yall that yall 
Cool chief rocker I dont drink vodka
But keep a microphone inside my locker
Go to school everyday on the side makin pay
Cause Im rockin on the mic until the break of day
And now the things I do make me a star
And you could be too if you know who you are
Just put your mind to it youll go real far
Like a pedal to the metal when youre drivin a car
Liggyliggyliggylisten to the things that I say
Because its not routine its the way I play
Just come out my mouth all time of the day
And then I must have time to give it away
Hey they used to call me Easy D
Cause I rapped on the mic so easily
But now they call me DMC
Hes the Emcee of the party
The Ds for doin it all of the time
The Ms for the rhymes that are all mine
The Cs for cool cool as can be
And why you wear those glasses So I can see
Huhhuh

Rhymes that you never even heard before
Now if you say you heard my rhymes were gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the superdef rhymes last night
Microphone master super rhyme maker
I get def as the others get faker
Its me DMC in the place to be
And I still got the same old harmony
Im the devastatin miccontroller
The word wizard and the chief rock roller
Bad bboy made for the bgirls
Rock ruler rhymes as the turntable twirls
Supreme being who was born to talk
And over sucker MCs all day I walk
A few years ago my name was Joe
And then I went to a party cold stole the show
Stole it as sure as birds have wings
Now theyre callin me DJ Running Things
Got Kurtis Blow down with the two
And my man Larry Lah makes beats for you
Keepin up the funky beat is the Hollis Crew
So Dee take the mic cause you know Im through
In case you wonder what all this means
Were funky fresh from Hollis Queens
Run and Kurt both down with me
And thats the way its meant to be
Im the microphone master DMC

But still Im facetoface
With the one person I cant replace
One person I cant just tell Im doin fine
What up Ma
Been a while
Lot of catchin up to do
Know you got a ear full
Im listenin
Momma said she loves me said she cares
Said if I need her shell always be there
But even her sayin that struck me as weird
Why did she feel those words I needed to hear
Said she understands me that was rare
Cause no one understands me not even my peers
And these just thoughts I never bother to share
So as I write my eyes start to tear
I aint tell her Im tired but still troopin
Alone but I find myself regroupin
Aint say my brain now feel like a prison
Figured Id shut the fuck up and listen
She continued that was honorable
She said I get more and more irresponsible
For normal folks she said thats a challenge
Luckily I mask mine behind talent
She said You are no longer yourself
I dont know what to expect of you
Said Im puttin up with things I normally wouldnt
She dont know why its acceptable
She said People livin in your house
Dont pay shit not respectable
I told her theyre folk I think highly of
She said Well they must think less of you
Must feel entitled all you doing
I said Ill fix it she said No you wont
Then I got defensive but still replied
I told her I need them she said No you dont
Then she said Whens the last time you spoke to your father
I said hes selfcentered why bother
Cause he only really call about his needs
And I aint got enough time to deal with his greed
Cause my days are darker
Cut from a long shank but the blade is sharper
Im makin my notsovague departure
Tell pop Im his son not his Spades partner
Last time that we spoke
He wanted to use the crib throw a party here
Which wasnt partly fair
My home need to feel like home even if I throw a party here
Then he catch an attitude
And I catch one right back at you
We adore each other but ignore each other
Think this is how the fuck I wanna act with you
Things just aint the same
But he sure will call about a Yankee game
Like Call CC and get back to me
Whats ill is he say it so casually
I love him so much he can have all the perks
Hurts so much I take all the Percs
Hurts so much but fuck it it works
Hurts so much that I cant sleep
Mom say I need to sleep more
Then again she aint on this stress level
So many people rely on me
Im tryin to get us all to the next level
Wait told her I took baby girl to the doctor
It was only for a checkup though
And she gave me the face like Now would be time
If theres anything I feel I need to let her know
But thats just Mom again just bein a mom again
Looked down at the tat on my arm again
God please give me the strength keep calm again
She asked me if Kaylin was pregnant
I looked at her like she was crazy
Cause thats my baby whats wrong with a baby
She said Nothin at all when youre not datin a baby
Beautiful girl I like everything about her thus far
I just dont wanna see you fall
Just a tad bit young so she got some growin up to do
And I replied Dont we all
Momma said Why cant you ever be alone
I said What do you mean
Went to correct her she did it herself
She said At least thats how it seems
Pop aint called hes still mad
Still pissed hes still angry
Im still goin no plan of slowin
No way Ill ever let his immaturity taint me
Momma said that Tahiry called
That aint shock me they speak a lot
Shes helpful and knowin my ex

5587,"Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick mad chicks be on a brother tip
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car
All the hoes gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets thats what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich then them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
Cause if you broke youll get a whack slut
If you got dough you get a hoe with a fat butt
With fresh gear long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone shes gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losin all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and outta luck
Then she takes off and breaks off your hoes gone
So long dear Im outta here a good relationships been torn
Cause when you on top everythings okay
But when you broke you gets no play
If you dont got endz you wont be gettin no skinz
And if you dont got money you wont scoop a honey
If you dont got cash you wont be gettin no ass
And if youre not clockin loot you wont be knockin no boots
Girls in the 90s aint nothin but crooks
Its all about whats in your pockets not how you look
Thats why you cant talk to just any whore
Leavin brothers for the next man cause he got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always askin for a dollar
And if you pushin a fresh Benz theyll be your best friends
Yeah As long as you collect ends
You think shes all yours
But as soon as your dough go your hoe go now you solo
But when you was makin papes sellin jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hoes
And you was takin em to the movies every weekend
Now that youre dead broke the girls stopped speakin
Cause nowadays girls want you to trick
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big
Cause when you on top everythings okay
But when you broke you gets no play
I tell it how it is cause Im a bold figure
And I hate a moneyhungry girl AKA gold digger
It aint even funny
Some girls dont even know me askin me can they get some money
Im lookin nothin like your poppa
I wouldnt give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why Im so fly
A girl asked me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz Imma break it down like this
Its like that yall and thats a fact yall
I hit hoes from the back and dont give a jack yall
Its Big L yall Im livin swell yall
I do my thing thats why my name ring bells yall
If you dont got endz girls be frontin
If you dont got endz they aint givin up nothin
If you dont got endz all the girls ignore you
If you dont got endz they act like they never saw you
If you dont got endz if you dont got endz if you dont got endz

Ayo Dre whats goin on man Whats goin on
Ay what chall gonna do for this last record
Nah tell me what chaall gonna do
Okay you want me to do the intro Aight
Parental discretion is advised for the moment
While Im gettin candid now understand it
Aint too typical in any way
Though the pro on the mic is the DOtotheC this is an intro
I know The DOC makes you wanna take a Valium
So buy a bucket cause upcomin is my album
And for the record meanin my record check it
Listen to the single and youll be like Yo I gotta get it
But in the meantime listen to the rhyme
Of the Dr Dre played with NWA
Yellas on the drum roll rockin the beat
Ayo Dre Where you gonna take this shit man
Ayo lets take it to the street WORD UP 
Let em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckas to stop guessin
Cause I dont give a fuck about radio play
Observe the English I display
Lyrics for the adults children have been barred
And scarred from listenin to somethin so muthafuckin hard
Dope Pumpin thats so my shit will never falter
Yo its Dre so fuck the Mind of Minolta
Psycho like no other muthafucka
So step to me wrong GO for what you NO
But be warned never will I leave like a regular
Cause Im a little better than the regular competitor
I use to see em on stage
Earnin money like a thief but without a gauge
Until I got full of clockin the lame gettin pull
They said you wasnt gon get paid Nah thats bullshit
They like it stylistic and I enchant the crowd like Im a mystic
CCCC CCCcameras are flashin when Im in action
A photo or fresh with the flair for fashion
Pure simplicity see its elementary
You hear one of the hardest muthafuckaz this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise and they guys
Parental discretion is advised
Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat cause I worn this cause its like enormous
Some shit I dont take it not even in a toilet
And shit from a suckas put in a pot and Ill boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe the muthafuckaz will learn
Im not a sub cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince cause Im a principal
Im engineerin the shit that youre hearin
Cause when it comes to power Im powersteerin
Silly you say I say youre silly when you say it
Rushin to the eject to put my shit in and play it
Its like Apollo but Im not an amateur
And Im not givin a fuck while Im damagin ya
Its for the record so Rens lyrics is gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved Id win it
Possession is mine and Im the holder
Cause a nigga like Ren dont give a fuck cause Im older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it Parental discretion is advised
I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
Cause if you fail to see read it in Braille itll still be funky
So whats next is the flex of a genius
My rapidstuttersteppin if you seen this
Dope you hope that I dont really mean this
But if Play made a greater hightop fade
Its not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guessed it was a test of a different style
Its just another muthafucka on the pile
Drivin your ass with the flow of the tongue
You hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung to your attention
By the hardest muthafuckin artist that is known for lynchin
Any sucka in a minute stagger em all
When I start flowin like Niagara Falls
Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when Im mad and then my tail rattle
I get low on the flow so let your kids know
When I bust parental discretion is a must
Little did they know that I would be arrivin
And its surprisin rockin it from where I been
But its the E here to take no mistakes will be made
In the trade where funky ass records are bein played
Fuck the regular Yo as I get better the
Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
So I get em hot thinkin theyre gonna get it
As they sit rubbin their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny but
Theres no service of beef without money
So slip the Cnote and you can choke
On a wingdingdingaling down your throat
Foreplay to me aint shit
When you spread em Im ready then you can get the dick
Of the Ez if you can deal with the size
But if you cant parental discretions advised
Shut the fuck up

8032,"Raw Extended Alternate Version LyricsOne two doin a few for you
Intro I start to go my rhymesll flow so
Get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you are loungin around its time to get up
Pardon my expression but Imma tear shit up
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
I do declare Gettin busy is where its at
But with what youre sayin you wouldnt get a point for that
Cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat
You say youre rockin How many shows you get
All your vocals go local on the MIC
Mines go a great distance like ATT
Im not new to this Im true to this nothin you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So yo go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse
Get you a nurse too late get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct I get respect
Im out to collect cash money but thats another subject
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin
To sound like me so soon Ill have to open
A school of emceein for those who wanna be in
My field and court but then again on second thought
To have MCs comin out soundin so similar
Its quite confusin for you to remember the
Originator and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator but Im much greater
Im A number one second to none
A sufficient title for me would be champion
Of any event in which I present
Fresh lyrics you hear it and mark them excellent
Very exquisite and explicit
Extraordinaire so what is it
Nothin but the finest your supreme Highness
Out to diminish delete and minus
All rappers thats inferior playin my area
Rhymes I recite will make them deteriorate away
And just get this straight
To compete I will defeat and totally humiliate
All imitation with the combination
Of rhymes more deadlier than Freddy or Jason
Ill be on ya like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know youd step the hell off
On a peaceful eve give me space to breathe
The way I be rockin you wouldnt believe
Im athletic energetic my rhymes are poetic
And while others are pathetic my style is copacetic
Innovator dominator rhyme creator
My rhymes are food for your party now allow me to cater
Cause Im the rappers idol and my title is so vital
MCs tryna take it Results are homicidal
All MCs try to handle me are led to misfortune and calamity
So to whom it may concern please try and learn
That in a battle with the Kane you just get burned
Cause Im a slayer rhymesayer thats out to kill
Progress manifest drop science and build
And any rapper tryna stop me from comin through
Like Chaka Khan I Feel For You
Destruction and corruption is what will occur
Much damage bein done as I injure
And when I get through rockin the mic like this
Youll have to thank the God Almighty if you still exist
Like that yall its like that yall
And when my Ballys run down I get taps yall
So Kool G Rap my mellow my man
Get on the mic with the gangsta plan
This little note is like a formula the antidote
For copycatters I quote they wanna deepthroat
Lyrics that I wrote placed upon a beat so neat
Orchestras and bands cant compete or compare
Or even come near to this here
This is a mere affair you just stare and cheer
Crystal clear to your ear perhaps some rappers are up there
To me theyre just Hollywood Squares
Music I create rotates on a plate
And I know some people hate me because Im great
Got a lot of females cause my records make sales
While the others on the shelf is goin slower than snails
And this shows the pros are so composed
Also enemies and foes to G Rap theyre only zeros
Not heroes theyre fractions minus the action of satisfaction
Also the brain of the main attraction
Im not mixed with any studio tricks
No special effects like you see in the flicks
Im dramatic so there you have it Im fantastic
Competitors are plastic stretch em like elastic
Then grab the microphone
And create a relaxin tone like a saxophone
If you dont like it then use the exit to hell with it
Im Kool G Rap and I made it I did it
Mission completed suckers are defeated
I sweated and bleeded but yet I succeeded
So please be aware that this is a war
If the shoe fits wear it cause thats what its made for
My metaphors are excellent yours are poor
My literature will score more for sure
The creature feature searcher preacher teacher
Torture rupture capture rapture reach ya
Musical master rhyme reacts as a
Brain that has the knowledge of NASA
Youre just a KitKat small as a TicTac
But Im a Big Mac cause Im G Rap
Well equipped with a hiphop lip
My memory bank is like a microchip
My bassll give a shake of an earthquake
Itll make you sucker MC wanna jump in the lake
Cause Im murder homicide comma
Crush kill destroy with excitement and drama
Speaker sound seeker you become weaker
My art is a smoker your material is mediocre
The rap Olympia devastate the area
Im gettin brainier lyrical mania
Power source energy enforced
Your headboards will need Red Cross
So come one or two step through a few
Doubles and couples and Ill cripple all triples huh
You cant handle it
None or any one or many some or plenty
Cause Im not a stranger just the rhyme arranger
Highly explosive keep out danger
Packin Gs while you try to be me
But for these MCs I call em the wannabe Gs
What I write is in the smokin section
Heres an injection of rap perfection
So what the heck You select my dialect
Next mans cassette yo reject and eject
Cause I could use a technique modern or antique
Beats never repeat show you that I can speak
Totally properly but rappers wanna copy me
This takes strategy just like Monopoly
Figure it out
Kool G Rap is about makin armies and crews look like Girl Scouts
Cause when I start rappin I keep the people clappin
Suckers that be yappin dont think that this can happen
",if you still exist Like that yall its like that yall And when my Ballys run down I get taps yall So Kool G Rap my mellow my man Get on the mic with the gangsta plan This little note is like a

What goes around comes around
Goes around 
Doing justice to poetry
This is a flurry a fist of fury
A rhyme so fast that it has to blurry
Your vision dont wink blink or stop to think
Or you might miss the next rhyme
Ink flows from the brain to the pen
And comes alive when the thought transcends
From the pen to the paper and paper to tape and
A tape to the wax and back to the tape
Another hit which you cant get with
A brainiacll react but a nitwit
Cant relate he cant hold the weight
The rhymes too deep and he sleeps awake
The comatose need a double dose
Cause Kool Moe Dee dont rhyme like most
Simplified rhymes or out of the norm
But I simplify if Im to perform
Records for the poprock playlists
The pop jocks dont play this
In an intent to hold rap back
They stop the hard hard and play the wack wack 
They play the weak cause the weak wont speak
But that just makes a fan go seek
A station that they know will bust this

Poetic phonetic genetic frenetic
You connect it
Those who chose to oppose are foes
And usually cant grow afros
As the rhyme flows the spirit grows
But only those with a pure soul knows
The relevance of the beat of the drum
And where its coming from
For those of you who just dont listen
Heres the second boat youre missin
Just like Noah had you swimming
Raps a warning of an ending
Of an era a reign of terror
Over like a nova never ever
Try to amplify the lie
The truth wont die and thats why I
A versatile child of the Nile
Speak with a ghetto style and meanwhile
The reason I relate to the youth
Is pure souls can feel the truth
The poisoned souls have tried to stop it
But just stop it cause hiphop is
From our roots and you cant touch this
This is our ancestors poetic justice

6741,"The world fears a person with a dream
Because to have a dream gives you the ambition to wanna fulfill wanna that dream
And if you live your life fulling that dream youre gonna glow man Because theres a magnificence and a moment that comes with fulfilling you dream that you cant achieve being a part of someone elses
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love God I need you right now
You got famous fell off came back up damn thats insane
The same as you must be to be in this game
In this game you suffer hit strangers
Like Usain you bolt towards your dream
But haters speak disdain
Know my name and your name
But one things for sure man
Success is a sickness and there aint no cure man
Cure all is work hard and dont take no tours off
And even on off days you cant act like youre off
The payoff is tenfold in dollars and euros
Pitfalls of vanity pride and your ego
Just let go and live up to your full potential
What they say is hearsay its inconsequential
But naysayers say no but they are so simple
That they judge appearance and cant touch the mental
They are sheep they follow shepherds and man
Im Malcolm Im Martin I follow my plan
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love God I need you right now
Do it for family but they dont believe
That dreams that you have can even be achieved
Get ready young sailor heres rough on these seas
Cant let no doubt or selfpity drown me
Its design when you sign and the vultures appear
And if you should succeed then its worse by the year
But the worse curse is failure it kills by the day
Watch your dreams and ambitions as they fade away
See my curse is Ill verse in these verses I verse
Will still be overlooked like a body in hearse
But this Lazarus rap and this is my rebirth
This is no pen no paper just my dream on verse
The boot lady told me she dreamed I was cursed
Told her if you cant tell I returned to Earth
Returned to the dirt returned to the essence
Cause no weapon formed that gives me a succession
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love God I need you right now
I hope youve learned about the business of chasing your dreams out there
I hope youre chasing your dreams till youre exhausted till your feet hurt till your bones ache and till you get it youre hoping that you wont let it go
I want this to be more than good music to you I hope its inspiration for you
Chad Butler told me a few years back fight for your dream Michael like a drowning man fightin for air
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate

I viewed a mighty light approaching in a zoom
Need was there to tell someone of my discovery
Fifteen seconds later a light appeared in front of me
To my surprise there stood a man with age and mystery
His name was Jupiter and came to visit me
The name is Jupiter from the galaxy
I came to meet you to make you free
Deliver to you a flower from
A distant planet from where I come
Keep your eye on Jupiter such beauty in the sky
We will wait for your return in the by by
Keep your eye on Jupiter memories we shall fulfill
Just to view a brighter day and do a righteous will
Watching and considering my visual state of mind
The flower fragrance help reveal to me the sign
The sign of love I had confessed to live and really know
The sign of love which I had failed my fellowman to show
The name is Jupiter from the galaxy
I came to meet you to make you free

Uhh
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Talk to em talk to em 
I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me
Im holding onto my last bit of decency
I need a vacay a change of scenery
But mama said wherever Ima go Im taking me with me
I told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me
She got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me
Its not the drugs that got me out of my zone
Going days without eating in a crowd I feel alone mama
Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night
I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
I speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me
She told me theres a higher power and a lower power
And that Ill die if I dont find the strength to overpower
Then I replied well arent we all
She said yeah but that should be on Gods terms not yours
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
Tryin to weather the storm
I thought that black cloud was gone
Its been beside me all along not the song
I wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute
Tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute
Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs worse
Cant be depression couldnt have it this long
So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron my nigga
Speaking of secrets thats when I got the Kaylin text
Read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next
She said youre going through a lot
Im hoping you aint in the grave and dead
Cause not too many people know your brains a mess
Who knew that she was keeping track of it all
I wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all
I aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap
Pen and pad in my hand and I was writing a note
Didnt get far as soon as I wrote down mom I just stopped
Couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her
Couldnt explain the why to her
Couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her
And shortly after that my pastor called
Which at first I kinda thought it was weird
But that convo preserved me bout Gods grace and mercy
He aint even say goodbye he said let us pray
And then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes
Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear
Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured
Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour
All my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack
If everybody calls you a duck will you just quack
Guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back
Cause when I had that burner ready to bust I didnt clap
Joe
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
Guess Im insanitys definition
Trying to step over in sanitys repetition
But I cant it got me tripping
Whatever love we had was dead that night
Looking back we both needed cooler heads that night
Was going off no sleep eyes red that night
While you was drunk texting me I hope I read that right
You was beefing bout Giselle beefing bout Alexa
Suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that I had sexed her
I was laughing thought it was funny
Giselles the homie Alexas twenty
With hip withdrawals
Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
I wouldnt dick her at all
Im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me
Was there for four months yet you said this was a new me
In your head guess the answer to this jealousy
Was to turn around and try to make me jealous B
But the part that you neglect
Was never mind jealousy this was bout respect
Yall Instagramming pictures trying to get me upset
You turned that into a night we both would never forget
We both said some things we both probably regret
You was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool
Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
Now Im fucking homeboy up just off the principle
I guess he caught him self antagonizing me
But hes a young nigga thats no surprising me
Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes
I left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho
I guess the part where I lose
Is now they got my face plastered all over the news Im being falsely accused
And I dont understand was this all part of a plan
I guess Ill tell the whole truth when on the stand
How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house
Now they got a search warrant just to come to my house
Question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid
And you know Jersey gun laws Im talking hollow tips
So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know whats going on
Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
Your face is fine this is a big waste of time
Lets get back to that jealousy
Now you got a nigga facing three felonies
All for what cause we were no longer dealing
You attack me but Im the villain over a fucking iPhone and feelings
Check you never see me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait
So now the whole world is watching me get burned here
Which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here
Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
Anytime theres a pole in the bar centered
So even though its from afar now
I still wish you the best I know your hearts tender
Im sorry all I just got my own scars to tend to
Signing off truly yours with love Gods sinner
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But he tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But he tells me Im only human

But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
",them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human Guess Im insanitys definition Trying to step over in sanitys repetition But I cant it got me tripping Whatever love we had was dead that night Looking back we both needed cooler heads that night Was going off no sleep eyes red that night While you was drunk texting me I hope I read that right You was beefing bout Giselle beefing bout Alexa Suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that I had sexed her I was laughing thought it was funny Giselles the homie Alexas twenty With hip withdrawals Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all I wouldnt dick her at all Im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me Was there for four months yet you said this was a new me In your head guess the answer to this jealousy Was to turn around and try to make me jealous B But the part that you neglect Was never mind jealousy this was bout respect Yall Instagramming pictures trying to get me upset You turned that into a night we both would never forget We both said some things we both probably regret You was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you Now Im fucking homeboy up just off the principle I guess he caught him self antagonizing me But hes a young nigga thats no surprising me Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes I left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho I guess the part where I lose Is now they got my face plastered all over the news Im being falsely accused And I dont understand was this all part of a plan I guess Ill tell the whole truth when on the stand How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house Now they got a search warrant just to come to my house Question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid And you know Jersey gun laws Im talking hollow tips So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want But you and I know whats going on Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind Your face is fine this is a big waste of time Lets get back to that jealousy Now you got a nigga facing three felonies All for what cause we were no longer dealing You attack me but Im the villain over a fucking iPhone and feelings Check you never see me act like a jerk I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait So now the whole world is watching me get burned here Which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders Anytime theres a pole in the bar centered So even though its from afar now I still wish you the best I know your hearts tender Im sorry all I just got my own scars to tend to Signing off truly yours with love Gods sinner My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But he tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But he tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human,Mic check mic check One two one two New Joe Budden Uhh Please somebody help my soul Please somebody help my soul Please somebody help my soul Please somebody help my soul Talk to em talk to em I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me Im holding onto my last bit of decency I need a vacay a change of scenery But mama said wherever Ima go Im taking me with me I told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me She got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me Its not the drugs that got me out of my zone Going days without eating in a crowd I feel alone mama Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me I speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me She told me theres a higher power and a lower power And that Ill die if I dont find the strength to overpower Then I replied well arent we all She said yeah but that should be on Gods terms not yours My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But He tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human Tryin to weather the storm I thought that black cloud was gone Its been beside me all along not the song I wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute Tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs worse Cant be depression couldnt have it this long So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron my nigga Speaking of secrets thats when I got the Kaylin text Read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next She said youre going through a lot Im hoping you aint in the grave and dead Cause not too many people know your brains a mess Who knew that she was keeping track of it all I wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all I aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap Pen and pad in my hand and I was writing a note Didnt get far as soon as I wrote down mom I just stopped Couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her Couldnt explain the why to her Couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her And shortly after that my pastor called Which at first I kinda thought it was weird But that convo preserved me bout Gods grace and mercy He aint even say goodbye he said let us pray And then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour All my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack If everybody calls you a duck will you just quack Guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back Cause when I had that burner ready to bust I didnt clap Joe My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But He tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove
5138,"Nobody ever said life was gon be easy
But damn
Just a kid moms died when I was seven
Pops died eleven whats up with heaven
Its hell when youre an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eelskin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all night long
I was like Put me on
But they said Little fellow run and go play
Take your butt to school or else youll have to be like us one day
I didnt understand but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls cause theyd hustle and rob
I was like makin bout 150 a week
And after taxes you know what that is lunch meat
And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car man
I gotta get a girl
I know I can do it out there man
Im gonna go for it man
I gotta get some money
Word
Streets of anger trouble and crime
I had it hard had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up my gear clean
Even when checkin minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels quick to flex with tools
Pimpin hoes on the block
Checkin cash nonstop
Crack spots armor with interior bars
No lie I used to own bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget Cesars Palace holidays
It was on crazy out of control
We made up the word ballin that was how we rolled
But the FBI had awholenother idea
Its called multiple indictments for hundreds of years
What
Daff is dead
Carter got 25 years
Nah
Spike 35 to life
Nah dont tell me BOs dead man
I dont wanna hear that man
I was just with him
The game is vicious no retirement you die young
Listen to a fake he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with brothers I really know
They tell me Ice you got much love in the pen
Youre the one that got away dont wanna see you in
They tell me Tell the little homies the deal
Dont let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel
I marched two million strong in DC
Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me I got a baby son to raise
And bein black aint easy prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together unseparated
Check yourself like I did blackman because were all related

Ask a nigga in my hood he gon say that Im stamped
And when them situations came I came out like a champ
When it was pourin down rain and I came out of it damp
But now its champagne showers when we poppin the champ ugh
We dodged all the Feds and they traps
Niggas cant be us cause they rats
Stand tall point a finger never that
I knew a nigga had it all went to the bing aint get it back
Thats why Im humble as ever and I rumble whatever
Dont chase hoes cause they come with this cheddar
I seen my man girl start actin bougie when he fuck up his cheddar
Before you knew it niggas was fuckin her better
I knew about it and I
Wanted to tell him I felt funny as ever
But when I told him he went runnin to tell her damn
Remember I was down bad Im talkin under the cellar
Now the Rolls Royces come with umbrellas
For the rain and all the pain that we been through

At the end of it all its you

Looking from how I see it
When I finally realized couldnt believe it
I couldnt even swallow
Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so why be pissy
But when you wasnt seeing me nights you get it in
Thats when the snooping and shit it would begin
Where you at Where you going
Thats what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a Hello or I miss you
Or The Renaissance how does it do
Suspicious ones though few
Can stress out your brain it weighs on you man
And helps your peep game I thought it was me
But then I could see
It was you its you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end it was you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end its you
Its you at the end of it all
Its you its you its you

But the spell of love I couldnt shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else who was your lover
You gave me up and managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turned to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doing love
Get it These things you projected
And I dont want to be affected
But when you get in love its never easy love
To make decisions of youve defected
You were doing so much to try to pin me
Going through all my stuff but it was empty
Answers that Im seeking
Well it seems Im getting close that Im reaching
And I was thinking I had no reason
Calling you a culprit it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was cunning not for loving tell me why
Well make amends if you admit it
We can ascend if youre committed
Your heart is it in it
If it goes too many days sweet love can decay from you
Its you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end it was you
At the end of it all it was you
And the end its you its you
At the end of it all its you

4506,"Theres big pieces of a life she cant remember
Her mind shuts down its trying to protect her
Might be for the best to forget but it seems like
They always reappear when she least expects
Late nights we lay awake drowning in the lake that pours out of her face
Years late but shes still not safe
Memories leap out ant time any place
The way he smelledthe way he smiled
The evil she even recognized as a child
Hand on her throat sting of a fist
Instead of her first kiss she got this
Shameful feeling painful secret
Lonely knowin that nobody would believe it
Every wound that escapes her time capsule
Hurts like the day it was born and its brand new
I wasnt there babygirl but Im here
I dont know what to say I just hear
If theres one wish I could make true
I would shoulder that pain and take it off you
Dont run babygirl dont run
You gotta face what you fighting head on
Only one thing I could say in truth
You gotta deal with the demons before they deal with you
How can she find peace in her mind when
Love means returning to the scene of a crime
I can feel it inside weve reopened wounds every time we intertwine
Such an evil design when you cant even enjoy the sweetness you find
Trying to see through the tears in your eyes and rebuild your shrine one piece at a time
E K made it all fade away
Colors dont burn no more its all gray
Cant find heaven from within that shell but its enough of a blessing if just not seen hell
Constant inner dialog says just end this roller coaster ride youre on
Only one solution seems final slide into a hole where your pain cant find you
She said if I was meant to die he wouldve killed me
There must be a reason that I still breathe
I dont have the tools to rebuild me
But I still believe that one day I could feel free
And my body can be mine again
My eyes can learn how to shine again
My inner child wont have to hide and then
When Im strong then love could be invited in
Sweet God thats all I ask of thee
Im willing to give what you demand of me
Im learning to embrace the reality
That life doesnt always turn out how its planned to be
I didnt deserve what was handed me
Only one who can grant happiness is me
What it takes for her to face the day
I can only hope to be half that brave

5976,"voice being scratched 
In a time when were spending billions of dollars
In a war to control oil in Iraq
Threethousand soldiers have come home in coffins
Hundreds of thousands of Iraq civilians have lost their lives
Our brothers and sisters in New Orleans
Are left homeless and hungry
They murdered Sean Bell
They murdered Amadou Diallo
They murdered Timothy Stansbury
And its time to say no more
No more No more No more No more
I got so much trouble on my mind refuse to lose
Heres your ticket uh
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to black attack
So I sat and japped then slapped the Mac
Now Im ready to mic it huh
Hear my favoritism roll oh
Never be a brother like me go solo
Lazer Anastasia maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way Im livin forgiven what Im givin up
X on the flex Hear me now 
I dont know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man Ive had it up to here
Gear I wear got em goin in fear
Rhetoric said it read just a bit ago
Not quittin it signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin jerked
Changin some ways to way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold never follow the code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause its comin from the heart
What I got better get some Mmhmm 
Hustler of culture
Snake bitten been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin
Respects been givin hows ya livin
Now I cant protect a pad off the defect
Check the record of reckon
An international wreck played off as some intellect
Made the call took the fall broke the laws
Not my fault that theyre fallin off
Known as fair square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the terrordome
Come on down Get down 
You can get it get it get it get it
Come on down
You can get it get it get it get it
Get down
You can get it get it get it get it
Theres a hole in an apple an apple has been rotten
Scheme like the Klan I plan like Bin Laden
Supreme screen writer slick street editor
Drop the LP and he hit like Hezbollah
Seven years later its the year of the Gods
United States government is just a facade
The Catholic Church got ties with the mob
I see it all like The Wizard of Oz
Now theres a yellow brick road the fame riches and cars
If you only had a brain you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation cut your education
Secret information world domination
Take over reservations trigger the energies
In the oceans for tsunamis to control the population
Eyes in the sky hidden observation
If youre over sixtyfive theyll take away your medication
Like Give me that Give me that Fall in line Fall in line 
Go to war Go to war press rewind
Cause when I get mad I put it down on the pad
Give you somethin that you never had
Controllin fear of high rollin
God bless your soul and keep livin
Black to the bone my home is your home
Well welcome to the terrordome

Live for you fresh
For all you sucker MCs perpetratin a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
Youre the kind of guy that girl ignored
Im drivin a Caddy you fixin a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle names Ward
And when Im rockin on the mic you should all applaud
Because were wheelin dealin we got a funny feelin
We rock from the floor up to the ceilin
We groove it you move it it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin
We create it relate it and often demonstrate it
Well diss a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it
Were risin suprisin and often hypnotizin
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls no braids peasyhead and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and crossfades
Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didnt fail
I couldnt wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
Im a wizard of a word thats what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
Im the master of a mic thats what I say
And if I didnt say that youd say it any way
Bust into the party come in the place
See the first things come the music in your face
Girls on the walls some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it cant be missed
And you cant leave til youre dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you cant leave until were through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade thats not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok youre not in a rut
Each and everybody out there we got the notion
We want to see yall all in motion
Just shake wiggle jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side back and forth
Were the two MCs and were gonna go off
Stand in place walk or run
Tap your feet youll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJs better than all these bands
Huh
We got all the lines and all the rhymes
We dont drop dimes and we dont do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear the pants they call the Calvin Kleins
Cause Calvin Kleins no friend of mine
Dont want nobodys name on my behind
Lee on my legs sneakers on my feet

2488,"Born in the USA Lyrics
Born down in a dead mans town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog thats been beat too much
Til you spend half your life just coverin up
Born in the USAÂ 
I was born in the USAÂ 
I was born in the USAÂ 
Born in the USAÂ 
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the USAÂ 
I was born in the USAÂ 
I was born in the USAÂ 
I was born in the USAÂ 
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says Son if it was up to me
Went down to see my VA man
He said Son dont you understand
I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off the Viet Cong
Theyre still there hes all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
Im ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run aint got nowhere to go
Born in the USAÂ 
I was born in the USA now
Born in the USAÂ 
Im a long gone Daddy in the USA now
Born in the USAÂ

Aerial views of the ground
Freudian slumber empty of sound
Over the rooftops and houses
Lost as it tries to be seen
Fields of incentive covered with green
Mesmerized children are playing
Meant to be seen but not heard
Stop me from dreaming
Dont be absurd
Well if we can help you we will
Youre looking tired and ill
As I count backwards
Your eyes become heavier still
Sleep wont you allow yourself fall
Nothing can hurt you at all

I can experiment further still

Voices can faintly be heard
Please leave this patient undisturbed
Sentenced to drift far away now
Nothing is quite what it seems
Sometimes entangled in your own dreams

Well thanks to our kindness and skill
Youll have no trouble until
You catch your breath
And the nurse will present you the bill

8155,"Yo
We got broke niggas woke niggas who want smoke niggas
I fucked with Scott Storch so you know we got coke
Niggas fake with having Im lacing karats
Darlings in the states and Paris amazed the fabrics
I was rich when they wasnt still rich when you was
Men it is what it is Im a habitual plug
If I said it you say I was pathological
Got shot twice a night I checked myself out the hospital
I was pumping Keith Sweat had the gun in these sweats
Talks of killing his moms I couldnt live with regrets
Coco
Yooh yooh
So many bitches I swear Im a dickless
Now that the bags is different to talk different
Alright here we go
Yo here we go
Yo
So many bitches I swear Im a dickless
Now that the bags is bigger they talk different
She want the best life now so heres your wish miss
Weve been shitting or some about to do Christmas
Off white colored a truck to the hood love them toys
Aint no future and theres some good love and joy
Skin brown color on the joy
We mashed potatoes on the arms to avoid the noise
I told flex Im a thug man Im a die fly
Chanel forego 60 bands New Yorks flag
I chop the top off the Porshe when it we convert
My Cleopatra in Dubai try make me convert Im saying
Salam alaykom my uni country you know listen
Um
Trendsetters pristine boys niggas their ice
We woke up at the awards every rapper just like me
I inspire the bosses
Shit Ive been moving white like fire in crosses
No trump intended
Made me a menace thats work on the team playing when
Zach was on Memphis
When he win for the grounds real dont tell you how
Theres some other motherfucking clown will
And you could think spike for the motion pictures
A couple Jesus aint nice thats the frozen scriptures
Team rocking I mean Remi popping Drake popping
Pick and roll caught him M alone and Im Stockton
And you wonder why them niggas depress
We selling the same dope I just picture the best is coca
Uhhuh yeah
I done survive in the Bronx amongst killers and thieves
Hustled in the cold and below zero degrees
Id have seen shit that most probably wouldnt believe
So the second time on Flex fitting to be a breeze
Yo Flex respect to all these MCs stepping this far
The lyrical MCs please keep rapping them bars
The bar set they reach now Im resetting that bar
Promised yall by tomorrow Im gonna be mentioned with God
This is me catching the charge premeditated murder one
The cheese like my son the truth you never heard a son
Huh you heard Im fronting then somebody lied
You heard somebody did something to me somebody died
And if they didnt kill him bet somebody tried
So if hes still alive then God was on somebodys side
Somebody try to defined Myse no definition
One of the best cats thatspitting that get no recognition
I repping dudes sitting in prison when 90 something didnt numbers
And 90 summers to some of our closest friends from us
Dumb us we let these retreats not much
Jay Z tried tell us dont let this shit become us
What you see thats how they want us beef and fueling
Among us chasing the fame wearing the same chains that hung us
Then they lock us up for the same cane that brung us
We got to change the game but just maintain the hunger
The aim is getting younger theyre shooting at our babies now
Feminizing men dudes moving like ladies now
They said you sound like a hater sometimes I say
Nah I tell the truth is only hate when you lying
Theyve been waiting to find my kind
Divine being a shining McDonalds climax by just using my mind
Cuz nah I dont touch em see what they did to Russell
Some of these chicks done turning rape into hustle
Now have you really been assaulted and rape mind me I love you
I swear if I was there how to shot the coward for you
But listen Im trying to tell you that shit is a scam
They trying to divide the black women and men
So as the black man I stand right up here and I apologize
For that pain and neglect that left ya traumatize
You see when my father died I swear my mama tried
To turn me to a man I aint fell she is qualified
Thats why I went outside and I witnessed the homicides
And the drug dealers whoever was shooting we idolize
Thats why I despise when the rats got idolized
You played the game of snitch technical fault you disqualified
Nigga I defied them odds and I survived
Im 2Pac Shakur meets knowledge is modernized
They say that I provide a feeling thats undenied
Barring nobody I am the realest nigga alive
Your feelings then you died or you just dealing with pride
Yeah I know that I be spreading all bullshit and decides
For the minute that yall decide to celebrate authenticity
Every category you have its gonna mention me nigga
I gave him history facts bars consistently
How the hell they dont respect that its a mystery
So fuck yall listen they dont mean shit to me
Seeing my people revolve is my victory
Harry Belafonte well I call him Mr B
Said I had a gift God gave that gift to me
To lead the people from bondage and out of misery
Swami speak the truth to the Reaper come and visit me
You see my mission different thats why I see shit differently
Shit you might see a success I might disagree
Chick you might be paying for sex I might get for free
I think its lame to pay for sex but it might just be me
Maybe its just the grease levels and different leagues
Im war already thats why Im always in fatigue
Listen please dont get it confused because
Im elevating them switching my views and Im uplifting my dudes
I flip quick you get shit misconstrued
And I put a nigga in the clip on the news
So youre gonna choose which one you want me this preaching the unity
Or to me that be the reason your people reading your eulogy
I know its a contradiction understand its two of me
Its the goons Myse from the Bronx then its the new of me
Its the whole of me thats comfortable where the shooters be then the revolutionary newer version of Huey P
Flex can you agree that I did what I told you
I came up here and I shifted the culture they listening closer
They robbed me different they dont switch they approach up
That bullshit spitting is over now and they listened to Hova
444 tell me I aspire death Im flattered but I aint really buying that
But what I will say is that they wasnt jacking that kind of rap
Before I came up here stop me where Im lying at
Iron sharpens iron nigga I brought the fire back
I eat a tiger I brought lions that retired back
Real going admire that but the fake going down play
Swear these squares uncomfortable around me Why
Cuz I proudly point out they fraudulence
Then I expose these actors to their audience
Yall be ignorant that they dont move according to that shit that they recording and yall still applaud it me
Im reporting it live from the corners
When they do crime and get more time than Warner
You see Im trying to warn you its no more honor nah
They done trading these principles for designer
Your righthand man might kill you for some vagina
And the so called jeez get pistols to the minors
And this will yall be trying to compare to me
From where I swear this whole industry scared of me its clear
This shit its just like breathing enemies Im guard here
You should be making a prayer to me its rare
Youll see another rapper thats this complete
That speak like a scholar while honor like Pistol Pete
When his drama Im the piranha trying to get the meat pause
Im kind of like white collar mixed with street on my momma
Im just the lead Im not heart beat her the streets
I am the place where life and art seem to meet
See first I palm heat then I laid on Palm Beach
Now I got the world on my palm my song speak
And they stop looking they listen they pay attention
Because they be saying the same shit I just say it different
I just paint a picture of dimensions they cant mention
Cuz they aint bended it when they spit it it aint convincing
The image they predict aint the position
The image they predictable bars aint their position
Of course everybody gonna say they was in the kitchen
But what about the block getting locked facing that prison
When either you gonna tell what you wont sit in that cell
Everybody a G before that thats when its real
Now thats when you can tell the morals have finished still
When your back against the wall your character get revealed
So either you gon squeal and try to make you a deal
Or youre gonna pick 12 and you lose weight on the pill
I know that and going pill to a coward or civilian
With the Gs no I just kept with a million
Tell me how does it feel you sit witnessing greatness
The doubters is sick I know that haters gonna hate this
With the real rice been waiting for me to take this game
Back from the fake so please pardon my lateness but
I was busy fighting for freedom
These kids needed food for thought I had to feed them
They needed something to follow I had the lead em
Men of honour was becoming this thing I had to breed them
Chicks keep calling me God all in my DMs
No disrespect but God aint that your BM
Guess she realized your fraud
See a queen could tell the difference between a king
And the pawn when she see him
And yup I am here my motto is copper dim
Growing up in the Bronx and my heart darker than pm
And pool full of sharks I learned to swim
They hid their hands after they threw the rocks that I turned into gems
Nigga we turning men way before puberty shit
By age ten it wasnt nothing yall could do to me
America have ruined me Poverty real hunger
Oppression pain same shit that may kill Manga
And they still wonder what Im marching for
To identify allies when its time for war
Which Ill gonna do when they declare martial law
And then the soldier with guns knocking at your door huh
You aint even prepared
The revolution done starting you aint even aware
You see the Dred Scott case takes
We cant be free and these United States cause we aint even from here
Long as Im breathing this air until its even and fair
Ima fight cuz one thing I dont believe in its fear
I guess the reason Im here is to maintain the balance nigga
Im the place between peace and balance
Between screaming and silence ignorance acknowledge nigga
Just fighting off these demons is a challenge
It is the talent just keepin my composure
While you beef with me knowing I could fold you
Knowing if I told my soldier he would mow you
Down like a lawn you see is pros vs cons
Is knowing that Im in the right but its still wrong
Its chess why sacrifice the knight for a pawn
Yo flex Im gone before I leave your residence
I hope you realize this is black excellence
This is black brilliance black power resilience
The Black Panther not to film the real shit
This black Wall Street time to rebuild this
We need a thousand Oprahs and a thousand Will Smiths
We need celebrities of a higher pedigree
To have some integrity that one to leave a legacy
Shit Im fighting for Im probably aint gonna never see
But my kids will just hope today remember me
Hope today remember he defied the odds
He played the hand he was dealt never shuffle the cards
A1 since day one he never fuck with no frauds
He frontlined and never get you nothing but bars
Nothing but the uncut raw shit they make your nose bleed
The Bible verses the shit that niggas souls need
The OG told me it was designed to divide us brother
Cuz even in Wakanda we is fighting each other
So just imagine if we was all fighting together
We all be winning and all of our lives would be better
Good people died just so I can have a life
And thats why I give my life as a sacrifice
Good people died just so I can have a life
And thats why I gave my life as a sacrifice

For real
Erybodys a star erybody shine
Follow your heart and not mankind
For real for real
Im bout to do my thing to shine
So everybody Shine cmon
Its not luck that Im sittin here spittin for yall
Preordained by Allah that Im hittin for yall
Growin up on the New York concrete lookin
Lilke a little snotty dish of prodigy cookin
They called me Little Man all in the boulevard
When I was young my family used to party hard
Games of Run catch kiss turned to Run catch hump
The illest niggas was Richard Pryor and Ronnie Bump
Skinned knees from being badass little boys
Police sirens and baby screams was average noise
HipHop came the ghetto copped the soundtrack
Street poetry to tracks could you beat that
Malik Taylor introduced it to me
He said Forget Benny Hill nigga lets MC
Twelve years old rhymin in the back room
For echoes we used to rhyme in the bathroom
RunDMC Slick Rick and Doug E Fresh
The Juice Crew rule but whos this nigga KRS
Reference points too many to wish for
Battlin niggas on trains I stay raw
Never let my dream die
I was happy and high going to Alis in BedStuy
We made our first demo tape
Excited like a muhfucka lookin for our first break
I know you can do it
Be about it yall
Listen to the story I tell yo for real
I know you can see it
Use my life as an example
Do it and see it and be nobody else
Jungle Brothers De La they gave me little light
In Top Three Feet Buddy that was aiiight
One year later the Tribe was initiated
Bonita came it was wild how she dominated
Can I Kick It parlayed us to our next phase
So drunk in those days I truly was amazed
How I got up enough to make tunes
People cheered me
It was foreign then came Low End Theory
People quickly recognized who we are
Phife is ill and Busta is a superstar
Tours with PE Naughty and the Geto Boys
Arsenio Hall women then were evil toys
Whisperin hate inside my brothers virgin ears
Tryin to hurt but yo we stood amongst the tears
Midnight was even tighter now look at us
Condoms is on the rider stored on the bus
It got funky right here I had to save my life
In the snow after the show I had a fight wit Phife
Moved to a land to get away but back home
Jive was irkin us it sent me through a danger zone
The good thing I found Allah in the process
An angel appeared wit sneaky ways and gave me stress
Now what am I to do
My albums platinum but Im still feelin blue cmon
Yeah 
You can do it
Makin my way the wilderness has grown fierce
Gumption and my heart both of them was pierced
Crashed my truck didnt think Id make it out
Had a hit on my life he thought I screwed his wife
Plus my house burned down me and Ang was in it
My crew was tired and I knew we had to end it
But through all of this Im still here
Take notes and let hope floats
Im still here take note and let hope float
Im still here take notes and let hope float
You can do the same shit that Im doin
You can do the same thing that Im doin
Uhhuh
Im still here take note let ituhhah
Still here take notes and let it float aha
Still here takeand let it
You can do the same thing Im doin thing that Im doin

Sipping imaginary cola and drawing faces in the tabletop dust
His voice was rusty from years as a sergeant on this mans army
They were old and crusty
She was twenty when the diner was a baby
He was the dishwasher busy in the back his hands covered with gravy
Hair black and wavy
Brilliantine slick a pot cleaning dandy
He was young and randy
Day to day to day today
Then they were old their lives wasted away
Month to month year to year
They all run together
Time measured by the peeling of paint on the luncheonette wall
They sat together in the empty diner
Filled with cracked china
Old news was blowing across the filthy floor
And the sign on the door read this way out thats all it read
Thats all it said

3365,"I aint getting caught up in your damns of impression
No matter who the diva Im the verse for your oppression
Standing in my rightful place residing as it seems
That its earthed inside the dark hopefully you catch the gleam
You turn unto the village you can see how we get tranqued
Seems to pawn follow pawn and become the queens bank
Im not part of that I may be ghetto spack
But Im too smart to embark into the deadly traps
Never gettin glassy eye although glaucoma rarely follows
I pride myself as optimist but damn this place is hollow
Guess I better hit the grind fill my jams taut with substance
Sprinkle vibes around with result and abundance
Falling prey to categories can be black and abysmal
Damage to the aura which encases us like crystal
The raising of the bar is a part of repertoire
We gon edit negatives off this little black noir
Abstractionisms for your daily rhythmsnigga 
Peace everybody glad Ive got your attention
We drove the path of ease and steer clear of pretention
Now we riding high because the weight inside the trunk
Has been sifted with specifics its been shifted for the junk
Heres the funk and the anchor is the bass that make you wiggle
Dont overanalyze it its no need for you to niggle
I stand inside my power like a knight inside the court
Everybody follow suit if its rigid dont abort
Its heavenly somebody sound the reveille
The day is starting in the rhythms highest pedigree
I got the beat reverberating and energys on 10
Sending soundwaves through orals I revitalize the den
Or deep its still TM everybodys got it in them
Dont hold these words as boring even though you all are snoring

",Abstractionisms for your daily rhythmsnigga Peace everybody glad Ive got your attention We drove the path of ease and steer clear of pretention Now we riding high because the weight inside the trunk Has been sifted with specifics its been shifted for the junk Heres the funk and the anchor is the bass that make you wiggle Dont overanalyze it its no need for you to niggle I stand inside my power like a knight inside the court Everybody follow suit if its rigid dont abort Its heavenly somebody sound the reveille The day is starting in the rhythms highest pedigree I got the beat reverberating and energys on 10 Sending soundwaves through orals I revitalize the den Or deep its still TM everybodys got it in them Dont hold these words as boring even though you all are snoring Constantly restoring cause we living and we breathing Im injected and infected with this premise Im not leaving,I aint getting caught up in your damns of impression No matter who the diva Im the verse for your oppression Standing in my rightful place residing as it seems That its earthed inside the dark hopefully you catch the gleam You turn unto the village you can see how we get tranqued Seems to pawn follow pawn and become the queens bank Im not part of that I may be ghetto spack But Im too smart to embark into the deadly traps Never gettin glassy eye although glaucoma rarely follows I pride myself as optimist but damn this place is hollow Guess I better hit the grind fill my jams taut with substance Sprinkle vibes around with result and abundance Falling prey to categories can be black and abysmal Damage to the aura which encases us like crystal The raising of the bar is a part of repertoire We gon edit negatives off this little black noir

I say to thee well count your blessings 
I remember when I used to get depressed
Overwhelmed by the stress
Feeling my life was the illest mess
Always dwelling on the stuff that wasnt right
And staring at the four walls in my room all night
Searching for a way to cope
The situation shaky like Im walkin on a tightrope
But now I see its time to get a handle
And take control of things
So for me Imma light a candle
And other people got it worse
I get a lot of love so I ought give my thanks first
Too many times I felt bad count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had

Too many times I felt bad count your blessings 
Too many times I couldnt see what really I had
I said you better count your blessings 
Too many times I asked Why me
And I recall when things werent goin how they sposed to be
Yeah I know you dig what Im relayin
And now I find myself devoting more time to praying
I aint saying that I dont do no wrong
Im saying I aint trying to sing no more sad songs
I got mad responsibilities
Im building with my family my loved ones depend on me
Ive got no time for envy nor for hate
My inner powers too strong
To let such evil penetrate
The world around is in chaos
But Id rather seek the truth to be found
Than to be lost
Experience is always the best teacher
Look at the signs feel the vibes Im tryin to reach ya
I see how much now that one should be grateful for
And we must help the others who cant find a open door

Now as we head into the year 2000
And more and more people cant even get decent housing
Poor education in the schools
And poor employment structures so some choose illegal tools
By all means you know we must survive but think
The energy we give always comes back to us in time
We must decide to make the proper choices
Or the only thing well hear is the cries and the screaming voices
Too many times too many times
Too many times too many times
Too many times too many times
Too many times too many times
Too many times I felt bad

White leather seats as fresh as Air Forces
I say Im doing bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on NWA Straight Outta Compton
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering Whats happening the kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
I aint Hollywood I come from the hood Im used to it
So if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Daytons got the Chevrolet skatin makin
I make a million and Im satisfied Ill get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tightest ride I want the best
I refuse to get a 9 to 5 Id rather flip my keys
Been paying my dues ever since 89 tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when Im on the scene they know its me
Aint no dream or no fantasy bitch its TIP
Broad busting like a baby do a binky
Five karat VVSs on my mothafuckin pinky
Half of Hennessy and Belvederes what we drinking
Pimp squad send for broads what the hell you niggas thinking
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when Im riding cause Im balling
Im calling out shots like a pool shark
My tool sparks in the dark when I fool marks
Yall fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But Imma get that ass hauled off fuck around with the clique
Theyll be looking for your dick with a stick nigga yall soft
So yall lost Imma ball out at all costs spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang til she falls off and sucks balls off I got the

Want to act right now get smacked right now

Clown down here fakin frontin talking bout what you making nothin

But the family Bible on the table

And when the evening meal was done

And wed count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sitting round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me

I can see you
You need to see me

You didnt notice I was there

And not to me

Your liberty

See myself from a distance
I cant get back inside

All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died

Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear

So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear

And youre the only thing matters

Shell give you some brain you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain shell throw you some cot
Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said its a wrap she still on the set
Puttin oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she Wouldnt get far cause five hundred dollars
Cant get you that Far how you get that Far 
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they dont know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards ha ha
You wouldnt get far fuckin them rap stars

And aint nobody tryin to take Beyonc from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin on they face

On that superhero shit

3663,"What Am I Gonna Do Im So in Love with You Lyrics
Can I tell you what you mean to me
Youre as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe that youre mine
Youre like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
Yes you are
Something youve got is something I need right now
You dont have to prove it no more
Im down on my bended knees honey
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
One in a million oh so rare
A nightingale in Berkeley Square
And baby I aint goin nowhere without you
You are the goal that wins the game
The very last bus home in the rain
Youre like rock and roll and champagne
All in one
Something youve got is something I need right now
Lets not mess around anymore
Im down on my bended knees honey
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
Ill be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you any time
The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrows fashion and now Ive found you
Im complete
Something youve got is something I need right now
You dont have to prove it no more
Im down on my bended knees honey
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
Im like a schoolboy in your hands
I wanna get up and sing and dance
You see one hell of a happy man standing here
Individually quite unique
You really swept me off my feet
And baby you look oh so neat
With nothing on
",I gonna do Im so in love with you What am I gonna say if ever you go away What am I gonna do Im so in love with you What am I gonna say if ever you go away Ill be a sleek one of a kind And so difficult to define I could drink a case of you any time The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel tower A national anthem an April shower Tomorrows fashion and now Ive found you Im complete Something youve got is something I need right now You dont have to prove it no more Im down on my bended knees honey What am I gonna do Im so in love with you What am I gonna say if ever you go away Im like a schoolboy in your hands I wanna get up and sing and dance You see one hell of a happy man standing here Individually quite unique You really swept me off my feet And baby you look oh so neat With nothing on,What Am I Gonna Do Im So in Love with You Lyrics Can I tell you what you mean to me Youre as central as the air I breathe Almost impossible to believe that youre mine Youre like weekends all year long Under a hot Jamaican sun You are a winner at a hundred to one Yes you are Something youve got is something I need right now You dont have to prove it no more Im down on my bended knees honey What am I gonna do Im so in love with you What am I gonna say if ever you go away One in a million oh so rare A nightingale in Berkeley Square And baby I aint goin nowhere without you You are the goal that wins the game The very last bus home in the rain Youre like rock and roll and champagne All in one Something youve got is something I need right now Lets not mess around anymore Im down on my bended knees honey What am

Cold kicking ass 
Cold kicking ass

Funky fresh EazyE 
Pull up a chair and Ima tear shit up 
I dont drink brass monkey like the beat funky
Nickname EazyE yo 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kicking to show my shit
Rapper holdin my dick boy I dont quit
And if aint rap then you know its crap
Crowd rocking sucka stomper from around the way
I got a sixshooter yo mean hombre
E rolling out to find the Boyz
To kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my tail I dont like jail
40 ounce in my lap and and its cold as hell
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself they can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the eight in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gayes Greatest Hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the Eastside South of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at her face and the bitch was to the curb
But she was on my tip for the title Im holding
EazyEs getting busy got the 8ball rolling
I wascold kicking ass
I wasraised in LA
I wascruising down the street in my sixfour
Too much posse
Riding on Slausson looking for Crenshaw
Turned down the sounds to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tip cause I was drunk
See a sissy ass punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause its like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title Im holding
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 Ball rolling
Fuck it up yall

Fuck the police and a 502
Stepped in the party I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said Eric yo breath smells
40 ounce in hand thats what I got
Yo man you see Eazy hurling in the parking lot
Stepped on your foot cold dissed your ho
Asked her to dance and she said Hell no
Called her a bitch because thats the rule
Boyznthe hood trying to keep me cool
Tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get em up
I started dropping the dogs and watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum got knocked out cold
Make you look sick you snotty nosed prick
Now your fly bitches all over his dick
Punk got dropped cause the title Im holding
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Yo pass the brew Ren while I tear shit up
And yall listen up close to roll call
EazyEs in the place I got money and juice
RonDeVus with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so funk funk funky
Do the Olde 8 forget the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
Hail to the niggas from CIA
Krazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams so fuck respect
Make a toast all you punk to the title Im holding
EazyEs breaking out and got the 8ball rolling

6992,"Yo this joint right here is dedicated to all them grimy cats
Thatll stab you in the back nah mean
Disloyal ass niggas all in your business
Snake in the grass ass hoes peeped your stash
You aint goin nowhere snake
See you check it
I hate a nigga all up in your business
Tryin to finally confine about you yo what is this
Damn nigga do you work for the Source I hope they pay you millions
Cause you act like you takin the place of Wendy Williams nigga
I see you in front of my crib in the dark
Lurkin and waitin to see whos car was parked
It aint your chick so why you care for
Why you stop and stare for what you there for
Do you need to know every single thing about my life
Its not enough that I rap and sing about my life
Even when Im sleep you got nothin else to do
But call up your man whos a bitch nigga just like you
Talkin bout my business like it aint nothin
Yall have a two hour discussion on who I might be fuckin
Cats with these feminine ways and traits
Just one example of the type of niggas I hate cmon
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight
These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate
I hate them niggas who just kiss ass
So they can move up in the game like quick fast and they get gassed
Now they walkin round like they so down
Cause they workin up at Motown but slow down nigga
Yall motherfuckers is the worst kind
And I know youre probably hearin this here for the first time
But Imma say that shit other rappers just wont say
Think about it feel it inside but just dont say
Keep them fake hugs when you come in the place
And when I see you Imma say this directly into your face
Yall some fake niggas except now you got a name
And this applies to half of these niggas up in this game
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I had to get a pen and just write this shit down cmon
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight
These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate
I hate bitches that be frontin like they got your back
But when the jump off crack you see its not like that
Certain chicks put the S in snake
Try to give a bitch a break wanna test your weight
Let em stay in your crib even take your whip
Might even babysit while they playin the strip
Kinda chick want to smile up and call you sis
Cant even bring your man around shorty tsk tsk 
Call your moms mom even wear your clothes
Thats why I gotta give it up to them honest hoes
You know what they about from the gate
Stay in there place heres another type of broad I hate What type 
Type to put all of your business in the street uhhuh 
Thats why I only got a handful of peeps
Closely analyze all the new ones I meet
2001 bitches I aint too beat
There you have it
Just a few of examples
And if you cant relate to this shit right here
Chances are youre the type of motherfuckers were talkin about
Ya heard
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight

1870,"No More Mr Nice Guy Lyrics
I used to be such a sweet sweet thing
Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They cant be seen with me
And Im gettin real shot down
And Im feeling mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say hes sick hes obscene
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They cant be seen with me
And Im feelin real shot down
And Im Im gettin mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say hes sick hes obscene
My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eyes Nice guy 
Mas been thrown out of the social circle
And dad has to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose the Reverend Smith
He he recognized me
And punched me in the nose he said
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said youre sick youre obscene
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said youre sick youre obscene

6459,"P is for the city
P is for P is for for the city
P is for for the ci ci city
P is for P is for the city where it all began
Im an Ernest Hemingway portrait painted by Ernie Barnes
Clean sneakers and dirty horns last soldier of thirty gone
Who lost hope but still journeyed on
Yet Im the reason we gon have to get the gurney for him
Karma police carrying customized cuffs for me
I hope these taped up gunsll still bust for me
I had the whole world it wasnt enough for me
It got me feelin like the Lord lost trust for me
I made a means to an end when there were no wins
I burned bridges I had sworn to be eternal friends
The last ones I ever intended to turn against
Until we grew our separate ways like fraternal twins
So to the chosen few with whom I need to reconcile
My mothers mother my only brother my second child
Ive always loved you although that was rarely said aloud
So take forever I guess better late than never proud
Im gonna breathe in the bellows with the apple on my head
Its hard to gain perspective with the world in your hands
Gonna drown in the shallows ashes in the bay
Never lookin back until theres nothin in my way
Yo identify with the dead or the livin I dont know
Maybe my people set up to fall like a domino
America the beautiful go ask Geronimo
Whats the worst they could do to you I bet my mama know
I bet my father know your Honord throw the book at us
Even if justice wasnt blind shed never look at us
I want that clutch of what I could not touch
I was tryna get what I could get before I get locked up
And when that death clock struck
I was depressed enough to go ahead and press my luck
They held me down so long I figured I should just rise up
Like helium from the delirium
Tryna change my skin color like a chameleon
But are my best years of life behind or still ahead of me
What would I leave behind if I was over everything
The foundation for creation of a better me
Thats honestly the true definition of legacy do it
Im gonna breathe in the bellows with the apple on my head
Its hard to gain perspective with the world in your hands
Gonna drown in the shallows ashes in the bay
Devil on my back and theres a demon in my way
God damn it I said now
Told you once cant fool me twice
Hate to be the bearer of bad advice
What I see before my eyes bear witness
P is P is for the city P is for
Fuel the fire P is for for the city P is for for the for the city 
To light the path of least resistance
P is for the city for for the city
Resistance
Yo they say my seed is a future threat thats all too correct
For that two fifths of a man that barrel to your neck
God damn it the hot hammer get all due respect
For the young cell block cannon that calls you collect
After runnin multiple rings like the Dream Team
Tryna breathe and touch keys like Kaseem Dean
Supreme cream his hands so dirty it seemed clean
Scream murder watchin 30 for 30 here go the theme nigga
Im gonna breathe in the bellows with the apple on my head
Its hard to gain perspective with the world in your hands
Gonna drown in the shallows with the lovebirds in the bay
Never lookin back until theres nothin in my way
P is for the city for the
P is for for for for the city

5909,"Okay so it might appear
To an outsider that you found your way up out of here
Theyre saying you died of suicide
Thats the last thing I want to hear
They tell me that its hardly fair to blame myself
What a hell of a cross to bare
You didnt say it in your letter
But the fact that I failed you is loud and clear
Found out the amount of fear
You would drown when you found yourself naked staring down a mirror
And partners are supposed to lay the cards bare
I left you playing solitaire and I promise you that Im sincere
If youre looking for some judgment you wont find it here
Lets be honest here
I cant say Ive never known that kind of despair
When the clouds appear hows life fair
I just want to draw you near
Not to make it about me but how could you check out
Before you really allowed me a chance to sit down and hear
I think I wouldve listened
Or were you saying it all along and I just missed it
You sang your swan song we all dismissed it
Because you filled the room with laughter
I watched when you thought no one was looking at you
In hind sight I wonder where your smile went
When the party ended and you swallowed it
I saw you swallow it
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many cries soak through your disguise
Before you drown in your silent tears
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many times can you fight for your life
Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many cries soak through your disguise
Before you drown in your silent tears
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
How many times can you fight for your life
Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer
Ive had car accidents
Where everything is slow motion no matter how fast its happening
Every second that pass stretches so that you can watch it unraveling
But cant always react to it
Your whole life might flash before your eyes
The minute when you transition to the other side
But what can actually happen in that time
Inbetween the leaping and the moment you collide
Inbetween the trigger and the blast
Inbetween you let go of the wheel and you crash
Inbetween the moment when you swallow the last pill in the bottle
Turn out the lights roll the dice on tomorrow
Is there a moment to reflect can there be regret
Is there a wait not yet let me reset
Or is it just too painful to accept
That maybe death just seemed best
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
If you not winning you can go down swinging
Even if it doesnt feel like theyre fighting fair
Okay so it might appear
That you took yourself up out of here
Im trying not to resent you
But you left me defenseless in the life we share
Every man before me in my fam died by his own hands
How am I supposed to understand my own role in the plan
When nobody who grows old stands a chance
What about this mysterious dance
Made you cut the cord to the curtain in advance
But these are questions I can only ask
The person looking back in the looking glass
",here How many cries soak through your disguise Before you drown in your silent tears Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here How many times can you fight for your life Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer Ive had car accidents Where everything is slow motion no matter how fast its happening Every second that pass stretches so that you can watch it unraveling But cant always react to it Your whole life might flash before your eyes The minute when you transition to the other side But what can actually happen in that time Inbetween the leaping and the moment you collide Inbetween the trigger and the blast Inbetween you let go of the wheel and you crash Inbetween the moment when you swallow the last pill in the bottle Turn out the lights roll the dice on tomorrow Is there a moment to reflect can there be regret Is there a wait not yet let me reset Or is it just too painful to accept That maybe death just seemed best Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here If you not winning you can go down swinging Even if it doesnt feel like theyre fighting fair Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here Im trying not to resent you But you left me defenseless in the life we share Every man before me in my fam died by his own hands How am I supposed to understand my own role in the plan When nobody who grows old stands a chance What about this mysterious dance Made you cut the cord to the curtain in advance But these are questions I can only ask The person looking back in the looking glass,Okay so it might appear To an outsider that you found your way up out of here Theyre saying you died of suicide Thats the last thing I want to hear They tell me that its hardly fair to blame myself What a hell of a cross to bare You didnt say it in your letter But the fact that I failed you is loud and clear Found out the amount of fear You would drown when you found yourself naked staring down a mirror And partners are supposed to lay the cards bare I left you playing solitaire and I promise you that Im sincere If youre looking for some judgment you wont find it here Lets be honest here I cant say Ive never known that kind of despair When the clouds appear hows life fair I just want to draw you near Not to make it about me but how could you check out Before you really allowed me a chance to sit down and hear I think I wouldve listened Or were you saying it all along and I just missed it You sang your swan song we all dismissed it Because you filled the room with laughter I watched when you thought no one was looking at you In hind sight I wonder where your smile went When the party ended and you swallowed it I saw you swallow it Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here How many cries soak through your disguise Before you drown in your silent tears Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of here How many times can you fight for your life Before you throw that white flag up and volunteer Okay so it might appear That you took yourself up out of

Lord forgive him he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Themamurder me so I gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performing procedures
Jesus I aint trying to be facetious but
Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord you said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping Brown Sugar by DAngelo
In Los Angeles like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe being good Catholics Im coming

Spray from the HecklerKoch automatic
All the static shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical I throw couple at you take six
Spread love to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis till I head above
Yessir and when I perish the meek shall inherit the Earth

Like Don Bishop the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebodys cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
Ill let you see where that bright light leads you
The more you talk the more you irking us
The more you gon need memorial services
The Black Album second verse is like
Devils pie save some dessert for us
Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They wont be happy til somebody die
Oh man I gotta get my soul right
Fore Im locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems its alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
Let me get serious for yall one second 
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bobs killer
Asking him why as my eyes fill up
These days I cant wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten homes I still feel ya
So curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are Bobalob
Lord forgive him we all have sinned
But Bobs a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning thanks again

Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
In God we trust cry it out loud
Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead
The burden of blood the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake
Lord above my spirit says
Death is not proud no more no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory
Wither a pain thats almost a joy
Wander there my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Stranger no wonder memories remain
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger one
Sent to do reckoning what must be done
Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty freedom maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause done faithfully
Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay
Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now embrace it my friend
Spirits cry for a god from the grave
In darkness fortune favours the brave
Dying a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal for he will live evermore
Dying a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal for he will live evermore
Think I am that Im almost there
Following now the depths of despair
Beyond the light darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all
Falling now where God cant explain
Bidding farewell a lifeline again
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the Celts

I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war
I dreamed I saw a mighty room
The room was filled with men
And the paper they were signing said
Theyd never fight again
And when the papers all were signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below
Were dancing round and round
And guns and swords and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

We dont know how to be alone

And wind up following the wrong gods home

And they keep answering that bell

Meets a violent farewell

They dont smell so sweet

The heaven lying at your feet
There are so many contradictions
In all these messages we send
We keep asking 
How do I get out of here
Where do I fit in
Though the world is torn and shaken
Even if your heart is breaking
Its waiting for you to awaken
And someday you will

3662,"The fields are always wet with rain
After a summer shower when I saw you standin
Standin in the garden
In the garden wet with rain
You wiped the teardrops from your eye in sorrow
As we watched the petals fall down to the ground
And as I sat beside you I felt the
Great sadness that day in the garden
And then one day you came back home
You were a creature all in rapture
You had your key to your soul
And you did open that day you came back to the garden
The olden summer breeze was blowin against your face
Alright 
The light of the Lords shinin on your countenance divine
And you were a violet colour as you
Sat beside your father and your mother in the garden
The summer breeze was blowin on your face
Within your violet you treasure your summery words
And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine
Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden
And you went into a trance
Your childlike vision became so fine
And we heard lil bells within the church
We loved so much
And felt the presence of the youth of
Eternal summers in the garden
Alright 
And as it touched your cheeks so lightly
Born again you were and blushed
And we touched each other lightly
And we felt the presence of the Christ
Within our hearts in the garden
And I turned to you and I said
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father in the garden
Listen
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
In the garden wet with rain
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
In the garden

Yeah alright
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature

6280,"Wait a Minute Freestyle Lyrics
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a goddamn minute
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait one fucking minute
Im looking at your year end list
Youre choosing rappers youre friends with
Who be rapping what their friends did
Toolie ratchets and extensions
Wait wait wait a minute
We done already heard their best shit
We already got the message
They on a lean molly Percocet trip
Think I found what real success is
Running around here since The Message
Forty pounder full of death wish
Money counter full of blessings
I sent a cannonball right out the cannon barrel
Through your wall closet through your damn apparel
Through your grandma chair through your granite countertop
And I aint tryna stop it til you standing on the doorstep
Of the man upstairs nigga youre next
Wait a minute nigga
Ive been going crazy on these records way before Flex
This the bad half Shady vortex armed in navy warfare
Yall them Barnum Bailey boys
Best to back the fuck up or get smacked the fuck up eighty million different ways
If I say its fuck the world then the worlds getting fucked
Eighty million different ways when Im finished with it
Then the worlds gon get the AIDS like some 1984 sex
This the traumatize your favorite rapper year
This the homicide related racketeer
All Im tryna hear today is trap and drill
Its all downhill from here like Jack and Jill wait
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
Im giving all my hoes an ultimatum she my mascot
Im just tryna motivate her Im just popping
Shes just getting ass shot like a Soulja Boy home invader
I get a whole clip to all my haters
Just so I could go and get exonerated
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I watch you niggas go tool up
Im Compton menace on school bus
Its documented boy prove what
Been dropping gems since I grew up
I got to fill this void move bruh
The targets been destroyed boo ya
These nerds rapping for attention
For a word from Vlad or Akademik
Prefer to slap you over engine
Im Murs rapping for the Guinness
Wait wait wait a minute
I know you heard Im back in business
Im going harder than Tha Carter X
Im birds flapping independent
Im tycooning through the pressure
Im typhooning through this weather
I might do a nigga beat for em
Give it back to him a little PHresher
Got the cash holding on line two Brinks truck noise on one
Casanova with the rifle fuckboy dont run
Im live from it with the streams
Buying guns and getting beams
You guys coming with your teams
Its feeling like iFunny with the memes
I flip the blade like say something
Around dough like Rajon
Let you rip the stage then I come and rip the stage
Down more like Trey Songz
Category slaughter gang shit
Feel me nigga this is God hustle
Phantom or the Vette
Tomi Lahren Charlamagne shit the odd couple
Wait wait wait a minute
Im primal if Im fuckin mating with her
I bend her over stick her on the expensive car
Tyler fucking Creator with it
You a lame you from Twitter fame
You had a chain thats your nigga chain
Face down on your computer key sleep
Closest you gon be to laying in your name
Body bag after body bag
Leave a trail laying in your lane
Im Cold Chillin on the record business
But I aint saying I distribute Kane
Wait a motherfucking minute
You popping molly with the actors
I fucked the baddest of the white bitches
Im Talib Kweli with the blackness
Im most def with immigration
Ladies on top of ladies
Im Mos Def with immigration
Babies on top of babies
Wait a motherfucking minute

Now heres what I want yall to do for me 
Back caught you lookin for the same thing
Its a new thing check out this I bring
Uh oh the roll below the level cause Im livin low
Next to the bass Cmon turn up the radio
They claiming Im a criminal
But now I wonder how some people never know
The enemy could be their friend guardian
Im not a hooligan I rock the party and
Clear all the madness Im not a racist
Preach to teach to all Cause some they never had this 
Number one not born to run about the gun
I wasnt licensed to have one
The minute they see me fear me
Im the epitome of public enemy
Used abused without clues
I refuse to blow a fuse
They even had it on the news

Yes was the start of my last jam
So here it is again another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics you can hang em Ill hold the rope
But they hope to the Pope and pray it aint dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Dont tell me that you understand until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane insane
Yes to them but to me Im a different kind
Were brothers of the same mind unblind
Caught in the middle and not surrendering
I dont rhyme for the sake of riddling
Some claim that Im a smuggler
Some say I never heard of ya a rap burglar
False media we dont need it do we
Its fake thats what it be to ya dig me

My 98 booming with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks cant stop the dunk
Coming from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate they drink Clorox
Attack the Black because I know they lack exact
The cold facts and still they try to Xerox
The leader of the new school uncool
Never played the fool just made the rules
Remember theres a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a time bomb
In the daytime radios scared of me
Cause Im mad plus Im the enemy
They cant come on and play me in prime time
Cause I know the time cause Im getting mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know Im living right so here go the micsike
Before I let it go dont rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to Herb yo if you cant swing this
Learn the words you might sing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it defy it I swing Bolos
And then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that some media is the wack
As you believe its true
It blows me through the roof
Suckers liars get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
From them I say dont believe the hype
Yo Chuck they must be on the pipe right 
Their pens and pads Ill snatch cause Ive had it
Im not a addict fiending for static
Ill see their tape recorder and I grab it
No you cant have it back silly rabbit 
Im going to my media assassin
Harry AllenI gotta ask him
Yo Harry youre a writerare we that type

Yeah boy part two bum rush the show 
Yo Griff get the green black and red and
Gold down countdown to Armageddon
88 you wait the S1s will
Put the left in effect and I still will
Rock the hard jams treat it like a seminar
Reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard
Some say Im negative but theyre not positive
But what I got to give The media says this 
Red black and green you know what I mean
Yo dont believe that hype
They got to be beaming that pipe you know what Im saying
Yo them Megas got em going up to see Captain Kirk
Like a jerk and they outta work
Let me tell you a little something man
A lot of people on daytime radio scared of us
Because they too ignorant to understand the lyrics of the
Truth that we pumping into them cloggedup brain cells
That just spun their little wooden skulls they call caps
You know what Im saying
But the S1sll straighten it out quickfast in a hurry
Dont worry Flavor vision aint blurry you know what Im saying

Since day one niggas doubted the Don
Cause I was anon now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond
Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated
Quadriplegic any squad that wanna squabble when Im heated
Not even God can believe it the way we regulate
And levitate heavyweight niggas like they was featherweight
Every day I do the same thing
Its the paid game to amputate more body parts than gangrene
Yo this a mans game its a shame how niggas truly mock me
But who can stop me from breakin niggas off like Fujiyaki
My crews probably the only niggas that really live the lyrics
Niggas really fear us they mustve heard we really killers
Were Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters
And army colors Willie niggas that laundry dollars
Im Nostradamus predictin the future my position is crucial
With a nonfiction obsession addiction to shoot ya
Hey yo Im better off dead than givin the feds the satisfaction
Subtracting my freedom have me missin in action
A fraction of yall raw like Colt to the jaw
The rest of yall fear war and couldnt follow out the protocol
Joe the God is like the angel of death strangle your neck
Thats why Don Cartagenas the name you respect
Ill leave a pain in your chest thatll make you question your threshold
Flex like you bench four still bless you like a chest cold
We destined to explode thats why I stay on flip mode
You dick rode me long enough Dunn now you can let go
X2
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im deadly and there aint no gettin rid of me
Uh uh uh yo
Somebody hold me back Joey Cracks about to load the gat
And blow this track to the stars like the zodiac
Hold me back this max n better out for the ass n cheddar
But fast cash dont last forever
I asked the felons if I dont stay wrapped in leathers
And hats with feathers I got all the ostriches acting jealous
Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras
Two hundred inch Mickey Thompsons flown back from Paris
Dat dats the illest these body tracks make a rap killings
Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings
My destiny was to shine to climb
Especially in time with the recipe in mind
From the jump start they aint have to pump heart in this
I was a part of this and marvelous stats it wasnt hard to miss
And yo I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue
Whose on my menu A record deal they couldnt lend you
I had to burn my Glock and earn my spot
The time flew by had to turn my clock
And start with a new resume I run into that bitch named Desree
She aint believe my dream was a better way
Prospectll have to collect dough
Diallin 905 to LAX with somethin I was trying to drive
A life thats trife for what I wore in the fuckin 
A thug in pain I swear to my little cousins grave
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im deadly and there aint no gettin rid of me
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree

Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
Shes waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the SevenEleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut em up and then we shut em down
Tonight tonight the strips just right
I wanna blow em off in my first heat
Summers here and the time is right
For racin in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Now some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
Then go racin in the street
Tonight tonight the strips just right
I wanna blow em all out of their seats
Were calling out around the world
Were going racin in the street
I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from LA
I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
But now theres wrinkles around my babys eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs Baby did you make it all right
She sits on the porch of her daddys house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shutdown strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me were gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the highways bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
Cause summers here and the time is right
For racin in the street

The living dead live in a nigga head behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka Ima take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yo thanks a lot Im a bottledrinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Aint nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
Thats when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked Is youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real bro
I got some skeletons locked in the closet Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
I thought I had it all locked away til forever
But no memories fade away they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then whys the pain still with me
Uh
See the problem is I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really theres no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed Im much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 247 dog thats my department
Inter city blues cruise and Im blasting that Marvin
Skeletons aint in my closet thats my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
Its all bleak to me tell my Pop I aint bothered
When he dont speak to me I love you but its weak to me
On one hand life is short and theres no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog Im kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam judge but you dont understand
Me against the world I plan on winning know Im undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here just take care of half the rent
I got some skeletons locked in the closet Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

2650,"School Day Ring Ring Goes The Bell Lyrics
Up in the mornin and out to school
The teacher is teachin the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You study em hard and hopin to pass
Workin your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you wont leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchrooms ready to sell
Youre lucky if you can find a seat
Youre fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
Gee but the teacher dont know how mean she looks
Soon as three oclock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something thats really hot
With the one you love youre makin romance
All day long you been wanting to dance
Feelin the music from head to toe
Round and round and round you go
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something thats really hot
With the one you love youre makin romance
All day long you been wanting to dance
Feelin the music from head to toe
Round and round and round you go
Hail hail rocknroll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rocknroll
The beat of the drum is loud and bold
Rock rock rocknroll
The feelin is there body and soul

6764,"Yeah gotta say whats up to my nigga Slick Rick
For those who dont like it eat a dick
But for those who with me sing that shit
As it go a little something like this
Lodi Dodi we likes to party
We dont cause trouble we dont bother nobody
Were just some niggas whore on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic right 
For all my Doggs keepin yall in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause its cool when you cause the cozy condition in
Which we create cause thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 oclock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said Um mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top dog of them all
There was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true Thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my allblue Chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my Indo
Then I dilly dally I ran through a alley 
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley 
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said um
Its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Damn now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break it up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying Why dont you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept goin
The bitch been around before my mothers born
I said Cheer up and I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin
I says Im 19 she says Stop lyin
I says I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover
Yeah uh ticktock ya dont stop
And to the uh ticktock nya dont quit
Yeah nya ticktock ya dont stop
And to the uh ticktock nya dont quit

Lets take it to the basics you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces aint no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it thats just a understatement
Im early to the party but my Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Lifes a mothafucka aint it These other rappers aint us

You aim it fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
Its just me myself and I and mothafuckas that I came with

I set out on the road
Seekin my fame and fortune
And lookin for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
Rode in on the Greyhound
Ill be walkin out if I go
I was just passin through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord Im stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
I ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar
For every song I sung
Every time Ive had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know Id catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again

You only gave me five dollars
I gave you twenty mother fuckin dollars
No you didnt You only gave me five dollars
No I gave you twenty and I aint gon sit here and argue with your flatass face home girl
This is America
You know thats the thing about you mother fuckers
Go home
I aint goin no where til I get my mother fuckin change
I will blow this mother fucker up if I dont get my mother fuckin change
Speaking Japanese
Mocking Japanese
I want my mother fuckin change
What happened in hiphop that got Pac and Big shot
The thicks blocks now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun and know to run than get shot
Ive been there before now Im fuckin with Doc
Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers 
If not I pitch rocks anticipatin my incarceration
Media think Im fakin like Mason but when it comes to mace
Fuck R Kelly I dont take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it and Im puttin you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest Catholic or Baptist pastor can save him
Im far from religious but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops
Im Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate All Eyez On Me
Im still at it Illmatic and thats The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate All Eyez On Me
Im still at it Illmatic and thats The Documentary
If I die my niggas
Fuck it I did a song with Mary Blige my niggas
Got a hook from Faith no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover Moni Love I was talkin to Ja
With that Maybach line it was payback time
Keep fuckin with me nigga Ill put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 300 Zs
If you cross my T Ill dot your eyes
Youll do life in a cemetery Ill do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Forces middle finger up fuck the world
Cause Im feelin like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo money mo problems and I lost my best friend
Im the second dopest nigga from Compton youll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story 
Uh Oh
You got a line that says
I dont do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs
Is that a shot at Jay 
Nah I was talkin about Ja Rule
Yeah so I mean I justII got a lot of respect for Jay
You know what Im sayin
I never take shots at legends
I justthats just somethin I dont do
Let me tell you why I do this shit
Im a son of a gun cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes Busta son duke is sick 
The protg of Doc Dre I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts sunk like quicksand
Dont stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed Im the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I aint Game and I dont know Dre
You goin do me like Xzibit and cut half my face
I take all the credit for puttin the West back on the map
If you aint feelin that guess Im Guerrilla Black
Im Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt

Loso and Drizzy baby
Uh uh we up in Barneys goin dumb again
Every time we leave the manager say come again
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back I make her feel young again
If her card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They dont give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him tell me thats her baby
I hope that I never meet him that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah she say she lucky that she his
No Im lucky that you mine baby you know what it isssss

If they ask how much tell em what its lookin like
Everything I buy fly its like Im bookin flights
If I want it Im a get it that should not be tooken light
And thats on everything I got a crazy lady
So Money Aint A Thang JayZ JD

Yeah
LOX nigga
It dont stop
It keep goin and goin and goin and goin
Motherfuckers
You heard it from the P you oughta know its the truth
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like its only a rap
Cause when these bullets hit yo ass Im like its only a gat
I need a funeral to feel good Im hoping its yours
Think he religious Heard he got shot in the Cross
Holiday Styles bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche or flip to the boots stick to the truth
Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missing a tooth but both of em chipped toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble I start most of the shit
When I squeeze aint no controlling the wrist
And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowing to Swizz
Im an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack bust guns pop shit and say Im better than niggas
You think not Ill look at your man and level a nigga
If you think a rappers better why dont you give me his name
So I can run up on him tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets Im the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters but Im bigger than yall
If I left the gun home Im a give you the sword
Im the devil in the flesh I cant give you the Lord
It dont make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib you oughta pray for your wife
Uh huh holiday
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
Holiday
And I dont care if I sell yall know what I sell
Holiday
I use my left hand when Im loading the shells
Holiday
Cause I know it aint right thats why Im blowing the L
Yo
I do it all for my niggas even ride with a bomb
Get shot die in his arm and give him my last
Its a million dollar bail Im a get it in cash
I sell crack like its 88 I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun live in the Maz
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple fifties of hash
Hundreds of dro wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor catch me right next to the dog
Im Holiday Styles and thats what the weaponry for
And I probably wont blow for the fact that Im hard
But Im good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Getting jewels from the old timers stashing the cards
But jail aint part of the plans
I keep weight on the scale cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash em up the boy mighta went platinum but dont gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut
I dont deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes I dont make mistakes
Double R now bitch you oughta know Im a ghost
Blow up your face blow up the coke and blow up the smoke

6769,"Straight Outta Compton Clean Lyrics
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton its a crazy brotha named Ice Cube
From the stupiddope gang wit a attitude
When Im called off I gotta sawedoff
Kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you get with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off yo back thats how Im going out
For the sucka dumb brothas thats showing out
Some start to mumble they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Going off on everybody like that
With bass thats droppin in your face
So give it up smooth
Aint no telling when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep you dancing
With a crime record like Charles Manson
Yo Dre whats the sound of my tool
Now you know that Im about to act a fool
Me you can go toe to toe no maybe
Im knocking suckas out the box daily
Yo weekly monthly and yearly
Until the whole damn world see clearly
That Im down with the capital CPT
Boy you cant step to me
So when Im in your neighborhood you better duck down
Cause Ice Cube will damn sure buck em down
As I leave believe Im stomping
But when I come back boy Im coming straight outta Compton
Yo Ren
Whassup
Tell em where you from
Straight outta Compton a brotha with his finger on the trigger
More punks I take out my rep gets bigger
Im a ruthless villain and you know this
But the suckas in the public wont show this
But I dont really care Imma make my snaps
If not from the records from jacking the craps
Its like burglary the definition is jacking
And when illegally armed its called packing
Knock a fool out in a sec
I find somebody talkin trash and put em in check
So if youre at a show in the front row
Imma call you a sucka if you dont go with the flow
Youll probably get mad like a punk is supposed to
But that shows me yo youre composed to
A crazy young brotha from the street
Attitude legit cause Im ready to hit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any fool in my way that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and thats a law
REN spells Ren but Im raw
See cause people know me as a villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killing
Thats taking place without a clue
And once youre on the scope you know youre through
Look you might take it as a trip
But a brotha like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother thatll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous young brotha raising hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont really care thats the problem
When I see a police I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see the punk pass I smile
To me its kinda funny the attitude showing suckas driving
But dont know where the hell they going just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless
Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see Ill get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and now Im jetting
And leave a memory no onell be forgetting
So what about the girl who got shot 
You think I give a damn about a girl I aint a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E
And if you ever mess with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the mother yeah
Straight outta Compton
Thats the way it goes in the city of Compton boy

5033,"Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Ive been thinking bout Ive been thinking bout
Ive been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love feel I need another dose
I know its a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice where did the king go wrong
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls I need your warm
The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so Im a keep dreaming on
Its kind of like The Breakup with Jen and Vince Vaughn
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
They say you dont know know know what you got
Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such yo a lot but the feelings not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasnt able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess its only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Cause I want you cause I want you

",words to say to the sky Some days I would try but wasnt able to cry I never been good at saying goodbye I take a deep breath when the times is hard When I reminisce over you my God I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob I guess its only right that I got my heart robbed The scent of a room that reminds me of you A hint of perfume it reminds me of you Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you Hope the stars and the gods align me and you Once the love was strong Now its long long gone Cause the pain came down like a storm I remained holding on Cause I want you cause I want you I want you I want you We do what we do and we do what we live I love this way cause I got it as a kid With so much to give from it I never hid The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared My friends say it was a change for the better But I say girl you changed my forever Relationships they can be as strange as the weather Rain or sun we can sing this together Cause I want you cause I want you I want you I want you Cause I want you cause I want you I want you I want you The Chicago Kansas concert in Boston has been changed to the Kansas Boston concert in Chicago,Once the love was strong Now its long long gone Cause the pain came down like a storm I remained holding on Cause I want you cause I want you I want you I want you Ive been thinking bout Ive been thinking bout Ive been thinking bout you lately Thoughts take me to when we were close Addicted to your love feel I need another dose I know its a feeling that should be long gone Things seem to come up when I hear our song Golden brown girl it seemed so long Since I heard your voice where did the king go wrong Emotions that that they linger on I guess cause I never knew a love so strong So many hot girls I need your warm The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm Good food and love I need your warm This here was made before we were born A dreamer so Im a keep dreaming on Its kind of like The Breakup with Jen and Vince Vaughn Once the love was strong Now its long long gone Cause the pain came down like a storm I remained holding on Cause I want you cause I want you I want you I want you They say you dont know know know what you got Til what you got is gone Yeah I like such and such yo a lot but the feelings not as strong We were like 2 birds that were able to fly I try to pick the right

Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time
So gold
Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever
And be in time
Stay gold
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
Oh gold

To the death of us me and my confidants we shine
You feel the ambiance yall niggas just rhyme
By the ounce dough accumulates like snow
We dont just shine we illuminate the whole show you feel me
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street let alone the heat
Fuck em they hate a nigga lovin his life
In all possible ways know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
On the uptown hot block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin this is a minor setback
Yo still in all we livin just dream about the getback
That made him smile though his eyes said pray for me
Ill do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest its a slow process
And I aint got nothin but time
I had near brushes not to mention
Three shots close range never touched me divine intervention

In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin brilliant
Ill tell you half the story the rest you fill it in
Long as the villain win

6602,"I shoulda used a rubber before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass wont be sittin in a clinic
Ayyo one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came but one problem she brought a friend
You know Im not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean cause you know I wouldnt fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes tryin to get the puss
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said I hope you aint tryin to dick tease
Ayyo cause Big Ls quick to tell a bitch leave
Ayyo my game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab on 139 Lenox
Ayyo I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo Imma kill that bitch the next time that I see her
x2
I shoulda used a rubber before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass wont be sittin in a clinic
One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad pointblank she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said Sweeheart whats your name
I got a man I aint ask you that
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You wont be able to switch I said Fuck you bitch
Another girl walked by I called her
Excuse me whats your name Lorraine whats yours

I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said Ls for Lamont but whats the Big for Youll see
Ayyo my pockets was extra thick
So what you doin later oh nothing then lets catch a flick
Yeah I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M movies meal and motel
And when it comes to this Im a professor
I didnt molest her I caressed her undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting bolder
Cause I didnt put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a leak
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick

And to think that you are mine you are mine alone

Slow it down speed it up Im just being me

Bond that we share so unbreakable
Heres a toast to the baddest chick in the room

Ahh Real Compton City Gs

Ahh Real Compton City Gs
Ahh Real Compton City Gs
Hey Yo doctor heres another proper track
And its phat watch the sniper time to pay the piper
And let that real stuff provoke so yous a wannabe loc
And youll get smoked and I hope that the fans understand
When ya talk about playin me
The same records that you making is paying me
Dre
Snoop
Death Row
Yo and here comes me left blow
Cause Im the EAZYE and this is the season
To let the Real Compton City Gs in
Your like a kid you found it bumping down the dapper
But tell me where the hell you found that anorexic rapper
Talking about who you gon squabble with and who you shoot
Youre only 60 pounds when your wet and wearing boots
Damn E they tried to fade you on Dre Day 
But Dre Day only met Eazys pay day
All of a sudden Dr Dre is a G thang
But on his old album cover he was a she thing
So sucker please sucker please dont step to these Real Compton City Gs
Stomp him in his track
Show him that Im ruthless
Every day it a new rapper claiming to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a girl but portray the role of gangsta
Aint broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap about the guns and knives
Just take a good look at the brother and youll capture the fact that the bastard is
Simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the Mental
Of homies in Compton Wattz and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse you claim to do the dirt
But tell me whos a witness to your fucking work
See you never had no business so save the drama jerk
Brothers straight kill me knowing that they pranksters
This is going out to you studio gangsters
See I did dirt put in work and many brothers can vouch that
So since I got stripes I got the right to rap about that
But brothers like you I gotta hate you
Im just tired of suburbian brothers talking about they come from projects
Knowing you aint seen no parts of the streets G
I think you start trying to bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin khakis and mob while you rhyme little 
Tried to sag but you fronting at the same time
And your set dont accept you
Scared to kick it witcha homies cause ya know they dont respect you
So brother please brother please dont step to these Real Compton City Gs
Well its the Knock Out definition original baby gangster
Approach me like you hard little buster
Im bank ya
Shank ya with my damn shank if i have ta
Dr Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are really actors
Pranksters studio gangsters busters
But this time your dealing with some real last brothers
Gs fool please dont try to step
See if you do then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See young brothers like me will break ya off somthing
Claiming my city but Dre you aint from Compton
Niggas like Dogg is what I call wanna bes and aint nothing compared to Real Compton City Gs
Stomp him in his track and
Show him that Im ruthless
I never met an OG who never did nothing wrong
You tried to dis the EazyE so now sucker its on you
And your Doggy Dogg think that yall hogging it
Both of you tricks can come and suck my doggy 
Beating up a woman dont make you it
But then again some brothers think it makes a man
Damn its a trip how Dre can switch so quick
From wearing lipstick to smoking on at picnics
And now you think your bigger
But to me you aint nothing but trick ass buster
That aint worth a food stamp
And at Death Row I hear your getting treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeants directions
Or get yo ass popped with a Smith and Wesson
Learn a lesson from the E
Stay in your place and dont step to Real Compton City Gs
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre Whats up bang
Boy ya should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre whats up Bang
Boy ya should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless
Yo Dre whats up bang
Boy you should have known by now
Stop him in his tracks show him that I am Ruthless

4895,"Most of us came from a broken home
Drownin in my sorrow drinkin liquor tryin to smoke alone
Argue with my wife so I broke my phone
Threw it on the wall tryin to ball but they playing zone
Connect is acting funny with the work
Like my money didnt work they gon end up getting merked
The label acting funny with the deal
Like the shit that I be spittin on the record wasnt real
Hood mad but they know a nigga ride
But the anger and jealousy can blow a nigga high
The other day I said I know a nigga fucked
When I played the bodega it was two dollars for the Dutch
To keep it real we living in real time
And I feel a niggas pain but they never can feel mine
And so Im on the go with the green light
I dont even sleep how the fuck could I dream right

Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh but Imma do me you can say whatever

Ghost never on that swag shit
Guess its a sad thing my tarot card is magic
I remember I aint never have shit
December was cold but February was drastic
So pardon my niggas and what they traffic
Or if they seem cold when the murder scenes tragic
Niggas can talk shit we dont even glimpse
Niggas can get hit we dont even wince
Come with an entourage and I dont mean Vince
Purple ape in a purple Porsche of course Im playing Prince
Or looking through the sky light my light
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights
Blowin on a long Dutch inhale
How I lie Id rather die than be in jail
Its all good til its all bad
And the ugly niggas gon crash your broads pad
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyyyeahhhyeahh but Imma do me you can say whatever
Im a G
I keep it moving in my new JOs
On them blocks where them young boys move llello
They salute like Whattup OG I salute
Cause its the Wild Wild West like Kool Moe Dee
What they do for a twodoor B and a nice watch
Blow your brains out when the cocaine price drop
Like yeah I know my man got life ock
The game dont stop so pull the weed out your nike sock
Yeah Its like that aint it
My down South niggas that got the Lex painted
My East coast niggas that got the Benz kitted
Dont it hurt when they snitch and you found out your friends did it
I thought its money over bitches but
Niggas throw money at bitches so lets kick it
If you really live by the G code
Shoot a couple of guns hurry up and reload

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world
Uh let me drop it on the one its the fat mack
Dope like an 8Ball thats why people call me that
Some used to call me Mr Big but I had to flip
Now they call me Mr Ruffle cause Im all about my chips
Matter fact you need a jackhammer just to dig me
Orange juice and DT keep a playa tipsy
It only seems like yesterday thinking back
I had to work a job and hustle just to keep a sack
Stuck in Orange Mound ten toes down
Nowhere to go but up Im underground Im so down
But God bless me with this gift of poetry
So with this CD the world could see what I see
Came hard for them bustas on the outside looking in
Made mad ends with some paper and a pen than
Did it again for all of yall
MJG and 8Ball sitting on top of the world

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world
Keep that animosity that you got against me off your chest
Cause you cant bring me down even if you tried your best
I guess is what I gotsta do
Separate myself from them bustas hang tight with my own crew
Some people hate to see me make it
And any opportunity they get where they can hurt me they gon take it
I hate it but too late it gets rougher
My chrome plated thang blew your cover in the gutter
Of the brothers who dont know me well claim that they do
And persistence turn a lie into the truth aint no use
First of all I believe in God
Im coming out hard
And I can finish anything you can start
Cross your heart
As I keep a tight grip on my tone
Cause when I aint at home its gonna let me know that I aint alone
Im gone mentally speaking

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world
Ive seen so much from coast to coast and state to state
Bird slanging ballas and the fakest of the fake
Getting paid getting played getting sprayed in the streets
While me and MJG getting paid freaking beats
Were versatile south style rap ability
I had to catch a plane that took me far from my community
Made a lot of cheese people say I changed
But if you thinking this you never knew me from the gate mane
Much respect to young Gs on the streets banging
And all my niggas who survive day to day swanging
And Ill keep serving all my dope vocally
Cause its survival of the fittest mentally
Ive seen a lot of luxuries fine cars movie stars social bars
Many women fake friends in my face nine ten
Even though I stack dont stand down on my income
I never would forget about the streets that I come from
The drugs the violence not one day of silence
The robbing the shooting mothas prostitutin
The Mound is my home the hood im around
But if you jack me your whole family going down
Your motha your daddy your aunty your cousins
They all going out by the whole dirty dozen
M JG music in the streets scholar
On top of the world tryin to make a dollar

Running through the pissy stairwells I aint hear nothin
Buggin only thing I remember was the bullshit summons
So I stopped at the second floor ran across
Cracks is fallin my pockets is mean clean when I vanished off
Took off made track look easy

Run I will not give up no quick flag the car down Yo yo yo 
Take me to Ghost here they come now

Hit the bitch dog turn down Hill light the Marley spliff
Run I will not get bagged on a rock
Run I seen what happened to Un they bad with they cops
Run they amp shit plant shit destroy evidence
Fuck a case Im not coming home when im fiftysix No 
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me in shit
Bounce if you a good kid bounce do the bird hop
Curve swerve and get served these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killing shit they must got word
That I told the chief of Rich Port I dont wanna merge

Run if you getting chased with no shoes on
Run fuck that run cops got guns

Clear twelvetwelves that look like stuffed shells
Im cutting niggas throats on the sales while they puff Ls
Dont leave nothing unbagged shave everything
I learned from the OGs to save everything
They come by one more time they gon hop out
They two deep and one is a bitch she getting knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing so Im dippin with that uh
Downshifting on em like I got gears on me
Besides that I got about five years on me Run 
Scared to death running like I got bears on me Run 
My Timbs start feeling like they Nike Airs on me Run 
Its hard for me to slow down its like Im on the Thruway
My belts in the crib on the floor by my twoway
Now Im trying to hold my hammer up and my pants too
If they dont kill me they gon give me a number I cant do
Rather it be the streets than jail where I die at
And Im asthmatic so Im looking for somewhere to hide at
But they too close and I got this new toast
Imagine if I wouldve let off a shot or two you know what I gotta do
Run if you sell drugs in the school zone
Run if you getting chased with no shoes on

8014,"Ahhhh yeaaaaaaaaah
Eightball MJG in the muthafuckin house
And we came here today to talk to you about this thing called pimpin
It has been misunderstood over the years
So now we have come to set the record straight
Niggas dont do this shit right
It takes a special kind of nigga
You know what Im sayin
Yeah
It takes a nigga thats hard from the start you gotta have heart
To meet a bitch mack her down then rip her apart
Its all in the game a nigga cant change
If you dont break a bitch then your game is lame mayne
See Im from Tennessee with curls and gold teeth
So everywhere I go bitches strike up conversations wit me
About the way I talk about the way I dress
About how my gold teeth look so fresh
See how I bait em in soon as a nigga speak
That deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
Im in my Cadillac chillin like a fat mack
Smoking on a fat sack drinkin on a pint of gnac
I pick up my car phone cause the freak beeped
Its my nigga baby mama but sometimes I creep
Thats just the way it is niggas have to take a chance
When you aint around anybody could be in that ass
But Im just a young nigga tryna make a dollar
And they way I live to some its hard to swallow
See livin down south aint what you think it be
Nine times out of ten niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah thats right
We trying to teach all these lames you know
How to do this shit
Cause its really a hard job
But them lame niggas
They make me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Now let me explain a pimp a nigga about the MONEY
See a ho break a ho
And try to influence the bitch to turn a trick for the nigga who
Persuaded her to sell ass like hoes supposed to
Now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
Surrounded by all these hoes thats goin and givin me money
Its funny how a ho can make you think she wit ya
When all the time shes just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
Take care of your business bring me the money
Yeah this shit is thick
Ho dont violate bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash grab on his ass write that trick a love letter
Train your woman to break a manman meaning another nigga
Just some shit in the game same ol same to make your pimpin thicker
Slicker the pimpin gets freakier gets the bitch
MJG is rich Im coocoo for these tricks
I pimp
Yeah thats right baby I pimp
So uh what you need to do you need to sit dat ass there
And uh right about now Im bout to fire up one of these spliffs
And get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah shit so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Part 2 its all the same G
Trying to school fools on this PIMP
Lesson one First you should pull a bitch fuck her good
Next time tell her no the next time take her dough
Oh you better watch your back too mayne
Cause theres a lot of bitches in the world wit much game
Lesson two Watch that ho dont trust her wit none of yo dough
Never let a bitch know how you make your cash flow
Lesson three If you dont tell that ho who is boss
Bitches like to run shit but end up getting smacked in the mouth
See a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
Push her head into the wall til you hear that crackin sound
Drown in the tub rubadubdub
Some niggas get pussywhupped and fall into a love bugs
Buying hoes this buying hoes that
Then bragging to your friends how you fucked her from back
Never how you took they cash never how you beat they ass
Never how you pull hoes fuck em then drop em fast
I dont understand your plan at all man
But you should be around niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah man these niggas a trip you know what Im sayin
But niggas like me I have to smoke them spliffs
To get my mind off that shit
And when I smoke em I get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
You know I stay high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Wherever there is a ho theres bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can tempt
A sucker will spend his money til he aint got nothin left
Instead of blaming the bitch he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldnt be a ho if it wasnt for the tricks
But I suggest we keep em so a pimp can keep his bitch
It need to be understood there wouldnt be one without the other
So why in the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
Jealous sucker just maaaaad
They cant hang with the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimps game
How in the fuck do you figure that pimpin is dead when nigga you know its alive
Pimpin is misunderstood by those who cant thats why they said it died
Others tried pimpin but was only makin chump change
One track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
Rearrange shit that they done seen in a movie script
Damn aint that a bitch niggas like me
Pimp
MJfuckinG PIMP
Staying down on this pimpin bout these hoes
But some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
And that shit just makes me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah yeah I get so fuckin high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground

He alone decides who writes a symphony
He lights every star that makes the darkness bright
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night
He still finds the time to hear a childs first prayer
Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live
Hell always say I forgive
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold
He knows every lie that you and I have told

Nigga Aladdin SLJs in the motherfuckin place
Behind the mixin boards
We about to do dis shit like this here
Verse 1
Its goin down tonight in LA
Buckshot and uzis spray
Microphone blowa
The bitch checka the ho wrecka
Ice motherfuckin T nigga step to me
But grab ya hoes quick
Cause the Syndicates throwin that crazy dick
Punk motherfuckers run up
Youll get done up
Well have your ass gunned up
Before sunup
So whats the color Im raggin
Been a millionare for years
Still saggin
Left pockets stuffed with a huge ass brick
380 in my right so it sags a little bit
More than the rest of my gear
When Im on tour
I empty clips bust lips and I break jaws
Cause I love to loc up
So punk motherfucker dont choke up
When youre talkin to me
Chorus
Ice Ice motherfuckin T x4 
Verse 2
Bush Quayle and Clinton got a problem with me
The motheruckin T
I give less than a fuck about any of them
Or their fuckin police friends
Theyd like to take me out
Make me a goner
They even tryin to sweat Time Warner
Why
For tellin the truth to the youth
That a lot of motherfuckers are hot
And want police shot
You cant stop the shock  
The fires are out
But the coals are still hot
I got juice to bring pain
You tryin to fuck with the Ice
Are you insane
This shit is bigger than me
Be warned
Its the lull before the storm
And every fuckin thing I write
Is gonna be analyzed by somebody white
Chorus
Verse 3
Run motherfucker hide motherfucker trip motherfucker die motherfucker
You dont give love and you wont get loved
You dont push and you wont get shoved
No joke I aint here to laugh I aint here to cry
But every night of the wee kone of my homies die
Eeny meeny mynie moe
Bloods pourin out the naps of your afro
It could be you could be you could be you
Could be your whole damn crew
It happens real quick
Screechin tires next thing youre hit
Your bodys cold your bodys hot
You feel your chest you gasp for breath youre shot
And now your homies is trippin
Lookin for a gat to put they clip in
Street crime
Thats the thing I bring Ice T
IceT I rap BC I sing
They call it controversy
I call it truth with no mercy
The beats are phat Ammo Dump tracks
The kind that make speakers crack
Not made for squares or the weak punks
That made to bump trunks
Press get the fuck out my fuckin face
I aint got no more time to waste
A ho is a ho a bitch is a bitch a nigga is a nigga and thats it
Im through explainin the shit
You just makin me backtrack
The next duck reporter might get hit with a blackjack
Plus every one of my true fans
Totally understands a nigga like me

4400,"When in Love 3X 
When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
Itll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard Ive done some effed up things
From kicking them in the Nerfs to throwin away his ring
So if you love me love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
Im not embarassed nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past Ive been gamed
But that was then and this is now
And theres no way damn it theres no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of
When in Love
When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say I must have been deranged
Im talkin like pickin your lovers nose
Cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car
You could be partyin and havin a ball
But you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
Waitin for the phone to ring that aint right
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin youd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of
When in Love 2X 
When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
Like twoseater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens she got you strung
Guess it doesnt matter long as youre having fun
Lovell make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said Love makes things happen
Its most important to hear what Im rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of
When in Love 6X

You know what makes me unhappy Whats that 
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy Oh yeah yeah yeah 
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman Yeah yeah 
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
Why Why Why Why Why Why 
I think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we dont well have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies Oh yeahyeah 
And since a man cant make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know youre fed up ladies but keep ya head up

Ayo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right Oh yeahyeah 
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for the pen
I try to find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity Oh no no no 
It seems the rainll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up huh
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Said it aint no hope for the youth
And the truth is it aint no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy huh
I blame my mother for turnin my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its a setup
And even though youre fed up huh you got to keep ya head up
Keep ya head up 
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keepkeep ya head up 
Ooh child thingsll get brighter
Ohoh keep ya head up 
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keepkeep ya head up 
Ooh child thingsll get brighter
And uh to all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it in fact Im sure
And if you fall stand tall and come back for more Ohoh 
Cause aint nothin worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man feelin helpless I know you were 
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dyin inside but outside youre lookin fearless
While the tears is rollin down your cheeks
Youre steady hopin things dont all fall this week Yeah 
Cause if it did you couldnt take it Yeah 
And dont blame me I was given this world I didnt make it Oh yeah 
And now my sons gettin older and older
And cold from havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to survivin friends Oh yeah

6698,"Like anybody I would like to live a long life longevity has its place
But Im not concerned about that now
I just want to do Gods will
And Hes allowed me to go up to the mountain
And Ive looked over
And Ive seen the Promised Land
I may not get there with you
But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land
So Im happy tonight
Im not worried about anything Im not fearing any man
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at it always follows you where you are
And its hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But its harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically runnin from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South I respect they vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of Americas vision
They want us dancin coonin and hollerin
Only respect us for playin sports and modelin
More than racism its stay in your placeism
More people are trapped in practical blackfaceism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
Its between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Crip niggas Blood niggas eses Asians
Why the fuck we warrin with each others population
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation why the separation
Why we got Jamaicans hatin on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other straight hatin
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness inwhat Im sayin
You gotta recognize another G aint the enemy
When the police ride and kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets we should really end war
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Our hearts were torn apart just like yall was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Every time we called your office you ignored us
Now you holdin hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us ask if were jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of selfdefense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom justice security
But theyre only pure when theyre applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Urgently puttin fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qurans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me my wife and babies we aint never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesnt come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you Civil war

Know the meanin of VAPORS
The meanin of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be there when youre down and out
Once youre established and got a lot of money
Everybody wanna be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
Can you feel it nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time what Im gonna do
Is tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew
Well you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records
Make the Music Nobody Beats the Biz well check it
Back in the days before this began
He used to try to talk to this girl name Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair
When Swan tried to kick it she always fessed
Talking about Nigga please you work for UPS
Since he wasnt no type of big drug dealer
My man TJ Swan didnt appeal to her
But now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots
Rough leather fashion and tough silk suits
Now she stop fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming to all the shows every single weekend
To get his beeper number shed be begging please
Dying for the day to get skeezed
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
I got another partner thats calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow thats laid back
Back in the days he was nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
What grownups would tell him he would never obey
He wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied
And a rastatype Kangol tilted to the side
Around his neighborhood people treated him bad
And said he was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum
Or either in jail or someone would shoot him
But now hes grown up to their surprise
Big Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didnt like him as a child
Be saying can I borrow a dollar ooh youre a star now
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
Now I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee
Better known to yall as Cutmaster Cool V
He cuts scratch transform with finesse
imitates cuts and scratches and all that mess
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get this job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Said Sorry Mr Lee but theres no help wanted
Now my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on
Til the like break of dawn
To put this JOB in effect
But theyd look right past him and be like Next
Now for the year of 88
Cool V is making dollars so my cousins like straight
He walks into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like Vaughan welcome to my store
Offering him a job but naw he dont want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasnt
Now guess what they caught from my cousin
The vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
When I was a teenager I wanted to be down
With a lot of MCDJing crews in town
So in school on Nobel Street I say Can I be down champ
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected I was very depressed
Sat and wrote some def doodoo rhymes at my rest
When I used to come to parties theyd make me pay
I would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day
I was never into girls I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it
But now things switched without belief
Yo Biz do you remember me from Noble Street chief
We used to be down back in the days
It happens all the time and never cease to amaze

5528,"Ready willin and able
Here comes the new modern day Dark Gable
On the mattress and on the box springs
Girls they wanna sport me like bamboo earrings
The gogetter the skinshitter
And if your girl says she met me I probably did her
Word up the sex super stud
I jump your bones like ten Crips against one Blood
Nasty The NASTY
Ready for action if you wanna see why
So come on and lets do this
As I tiptoe through your tulips
Like Moses I part them legs like the Red Sea
And then I plant somethin deadly
Poundin and poundin is how Im servin this
Makin it look like your bed is goin through turbulence
Lots of lust between the two of us
The sign on my Jimmy says Kidneys or bust so
I shove deeper than the voice of Barry
To make you hit high notes like Mariah Carey
Its like a Morris Day jerkout
To put you in more positions than a Jane Fonda workout
Im ready to tear down walls
You say lets chill but to hell with that
Im not Aaron Hall so
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it in 
I paid the cost to be the boss
Like with that HIV rumor they tried to toss
But Im so good with the women that if I ever caught AIDS
A woman doctord find a cure just so she could get laid
So never fear my dear just come on over here
I practice safe sex with girls I lay next
In other words the Jhats on the head
Cause Im too sexy for AIDS like Right Said Fred
So can I touch you there huh Huh
I like to take my time whenever Im
Massagin my fingers through a girl oohwee
I leave her wet just like her beaver had a Jheri curl
Then I begin to hit those skins
So baby doll let let me in
And if youre the slight bit tight from virginity
vaseline on me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it in 
Just another pervert that loves to flirt
With a skirt so at a concert girls stay alert
Cause I be hoppin on em just like a frog
I run through a Luke video like its a smorgasbord
I start sweatin my back gets to humpin
Then I thump and I thump and I thump and I thump
I dont carry a gun but Im packin somethin lethal
One of the last sheBOINKIN people
So come on Miss Thing dont front
You got me on a hunt and you know what I want that
USSY wait thats not the way oh
Pass the Peas like they used to say
And when I give you this fat one
You gotta guard your grill honey
Nonononononono not that one
Because I give girls the grand slam
Im like a radio station continuous jams
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me
Give it to me give it to me

Grease dont pop on the stove no more
Moved on up
Double shot Hennessey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out WHAT THE FUCK 
Act like my rims aint clean
How you gonna act like my neck dont bling
Haters get sprayed like AfroSheen
But they dont ever really wanna pop them thangs
Cane cane sugar man Luda dont go
And I stop at a light pulled up so slow
But Im out for the night so pass that dro
So daddy come home in a Cadillac brome Cadillac brome 
Now dont it sound absurd
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms then bend them curves
Chop chop chunk it up fat man herb

Act like I dont make clouds
How you gonna act like I dont get loud
How you gonna act like I dont rock crowds
And leave a lot of people with a gaptooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you dont really know dont hurt
With a vest and a pump hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block man they got that work They got that work 
Dont it smell so good
In Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest they up to no good

7247,"Danger Beat Bandits nigga
Yeah Harlem to Chicago to LA to Toronto
Philly motherfuckin Rio De Janeiro nigga
Cape Town South Africa
I never make songs to disrespect women
Or to judge people about the way that they livin
But the way I am is based on the life I was given
Like them white boys losin my religion
I used to be a Christian and a political pawn
The Bible is right and all your native culture is wrong
Next thing you know you tellin me bout makin a song
Come in the studio and tell me that Im makin it wrong
Pissed off cause reality is makin us strong
Like the ghost of Timothy McVeigh makin a bomb
Ayo Marvin Gaye what the fuck is goin on
These rap niggas made propaganda out of your song
But its the Gong Show amateur night at the Apollo
My dick is like my music but harder to swallow
So children follow me like the Pied Piper
And sing the chorus in the air with your blunt and your lighter
Sing that shit nigga right now
You played yourself thinkin you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
You played yourself thinkin that you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
Yeah yeah
The second verse is worse than the first in this respect
Scripted specifically to keep people in check
Harlem to Boston real niggas spit with me
But Landspeed you aint fuckin shit to me
And underground labels know that I dont trust you
You only independent til you major so fuck you
And if youre pissed off cause you think that I dissed you
Ill rape your moms and we can make this a personal issue
Dance with the Devil remember that youre not on my level
Stupid youre not ready
I won Disypher Bragging Rights from Rocksteady
And practically every battle that they got in New York
And Ill still murder rappers on the street for sport
Doctor Guillotine cuttin you short little man
But you dont give me props cause I never won at Scribble Jam
Well fuck you I hope someone you love dies
So fuck your crew And fuck your family too
Technique said it bitch what the fuck you gon do
You played yourself thinkin you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
You played yourself thinkin that you down with me
I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see
The way you get shot for crossin the boundary
Yeah wrap it up on these niggas man
Wrap it up yeah
Immortal Technique incinerate degenerate fags
Burn Trent Lott wrapped in his Confederate flag
I got the Beretta with my face wrapped in a rag
So put the African slave jewelry in the bag
Motherfuckers tell me that a diamond is forever
But is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Medgar Evers
House niggas get your head severed tryna be thug
You dont concern me Im tryin to hurt the people you love
Word of mouth is Im in the club bein sneaky
Im like the body snatchers and your girl is gettin sleepy
I murder you indiscreetly right at the source
Like the Roman legionnaire that stabbed Christ on the cross
This is about you though it aint about Jesus
And you shouldnt fuckin talk about telekenesis
Nigga please movin shit with your mind
Try movin your moms out the projects with your rhymes
And next time Im comin after cualquiera
Profanity fuckin carajo maldita mierda
Roll up the hierba y pasala para la izquierda
Put the price up to listen to me pop shit
Cause I got Martha Stewart givin me stock tips
Underground money with honeys up in the whip
Bangbuscom nigga fuckin your bitch
Yeah played yourself nigga fuck all yall
You dont know shit about me
Why open your mouth and discuss who the fuck I am
I thought I told yall niggas on Volume 1
I wasnt fuckin around you just slept
Cause you sold a few thousand units in the golden era
When niggas would buy anything on the shelf
Those days are through and you are through with them
",me props cause I never won at Scribble Jam Well fuck you I hope someone you love dies So fuck your crew And fuck your family too Technique said it bitch what the fuck you gon do You played yourself thinkin you down with me I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see The way you get shot for crossin the boundary You played yourself thinkin that you down with me I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see The way you get shot for crossin the boundary Yeah wrap it up on these niggas man Wrap it up yeah Immortal Technique incinerate degenerate fags Burn Trent Lott wrapped in his Confederate flag I got the Beretta with my face wrapped in a rag So put the African slave jewelry in the bag Motherfuckers tell me that a diamond is forever But is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Medgar Evers House niggas get your head severed tryna be thug You dont concern me Im tryin to hurt the people you love Word of mouth is Im in the club bein sneaky Im like the body snatchers and your girl is gettin sleepy I murder you indiscreetly right at the source Like the Roman legionnaire that stabbed Christ on the cross This is about you though it aint about Jesus And you shouldnt fuckin talk about telekenesis Nigga please movin shit with your mind Try movin your moms out the projects with your rhymes And next time Im comin after cualquiera Profanity fuckin carajo maldita mierda Roll up the hierba y pasala para la izquierda Put the price up to listen to me pop shit Cause I got Martha Stewart givin me stock tips Underground money with honeys up in the whip Bangbuscom nigga fuckin your bitch Yeah played yourself nigga fuck all yall You dont know shit about me Why open your mouth and discuss who the fuck I am I thought I told yall niggas on Volume 1 I wasnt fuckin around you just slept Cause you sold a few thousand units in the golden era When niggas would buy anything on the shelf Those days are through and you are through with them,Danger Beat Bandits nigga Yeah Harlem to Chicago to LA to Toronto Philly motherfuckin Rio De Janeiro nigga Cape Town South Africa I never make songs to disrespect women Or to judge people about the way that they livin But the way I am is based on the life I was given Like them white boys losin my religion I used to be a Christian and a political pawn The Bible is right and all your native culture is wrong Next thing you know you tellin me bout makin a song Come in the studio and tell me that Im makin it wrong Pissed off cause reality is makin us strong Like the ghost of Timothy McVeigh makin a bomb Ayo Marvin Gaye what the fuck is goin on These rap niggas made propaganda out of your song But its the Gong Show amateur night at the Apollo My dick is like my music but harder to swallow So children follow me like the Pied Piper And sing the chorus in the air with your blunt and your lighter Sing that shit nigga right now You played yourself thinkin you down with me I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see The way you get shot for crossin the boundary You played yourself thinkin that you down with me I end your life nigga dont fuck around with me And if you kids cant listen then you bound to see The way you get shot for crossin the boundary Yeah yeah The second verse is worse than the first in this respect Scripted specifically to keep people in check Harlem to Boston real niggas spit with me But Landspeed you aint fuckin shit to me And underground labels know that I dont trust you You only independent til you major so fuck you And if youre pissed off cause you think that I dissed you Ill rape your moms and we can make this a personal issue Dance with the Devil remember that youre not on my level Stupid youre not ready I won Disypher Bragging Rights from Rocksteady And practically every battle that they got in New York And Ill still murder rappers on the street for sport Doctor Guillotine cuttin you short little man But you dont give

The air is so cold here

One weve never reached

We could fade away

In a town much like a prison cell
People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories theyd tell

People dont bother saying Hello
Unless somebodys born or dies
And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But its much too late when the fear is gone
I will meet you in the next life I promise you 
Where we can be together I promise you 
I will wait til then in Heaven I promise you

Theres so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates

Their intentions arent that good
And I can smell the asphalt

Please be considerate and leave a nice message after the tone One
Styles I just wanted to speak to him I got too much words
I got a lot of words lets see yo yo
Life is a circle of pain
The darkest clouds end up like the purplest rain
They say patience is a virtue in the game
Fuck it I guess I died when my brother died
Cause to tell you the truth I feel like Im the curse in the game
My vision is blurred dreams is shattered my heart is broke
Pain so deep I find it hard to cope
Missin your smile and missin your style
I figured Im the next one dead so we could kick it a while
Cause your name lives on the sun still shine
Every time your baby mom lift up your child
I guess I gotta switch my angle now
Take a positive look hit a blunt my little brothers with the angels now
Some of us fall and some of us fly
But at the end of the book baby all of us die
Word my nigga
Theres my brother
I could smile cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophets and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin the sky
Theres my brother
I could cry for the fact I cant hug him no more
But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me
And the good thing is he aint got to worry no more
I said theres my brother with Allah
Best place he could be
If I could get my miracle on
Listen to me I would bring my brother back in the physical form
Cause the spirit still here but the visual gone
And sometimes I gotta think if Imma live to the morn
I guess its no more schooling you
I know its something in our blood that kept us niggas in the street as usual
Left with a robbery charge pack and a stash
Crushed a lot of niggas thatd happened to gav
But Imma just light a blunt look in the clouds
And Imma ask my little nigga whats happening Hav
You died on Mothers Day mom its a gift
I know God took my brother cause his honor and strength
And we all gonna die Allah tally us up
While you there say whats up to Lil Malla and Duck
And I know yall niggas restin in peace
You might be gone but your soul is still here and is blessin the streets
Theres my brother My niggas 
I could smile cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophet and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin the sky

I could see you when Im all alone I see you 
So I guess Im not all alone I know my little nigga callin home
The good die young so they could get to heaven early
And watch over the rest of the slums watch over us please 
Move the clouds so we could see the rest of the sun
You mightve died but you in heaven thats a blessing in one
Nigga robbin to the death Gary died with a close friend
You and Allen together smiling together

Savin his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said Sonny move out to the country
Ah but workin too hard can give you a heart attack
Ackackackackack
You oughta know by now
You oughta know by now 
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money
And it seems such a waste of time
If thats what its all about
Mama if thats movin up then Im
Movin out
Im movin out mmm mm
Oohooh uhhuh mmm
Sergeant OLeary is walkin the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr Cacciatores
Down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah and hes tradin in his Chevy
For a Cadillacacacacacac
You oughta know by now
You oughta know by now 
And if he cant drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

Catch me dont you
Catch me dont you
Catch me Ive fallen in love for the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit on this bus I sit
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Thinking bout you thinking bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin me wantin me givin me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin me
Handcuffs keep huggin the wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they cant afford
Even with the discount write a check that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit it dont matter the amount
We just swipin shit here we dont love we just likin shit here
Whats that smell Wheres your diaper shit here
Lay on your back dont pee right now
Or else Ill have to get you back
One day when you gon want to get your way
Yeah Ill have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I aint never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking
Am I worthy of this gift
Am I strong enough to lift Am I strong enough to lift 
Into a place that I can see Into a place that I can see 
Someone more important than me Someone more important than me 
Am I worthy of this gift Am I worthy of this gift 
Am I strong enough to lift Am I strong enough to lift 
Into a place that I can see Into a place that I can see 
Someone more important than me Someone more important than me 
Ib gon ask me how I did this shit
Im gon do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit hey mama look what God made
Shes mine Catch me dont you
Shes mine Catch me dont you
Shes mine Catch me
Ive fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry and I aint even tryna fight it
Dont wanna die cause now youre here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin baby
I dry your eyes I dry your eyes
There is a God it is a God
Yeah it is a God

I said the good Lord made me what I am and I play this game for keeps
Got to use what I have to get what I want all the dreamer got is his dream
And the good Lord made me what I am and I play the hand Im dealt
Said sometimes the hardest thing to be in this world is just yourself
Best believe the Quran influenced all of my songs
My fans run and tattoo em all on they arms
Wanna travel be there every time I perform
Now look me in my eye and tell me how am I wrong
And who would of thought
Just givin em the truth from my heart both the ugly and the beautiful part
Would give em food from thought let em chew it apart
And theyd all crowd around me and my movement would start
And how you gonna hate me for being what God made me
Its not a game I aint sayin it playfully
They relate to the joy and the pain in me
And seein me make it be watchin a slave get free
Holler like Bilal in the tower
Hayya alal falah Allah is the power
Givin voice to the dream and let it be seen
I admit its obscene but deen recognize deen
So it isnt pristine when I spit a sixteen
Clean words dont describe the shit that Ive seen
But layin in the alley I whispered the Shahada
Bullets fly by from the drive by
So Imam Mohammed might pound on the podium
Popmaster Fabel work it out on the linoleum
Chappelle bust funnies Mos Def bust rhymes
Muhammad Ali is the greatest of all time
Something spiritual happen when them hands get to clappin
Can you tell me what language do you laugh in
The human reaction of smiles and cries
What language are the tears when theyre fallin from your eyes
Youve probably seen the sunrise hundreds of times
But let a painter paint it or a poet describe
The very moment where heaven and Earth might collide
And God let the breath of life come outside
Uh Satan doubted it angels bowed to it
Im so beautifully human and Im proud of it
Soul of a soldier heart of a scholar
I wrote this poem with the blood of a martyr
Imam Mohammed might pound on the podium
Popmaster Fabel work it out on the linoleum
Chappelle bust funnies Mos Def bust rhymes
Muhammad Ali is the greatest of all time

A lot of cats
Get up in an age around
In their early 30s
And they start to think of like lifetime companionship
And thats when they start to meet ladies who
Are not too prone to trust anybody
And they got plenty of history to prove to you
Why they shouldnt trust nobody
I didnt know you then when all that stuff was goin down
Put them other cats away man
And let me try to make somethin in your life

Well baby there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh my God you cant believe
Its happening again
Your babys gone and youre all alone
And it looks like the end
And youre back out on the street
And youre trying to remember oh
How do you start it over
You dont know if you can
You dont care much for a strangers touch
But you cant hold your man
You never thought youd be alone
This far down the line
And I know whats been on your mind
Youre afraid its all been wasted time
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell fell
You didnt love the boy too much
No no you just
Loved the boy too well
Farewell
So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To let them go away
And I couldve done so many things baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin what I left behind
And from worryin bout this wasted time
Oohoohoohoohooh 
Another love has come and gone
Oohoohoohoohooh 
And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
Sometimes to keep it together
Weve got to leave it alone
So you can get on with your search baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasnt really wasted time
",Farewell So you live from day to day And you dream about tomorrow oh And the hours go by like minutes And the shadows come to stay So you take a little something To let them go away And I couldve done so many things baby If I could only stop my mind From wonderin what I left behind And from worryin bout this wasted time Oohoohoohoohooh Another love has come and gone Oohoohoohoohooh And the years keep rushing on I remember what you told me Before you went out on your own Sometimes to keep it together Weve got to leave it alone So you can get on with your search baby And I can get on with mine And maybe someday we will find That it wasnt really wasted time,TranslationsEspaol Well baby there you stand With your little head down in your hand Oh my God you cant believe Its happening again Your babys gone and youre all alone And it looks like the end And youre back out on the street And youre trying to remember oh How do you start it over You dont know if you can You dont care much for a strangers touch But you cant hold your man You never thought youd be alone This far down the line And I know whats been on your mind Youre afraid its all been wasted time The autumn leaves have got you thinking About the first time that you fell fell You didnt love the boy too much No no you just Loved the boy too well

And she told me a story yesterday

Fly on through the sky

Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand youre gonna be my man

And then she took me high over yonder
And I said Fly on my sweet angel

Forever I will be by your side

2916,"I was driving across the burning desert when I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens it was the strings of my guitar
Amelia it was just a false alarm
The drone of flying engines is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue of picture postcard charms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
People will tell you where theyve gone theyll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise others just come to harm
Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm
I wish that he was here tonight its so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt as the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm
A ghost of aviation she was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending on beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
Maybe Ive never really loved I guess that is the truth
Ive spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude
And looking down on everything I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel to shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia dreams and false alarms

3184,"Woe to you oer Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixtysix
I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy
Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
Cos in my dreams its always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah
Night was black was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun Satans work is done
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This cant go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize cant avoid the eyes
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Sixsixsix the one for you and me
Im coming back I will return
And Ill possess your body and Ill make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

4389,"Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze cool and free
Yeah yeah
Fresh off tour Im the best Im sure
More thirsty than before Boy I guess Im raw
Im like James Bond mixed with Julian Bond
Thats why bouncers never frisk the side my toolie is on
Now the venue is bubblin gettin close to a frenzy
Ladies rush up to the front with high hopes to tug me
They lust for me They know Im trustworthy
Rich girls wanna empty out their trust for me
So city by city and town by town
My performance is gritty you know how I get down
And Imma bless you with more than just a nice song
Yeah Imma leave a mark thats lifelong
Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze cool and free
Yeah yeah
Im married to this heart yo I love my spouse
The stage is like my crib and yo I love my house
Im shoppin with switchblades my presence is felt
Anything I desire Imma get it myself
Im prettier smarter wittier harder
Its time to push the envelope a little bit farther
When I touch the mic aint no fuss and fight
And if theres somethin out of line then Ill adjust it right
I can be cool and calm but when the duel is on
Might even spaz on that ass until your cool is gone
I heard you sold your soul for a hundred Gs
Guess thats why all you can rhyme about is pumpin kis
Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life
Like a summer breeze cool and free
Yeah yeah
They say that good things come to those who wait
I found that bad things come to those who hate
So to each his own and when I reach my zone
Hearts throb the hunnies cant leave me alone
See my voice is like an aphrodisiac
Soon as they hear it they dreamin bout me in the sack
See Im sort of like a tutor in Kamasutra
Im like Dexter St Jock when Im punchin the clock
Well enough about my prowess with the ladies
Man the culture is sufferin cause these cowards are lazy
Their whole repertoires consist of jewels and cars
Whats the point Hes just another foolish star
Ooh summer breeze
Makes me feel fine
Thats the way I wanna live my life

7479,"You are now witnessing the demise of the music business
I say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
You know what Im saying
I cant do music with people Im uncomfortable with
You know what Im saying
I cant be on stage with you pouring out my soul if I dont like you
So with that said shout out to Strong Arm Steady
Shout out to Jean Grae
Thats my Blacksmith family you dig
I just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
Rhyming in Greenwich Village circa 1993
Yeah those was the salad days my careers appetizer
The main course a casserole a jambalaya
Of different influences that led me where the music is
A student is only as good as his teachers tutelage
Paying for college not learning was straight foolishness
So I stopped going to school but this was
Hard to tell my parents sat them down tried to get through to them
Started flowing daily and traveled to different places
Freestyled with Clef and Forte in the Booga Basement
With Rubix and Juju on Flatbush my hood amazing
Platinum Island recording with Duro and Just Blaze
And that was right next door to Rawkus whats up Jarret and Brian Blackshaw
And Matt Fingaz Kendra Ross you got the soul of a Stax singer
I love how you always bring it back sister
You and Reesy making every record
I got classics with HiTek and Mos Def that are so respected
Shout out to Corey Smyth shout out to Dave Chapelle
I went on tour with The Roots they played so well
Writing rhymes with Myka 9
Me and Pharoahe Monch were Soundbombing
Me and Lonnie Lynn got a lot in common
Mystik Journeymen introduced me to Top Ramen
On the bus Kanye West would never stop rhyming
Aint no mountain high enough for him he never stopped climbing
Thats why when the homies win I never stop smiling
See Im smiling right now
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt thats how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the God in me
Friends and family yup they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family thats right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up its like you all my fam
Friends and family like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
It started with a blast now Im a iconoclast
Promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
I do this for myself but the song for you
Once I put it out for sale then it belong to you
This for Amani Fela plus Diani Eshe
Your daddy love his girl your mother never far away
This is for Eque this for Kierra Paul
We wanna ride like Ciara and we will never fall
HeadCquarterz and Guru is love forever yall
Make it plain cause its too strong for a metaphor or simile
Your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
Til the end of time whichever come first
Big love to my mom and dad you could have done worse
Jamal and I the way we are cause you put your sons first
Many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
Mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
Voice cracking like Michael Stipe cause everyone hurts
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
No doubt thats how its gotta be
This is my odyssey its just the God in me
Friends and family yup they all a part of me
Cause I would die for them and they would die for me
Friends and family thats right and plus I love my fans
Love when you throw your hands up its like you all my fam
Friends and family like you considered kin
Got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
Nothing else matters more than friends and family
First record was with Mood back in 96
In fact it was pretty fresh Google that find that shit
It sound good I was showing you what timeless is
You couldnt catch what I was saying without rewinding it
Believe me every fan is special
You hear me now but I got fans from Lyricist Lounge and Manifesto
So much wack rap I know its hard to tell the difference
But when I heat it up I make the garbage smell
Im resurrected but Im no savior
I know the game I can ball a little bit Im an OK Player
Double meaning cause the flow is layered

2921,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
Id rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do
Im only just beginning
To see the real you
And sometimes when we touch
The honestys too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you til the fear in me subsides
Romance and all its strategies
Leaves me battling with my pride
But for all the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
Im just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prizefighter
Still trapped within my youth
And sometimes when we touch
The honestys too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you til the fear in me subsides
At times Id like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times Id like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
Ive watched while love commands you
And Ive watched love pass you by
At times I think were drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again
And sometimes when we touch
The honestys too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die

5328,"NT Lyrics
For real though who really got sick flow
On the edge not the ledge hangin out of the window
Bird chest niggas with ya wind of this fear rap
Fuck around youll be minced meat inside of a meal sack
Puny little punks better hit the gym
But that doesnt mean nothin to the heart within
You cramped up you and your team Im amped up
And you asses cant dim my beam
My shine what the fuck is on your mind
Little weakling rappers better hit the grind
Other brothers aint motivated they cant do it
Not only did I penetrate it I ran through it
My music comes on and we mosh at the dance
Inside of your mind or youre inside of my pants
Musical intentions that we have is vast
You sick Drink a NyQuil well Im bed on your ass
Oh well then here comes the gelatin
Tips on some shit is what you yap on your cell to friends
Now your party is completely blown
Real name is Kamaal Im in complete me zone
Its rap time for you that means nap time
Reachin for my joint What the fuck Imma clap mine
Singin songs of sixpence you sit tensed
Surprised your ass at the end like The Sixth Sense
Heavy hitters knocking shit out the park
You didnt even really play tell me why did you start
Spittin sharp blades laced with bleach
You wanna play around kid Im not a walk at the beach
A stroll in the park or your fuckin playground
Put on your headphones tell me how grenades sound
Put on your walk face and go underneath the town
QTip Abstractm how I gets down
All my bitches dance if you know that you damn sure
Let your pussy drip on the dance floor if you wanna
Get down 
Fuck that niggas will bust gats
Better lit a make for their rush that cuz they wanna
Get down 
Flip this piano sick shit
Get down 
Chill you can get off my dick and
Get down 
While Im on the hook get on your good foot
And blow up the spot for all of you niggas cuz thats how we
Get down 
Comin with the brand new quickly we pan to
The young black man with intentions to ban you
Seems that people need an aid today
So many fade away so many fiend to stay
I really rhyme cuz I feel I should say things
While the fraudulent act rap just so they cop rings
Or maybe because when they was young
They was fronted on and left alone to have their own fun
Now theyre all grown up to be assholes
Im giving you the rope will you tie it to lassos
You swing dangling from peach trees
While I sip my Daiquiris in the Southwest breeze
Writings so exciting the pen it keeps
Drippin out jings thats converted to hymns and them
People be hummin it from now to their next of kin
My family is starving You know they want me to win
Me forfeit Nigga please get off it
Send the check in my name to my office
Mutombo in the lane yo I toss it

4313,"Yeah everything everything was the same
Im old enough to know better young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die than live and duck
I gotta set it off Jada Queen and Vivica
The last chick was scared to get that money I cant live like her
Got no problem with you niggas get it how you live it bruh
Its a cold world these mean streets will shiver ya
All I asks is for the same respect that I be givin ya
If not my boy will put the beats on you Karen Civil ya
That boy be on his shoot first never mind the trivia
My advice dont mess with his man word to Nivea
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia
We was candy shopping before 50 and Olivia
Thats when you would go uptown cause you had to re there
Everybody broke back then you had to repair
Drug dealing was cool back then you had to beware
That was the 90s yall wouldnt get it you had to be there
Thats why Im glad to be here some of us never made it
Its hard to get off the ground yall think I just levitated
Yall think it was all love and nobody ever hated
Yall think cause I never state it I never been devastated
All yall see is sunshinin think I was never shaded
Ya think these calendar models is all that I ever dated
Nigga nothing was the same HOT 97 played it
Every day they made it that I stayed with 57 plated
Cant trust nobody the crib is heavy gated
You ask why I tell them even heavens gated
You know why Cause when you good the devil hate it
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted
Attention I never payed it me and this clever lady
She brains do some thangs then we lay together faded
And while I chill loaded up a steel
Just wishin a nigga would but knowin a nigga will
But for real nigga good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will
Still I dont owe these niggas nothing put that in a nigga will
Damned if you do them if you dont dont dont dont
Youre damned if you do them if you dont
But they dont have a heaven or hell to put you through

1540,"All the pumpings nearly over for my sweetheart
This is the one for me time to meet the chef
Oh boy the running man is out of death
Feel cold and old its getting hard to catch my breath
Its back to ash Now youve had your flash boy
The rocks in time compress
Your blood to oil your flesh to coal
Enrich the soil not everybodys goal
Anyway they say she comes on a pale horse
But Im sure I hear a train
Oh boy I dont even feel no pain
I guess I must be driving myself insane
Damn it all Does Earth plug a hole in Heaven
Or Heaven plug a hole in Earth
How wonderful to be so profound
When everything you are is dying underground
I feel the pull on the rope let me off at the rainbow
I could have been exploding in space
Different orbits for my bones
Not me just quietly buried in stones
Keep the deadline open with my maker
See me stretch for Gods elastic acre
The doorbell rings and its Good morning Rael
So sorry you had to wait
It wont be long yeah
Shes very rarely late

What I could make of my life and whod be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening

Theres so much you promised how could I ever forget

You know I love you but Im playing for keeps
Although I need you Im not gonna make this
You know I want to but Im in too deep
So listen listen to me
Ooh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I dont know why
Ooh I know youre going but I cant believe
Its the way that youre leaving
Its like we never knew each other at all it may be my fault

A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shuffling in a shoe shine
Old tin lizzy do it until youre dizzy
Give it all you got until youre put out of your misery
