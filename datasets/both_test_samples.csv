1529,"I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
I took a look at his license plate
It said Just Ice
Is justice just ice
Governed by greed and lust
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must
Oh and the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh sex kills
Doctors pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers havent been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs
Know the balance is undone
Crazy ions you can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh sex kills
All these jackoffs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packing guns to school
The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down
On the massive mess were in
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh sex kills
Sex kills

I feel my temperature rising

Girl girl girl girl
Youre gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming

You light my morning sky
With burning love
Ooh ooh ooh

Burning burning burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love
Its coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Wont you help me

3992,"Never quit until the clock stops
And never die out until your heart drops
Success will separate you from the havenots
And have all these haters at your neck like an ascot
You could do it too young world
I remember being exactly like you young girl
But wait you could do it too young man
See youll be fine as long as on your own two you stand
Keep on living keep on breathing
Even when you dont believe it
Keep on climbing keep on reaching
Even when this world cant see it
No impossible is nothing
Even when you dont believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world cant see it
Impossible is nothing
Got to hate to not have it more than you love to obtain it
Your futures around the corner so close you can almost taste it
It get worse before its better that storm you gone have to weather
Either be a busted pipe or a diamond due to this pressure
25 hours 8 days out the week
Focus keep eyes open victory never sleeps
My prayers for you is that you hit all them goals you trynna reach
I even hope at one point that you take it farther than me
Keep on living keep on breathing

Even when you dont believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world cant see it

I shall never let em see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
And never sell out my soul for any number on a cheque
I shall never let em see me sweat
Promise to want for more until my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
Just promise me when Im gone you wont forget

5421,"I grew up a fucking screwup
Got introduced to the game to the game then fucking blew up
Yeah Dedicated to all my hustlers thats a product of they environment
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man
Yeah Grew up a screw up baby
Got introduced to the game I aint took a breath yet
Lets go
Ever since I was an embryo waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said Wake up and kick out
Roberta and Wayne stayed up and flipped out
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical spit the government chip out
Peace up ATown down and then I dipped out
And oh my gosh the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in even my baby stroller was tricked out
Somebody get him the little niggas out of control
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle Ill dream about diamonds and gold
Gold gold to grow from an infant to toddler was effervescent
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen
Freshing freshing and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now Im grown with more range than a Texan
And Im a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion
Ayyyy
Yall already know what it is
Imma tell you nigga
CT know what it is bout 175
Homey fronted me a zip shit I made it a bird
Thats seventeen and a half all I need is the word
Say the ice is cool but them pots is hot
You better cook slow but that money come fast
I got what you need I hope you brought all the cash
You know the kid pimping all over the world
A hundred carats got me all over your girl
YEAH five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag
A corporate thug I run with a Playaz Circle
I got a Field Mob thatll Disturb your Peace
Blowing Sean Jay all we do is smoke
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head
Whats up
Imma be all the way real with this look
When I came into the game they aint do nothing but doubt me
Now the whole games changed and it aint nothing without me
Picking up my sloppy seconds as they reach for the crown
Only reason you on that song is cause I turned that down
I went from Hot Wheels to big wheels Hyundais to Bentleys
And five course meals no more Popeyes and Blimpies
From alright to handsome from one room to mansions
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From broke as a joke to rich as a bitch I bought a
Plane and a boat and six other whips no MARTA
From dice on the curb to stacking up chips but harder
From birds on my nerves to chicks on my DICK Guard your
Women dawg I went from ashy to classy
Went from a kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
Reach your hand up in the air and you can play with the stars
Its not the hand that youre dealt but how youre playing your cards
Boy

In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty

In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty
Loyalty comes free and smokin weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body
When I was ten years old I seen a nigga take three in the head
Probably around the same time he used to pee in the bed
I stayed awake cause my nightmares was seein em dead
Smelled the burnt tires peelin after leavin him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stared at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin fingers shakin spittin up blood
DNA mixed in the mud another ditch to be dug
There I stood stiffer than wood
See homey used to buy me candy
Now hes gone who gone provide his family
My ear ringing shoulda been runnin
I never thought Id be that sick
Damn I wasnt posed to see that shit
Thats when I thought
It was more than three shots
He coulda been aimin for me maybe he circled around the block
I turned around at my pops he like what happened
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin
I can still hear him laughin
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty
Loyalty comes free and smokin weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody

It was a regular day in South Side sprinklers and kids runnin
All of a sudden heads turnin somebody did somethin
This nigga name I forgot fuck it he lived around the block
Regular gettin money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walked across the park stuntin frontin
Diamonds in his ear diamond watch on
Eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty grabbin her waist
She pushed him away so he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected shorty couldnt accept it
Called him a pussy told him shed be back in a second
But he aint pay her no mind
Called her a bitch about four times
Stayed in the park wit no niggas wit em and no nine
And them in no time older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat left his face all crack
Told him Take all that
Hit him again popped his chain wit a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty
Loyalty comes free and smokin weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty
Loyalty comes free and smokin weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body
Now all my days go by blowin that sticky icky
California made me picky
Chicken head tried to stick me wit a hickey
If we blow up quickly stickly somewhere tipsy
The location dont matter Im South Side until they hit me
Ill be DEAD
If looks can kill Im from the ghetto boys
But I dont know Scarface or Bushwick Bill
My heart spills
For the kids that aint got nothin aint got it still
And for my cousin I lost
Humped over the steerin wheel
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty
Loyalty comes free and smokin weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body
In the streets of New York you cant trust nobody
Niggasll run up on you with a 12guage shotty

5885,"Aha uh yeah yo
Im the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery voice of God
And its hard just being the boss
Being I cant go to jail cause them yearsll cost me
Dont get me wrong lay a nigga down if he force me
Id rather just sit back and roll a Dutch
Think about how Ima put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how Ima get the caine over customs
Never underestimate niggas or overtrust them uh
Yeah them Ms is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it dont jam the TEC will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause Im a nigga that hate to settle
And Im a man of the Lord but I still cant shake the devil
Moved away and still cant escape the ghetto what
The time to talk is up so bring the heat playtime is over
While youre runnin your mouth Im creepin up over your shoulder
A gun a knife a bat a brick anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff start acting up and Ill leave you underground
I know how to get my peers off me
Make em cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
Its a symptom if you bobbing your head you know that hes sick
You know the flow is ridic now throw him a grip
When I get it you already know Im throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere daddy Im throwing them nicks
Thats right homie you cant move me
I aint going nowhere Im in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze a bootleg Uzi
Im just waiting on a Q like Suzie dont lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else thatll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is what up
The time to talk is up so bring the heat playtime is over

Niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you cant do nothing other than flow
Lifes a bitch like the mother from Blow lets go
Dont make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat nigga I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy fresh and new
In the six but its a BM and its Pepsi blue
And I dont know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Yall aint fuckin with Jason
After I cash in theres really no justification
Of how Im gon change the game so dont get out of line
Cause this little nine will change your frame what up

Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven Im taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me Im a sensei

Tools on deck tattoos on necks

Be thankful for all this beauty when its over with forget it

Remembering all of our conversations daily reminiscing you
The hood today they lost can tell they dont know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear its so unfair that Im right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I cant rest and I cant do shit off my mind Im so upset
It wasnt your time to beat me there broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me familiys never forgiving me
I know but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner aint quite the future you wanted for me
Was it And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything Ive known owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me didnt graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me so long had this bottled up
Til we meet in person lets keep speaking through my verses for life
This is your song

Han llegado a ser una miseria insoportable para la gente
Pero hay unas vendepatrias engredos que todava creen
En una sociedad de antes donde los artistas
Fuimos bestias de trabajo para la industria
Ese sueo se ha acabado
Y ahora nos encontramos despiertos en la hora de revolucin
Porque no podemos llamar esto un movimiento si toda la propiedad
Intelectual pertenece a los que nos oprimen
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Motherfucker
Ya te dije
Que se ha acabado la mierda
Nos compraron el alma barata
Hasta la sangre nos sacan atacan
Y con un contrato te atrapan
Pero primero me matan hermano
Porque prefiero morir
Peleando que ser esclavo
Industria sucia
Toma lluvia de acido
Comprende la historia del hiphop clsico
Cuando controlan el negocio y la cultura
La msica se vuelve en comercial basura
Y la reina latina pintada como gallina
Es mas que bailarina o puta en la esquina
Es abogada profesora madre soldada
Y carga nuestro futuro cuando est embarazada
Mira nuestra gente crucificada
Y la manera desgraciada
Que estos perros no hablan de nada
Ms que fiestas y riqueza
Que la gente no tiene
As que ahora vas a ver
La violencia que viene
Un movimiento de verdad ha empezado
Dejamos el imperio corrupto descuartizado
Golpe de estado disparando al presidente
Es hora de revolucin nuevamente
Un movimiento de la gente se ha juntado
Peleando liberando los pueblos encarcelados
Golpe de estado y seramos independiente
Es hora de revolucin nuevamente
Dale llega llega el espaol sin bacteria
This aint that mueve la cadera its that usa tu cabeza
Tu mente tu almendra No pa que baile pa que aprenda
Esta industria me da pena
Same shit misma mierda
El mismo de siempre yo no me muerdo la lengua
Tu camina por el barrio y rincn de la prenda
Vive la prensa
Veneno el guerrillero ya llego
Con el inmortal dicha el gobierno se asusto
FBI CIA gotta pay to get played
Out here in the United States no me interesa ser el Rey
La voz de los Latinos camino sin correr
So wassup

Fuego al firmar te dicen como tirar tu flow

Hermano yo pinto el cuadro
Y el barrio ya esta cansado cabrn
Yo te lo juro que lo que yo sudo es puro
Ustedes son burros
Que venden el culo por el reggaetn
Abre los ojos cojo el presidente les enseo
Como le rompo el cuello al pendejo
Solo con mi can
Yo soy la epidemia la saga las nueve plagas
La misma palabra en la biblia
Que habla de Armagedn
Levanta publico mano te tienen imnotisado
Entrenado inyectandote mierda con la estacin
Perriando quiere decirte que tu eres de la brutas
No te gusta que te llamen puta escucha la cancin

Cant relate to joy he tries to speak and
Cant begin to say

Aint no bitches bending over backwards 
Steady pouring something that I lack

But none of these niggas will step on the scene
And go oneonone they value their health

Your life is in danger when niggas assume
When you fuck around with my money thats doom 
Power to people that hustle like me

All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret Ive got accustomed to
Once it was so right when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadnt met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I dont know why I got so attached
Its my responsibility
And you dont owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im grown Im grown 
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I dont understand why do I stress the man
When theres so many bigger things at hand
We couldve never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
Ill be some next mans other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

And no emotional debts

He must be from the fort he hears the high school girls say
This countrysides burnin with wolfmen fairies dressed in drag for homicide
They hit and run plead sanctuary neath the holy stone they hide
Theyre breakin beams and crosses with a spastics reelin perfection
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant pleadin immaculate conception
And everybodys wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood
Sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep his ankles caked in mud
And I said Hey gunner man thats quicksand
Thats quicksand that aint mud
Have you thrown your senses to the war
Or did you lose them in the flood
That pure American brother dulleyed and emptyfaced
Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight
He rides her low on the hip on the side hes got Bound For Glory in red white and blue flash paint
He leans on the hood telling racin stories the kids call him Jimmy The Saint
Well that blaze and noise boy hes gunnin that bitch loaded to blastin point
He rides headfirst into a hurricane and disappears into a point
And theres nothin left but some blood where the body fell
That is nothin left that you could sell
Just junk all across the horizon a real highwaymans farewell
And I said Hey kid you think thats oil
Man that aint oil thats blood
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm
Or was he just lost in the flood
Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
Some storefront incarnation of Maria shes puttin on me the stare
And Bronxs best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware
Everything stops you hear five quick shots the cops come up for air
And now the whizbang gang from uptown theyre shootin up the street
Whoa that cat from the Bronx starts lettin loose but he gets blown right off his feet
Oh and some kid comes blastin round the corner but a cop puts him right away
He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish
Still breathing when I walked away
And somebody said Hey man did you see that
His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud
I wonder what the dude was sayin
Or was he just lost in the flood
Well hey man did you see that
Lord those poor cats are sure messed up
I wonder what they were gettin into
Or were they all just lost in the flood

Sit back Im about to begin 
I drive up and down Harlem blocks icedout watch
Knots in my socks cops think Im selling rocks
Pulling me over to see if Im drunk but Im sober
They wouldnt fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo youre mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names try to hurt my pride
Youre just mad cause Im a young cat pockets dumb fat
Talking bout Where the gun at I been there and done that
Im through with that illegal life Im staying legit
I love to see cars come cruising by and playing my shit
I walk around with six thou without a pistol my whole cliques wild
Im rich pal no more sticks Im making hits now
I drink Cristal Im through breaking laws
I dont sell coke any more I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes will do whatever it takes
Word up them Federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mousetrap I doubt that
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Aiyo enoughs enough Federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus they want a niggas soul but they know
Big Joey Crack will never rat a cat that he know
For sure death before dishonor I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So Ima keep doing what Im doing
Pursuing my dream till theres enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So wheres your witnesses that you claim to have
Saying that Im taking half extorting New York and not paying tax
Im laid back playing the role laying the low
But its the same old Joe so dont get KOd
Hey yo Im gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid why dont they just let a nigga live
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits

Recorded and ordered supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud kicking live next poet supreme
Loop a troop bazooka the scheme

Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor

And there I go trapped in the KitKat again

7789,"Intro Talib Kweli 
Yo were going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So whenever you hear the word love
Know that its going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated yo
Verse 1 Talib Kweli 
Love is blind you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin the night life lookin for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic then got to frantic
Then things thats normally small become gigantic
Now yall sinkin like the Titanic here come the panic
Being with you like a habit without you I cant stand it
Its tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin a nut off communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned on wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We dont smile anymore and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo see what Im sayin
Its like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife bitches say niggas is
We just dont understand our fundamental differences
Im still learning though actually
I just do what come naturally naturally naturally
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve And I found you 
Verse 2 Talib Kweli 
Women thrive on emotions men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say word
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo wherever you want to go lovell take you there
Lets go you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun thats where Im comin from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin over drums
Word te quiero I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart youre livin in your ocean Im swimmin in
Never drowning got me floatin watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin approachin
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust Ill always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out Ill show you how it could be
Love different language it aint nuttin but a word
A chicken aint nuttin but a bird
Yo yo yo
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve And I found you 
Verse 3 Talib Kweli 
Some of yall in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal thats why Im feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
Thats what your beauty remind me of
Its hard to find a love like ours taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and thats a different thing
Anything but Queen Ill go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you aint got a band
But they dont understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they aint privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language they speak from pain and anguish
Some dont love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like Shit he payin for your rent missin the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
Its more than pillow talk it cant be translated
Learn how to speak it and become emancipated
Its a language
Universal love
Chorus Les Nubians 
Lamour na pas de frontiere Love has no boundaries 
Restes car je taime comme tu es Stay because I love you as you are 
Jai traverse locean du verbe I crossed an ocean of words 
Et je tai trouve And I found you

6674,"BOB Lyrics
One two
One two three yeah
Inslumnational underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground Whoo 
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
You cant stop the train
Who want some dont come unprepared
Ill be there but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin us it aint gon rain
So now we sittin in a droptop soakin wet
In a silk suit tryin not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But thisll be the year that we wont forget
1999 Anno Domini anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig I might just touch hellhot
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm Hammer
Soulgold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home things are wrong
Well not really it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello ghetto let your brain breathe
Believe theres always more ha
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Uno dos tres its on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac bout five niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
Cause we get crunk stay drunk at the club
Shouldve bought an ounce but you copped a dub
Shouldve held back but you throwed the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl fouryearJordan
Never turned my back on my kids for them
Shouldve hit it quit it ragtop
Before you reup get a laptop
Make a business for yourself boy set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four but we on a roll
Hold up slow up stop Control
Like Janet Planet Stankonias on ya
Moving like Floyd comin straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pullin off my belt cause a whippings in order
Like a threepiece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell then I hit the border
Pittypat rappers trying to get to five
Im a microphone fiend tryin to stay alive
When you come to ATL boy you better not hide
Cause the Dungeon Family gon ride ha
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang

Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something

Young black intelligent this is not a first
But it feels like its curse and it weighs like a elephant
Heavy on my mind cause I feel so irrelevant
Heavy on my heart its like Im smart for the hell of it
Heavy on my soul its our stroll through the ville again
Stranded on this island feel like Im Gilligan
Friends got jailed and then they got bailed
Stress that Im under I just wonder when they kill again
Please understand that Im living in the concrete
Jungle where I stumble is the crumble under my feet
In the building lobby see my man Bobby
Puffing on a joint thats the point where our eyes meet
Asked whats the weight on the books in my knapsack
Hes so amused Im confused why he asked that
Then I understand the motive and the plan
Hes trying to be the man while I stand getting laughed at
Dudes got jokes but very little hopes
Thats why they trying to bring me down like a halfback
But I got balanced my moms made a promise
If I get the grades Ill be praised like Thomas
Clarence but I dont know if laws in my future
Cops in the war and theyll sure try to shoot ya
All I wanna do is get a B in geometry
Lose my virginity and live my life drama free sing
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I why be I
Why be me why be me
If I fly if I fly
They gon see  they gon see
I might die I might die
But Ill be free but Ill be free
So why be I why be I
Why be me why be me

Penny for your thoughts a nickel for your dreams
A dime for your goals and a quarter in your jeans
Trying to make a dollar outta fortyone cents
Caught up in the barbed wire shorty on the fence
I can be a knifepacking guntoting hooligan
But I cant decide so Im on my way to school again
On my way to duel again me against the world
But all I can think about is me against a girl
Youthful exuberance busting at the seams
Look at all the other kids cussing at the deans
Looking at all the other kids cutting 8th period
But Im on a team and my coach wont hear of it
Hes well aware of it I aint getting pinched
Yall dummies go ahead I aint getting benched
Whole lot of right and a little bit of wrong
And everything youve worked for Gone
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I why be I
Why be me why be me
If I fly if I fly
They gon see  they gon see
I might die I might die
But Ill be free but Ill be free
So why be I why be I
Why be me why be me

Young Black
In this state of emergency and sense of urgency
Just how young is young
Cause the youth be not youth for long
Young society might be afraid of you
But you continue to be you
We are you so we feel you
For that those that see you
We salute you
Continue to find like minds brah
Design your inside concentration desire
Dedication inspiration perspiration
Is the hard work
Doesnt guarantee anything
But without it you dont stand a chance
Intelligence will save you

Mic check mic check 12 12
Made a lot of mishaps lot of mistakes lot of missteps
Grown shit though is when you can recognize that
And I recognize that and real recognize that
Talk to em
Last word check it unbeatable force insurmountable object
Bull shouldve known better than counting me out Im from the projects
So if I ever do it for greed indeed something is wrong
Prepare for the future remember I used to get heat from the oven on
They wanted to see Budden gone fiendd out on sour
But nobody helped put Budden on had to bring my own power so
Im having a private party that only myself attends
And if the DJ plays the song to my soul itll give itself a cleanse
They telling me all the pain I ever felt was selfinfringed
But I had help from friends one even held the syringe
Architect of my own path Id like to think its designed the best
Defied the odds I never aged while giving time a test
No niggas on house arrest Im on a minor rest
You trying to call me or text me dont even bother
Im trying to give mind a rest
I got a treasure but its content is invisible
Was filled before with shit that I thought I treasured but made me miserable
My affairs together here forever yeah Im back to work
Learned in order to lose love probably gotta have it first
My lifes a crap shoot my dice are loaded aint no stopping me
Most interesting man a hard place is between a rock and me
Im torn within and my eyes are heavy
Im born again just means I died already
Means I survived already so fuck they want with me
World been against me so long misery hates my company
Isolated my whole life not many know who Joseph is
In order to reciprocate love you gotta notice it
Gotta recognize it gotta feel it first
Gotta be let inside it feel its hurt and then kneel to its worst
If you contain it dont hide it gotta reveal it first
And when you think you hit rock bottom gotta feel it worse
Or my rule book is just dated
And for you to truly appreciate it you gotta at least be hated
Mama I made it if anyone know my way was hard
They prayed for my Downfall on deaf ears I was praying to God
So God I loved love till it resented me
And if its still a stranger then I love who it pretends to be
No Love Lost
No love found
They found a little bit though
I dont know where they found it out but it was there
So I guess the moral of the story
Is as you mature so will it
Just gotta find it
One

3055,"Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebbs rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brothers rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brothers rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
Thats where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head
Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And well ask the jury
What verdict they find
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my
Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And hed come to fetch me
To see what theyd done
And well ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for Gods mercy
For soon Ill be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head

Sky high cant touch the level so why try
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged and brother it takes ten to conquer
Thats why Im on probation
Ever since three I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of twotens not from an oven but MAC10
A MAC20 maybe if I didnt subtract ten
My background straight from a Black mans culture
Want more Buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle damn you too hard to handle
EDouble slam once and Redman slam two
Break hooks earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor make mines the PFunk
Make my funk the PFunk
I want my funk uncut Make mine the P 
Make my funk the PFunk I wants to get funked up 
I wants to get funked up

5001,"Hello Americans
My name is George Bush and Im going to do a rap for yall
Check it out
Bitch Im from Texas
Were homophobic and sexist
And if these Mexicans keep coming in Im a dismember em
You dont see me in El Paso selling their tacos
Shit in my el bao Ill cut off your asshole
Goddamn it dont even talk about the faggots
If I ever seen one singing the national anthem Ima strangle em
Hell nah they cant get married but they can fight in the military
Hopefully theyll end up buried in a cemetery
I dont even consider em people
Go ahead put em in the front lines
Next to the Negroes
But Im not racist
Colin Powells like my brother alright I admit it I hate him
Wheres Dick Cheney at Probably off in Iraq
Finding some oil to tap tell em I got up on that
And yall still think it was Bin Laden
When it was us and the Masons plotting on oil profits
Im evil
But yall didnt know though
Now yall stuck with a president that yall didnt vote fo
Unemployment is up the economys in a ditch
Our countrys at war but I dont give a shit Im rich
Im evil
But yall didnt know though
Now yall stuck with a president that yall didnt vote fo
Unemployment is up the economys in a ditch
Our countrys at war but I dont give a shit Im rich
My brother said some racist shit a couple of years back
Then the blacks came out and started to protest and crap
And I knew Id have little hope cause all of sudden
The blacks got together and started to register to vote
But thank God for computers and them helping
Cause we got the last names of every single felon
We programmed the computers to find the names that were the same
Whoever came up couldnt vote on election day
Way to go Jeb really great strategy
We got rid of the majority of black families
And Im not even talking about Dade County
The expired military ballots are bogus counted
Id like to thank my cousin and the help from my pappy
My cousin owns Fox and it made me very happy
He told the entire world that I won
Before the votes were being done counted
And even though Gore had more what matters in the end
Is the Supreme Court and those are my dads friends
So thank you very much and please remember
If you dont vote Ill see you back in November
Im evil
But yall didnt know though
Now yall stuck with a president that yall didnt vote fo
Unemployment is up the economys in a ditch
Our countrys at war but I dont give a shit Im rich

We cant be touched nigga cant you see GUnit 
You do you man cause me Im gon do my thing you know I do my thing
Imma get my drink on and party like its ok
Trust me man its ok bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house theyre like Oh no
50 got em locin again they open again
Got em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting doing my two step fronting
Now Imma tell you what Em told me homey
Just lose the parental discretions advised this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me as I proceed to break it down
Its always off the chain man when Im around
I play the block bumping it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping cause Im sick with flow
You know its sold out like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man thats for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club everybody show me love lets go
You know I got what it takes to make the club go outta control

You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause Im thirsty

In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But in any event keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents into them dollars the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I dont say nothin let me see you swallow
In my crib got the coed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise Im starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden lets go

But we aint come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body

Im tired of this
What is it What are you tired of
Im tired of you not being here
Im here Im here right now Im here right now
The only time I connected with you is via social media
Listen all you gotta do
Are you never home
Im connected right now
You always down the streets all you do is work come home shower get dressed and go the hell out
Am I not a man or another man yeah
Just thought Id be yeah
All we can be
No one can always be kissin undr the mistletoe
Evntually youll be sendin each other missiles and wonderin just where this will go
Even considerin splittin but neither one of you wanna make it official though
That pressure build in the kettle until the whistle blow
I know if ever I left you Id only miss you though
Our love is in a place where theres no time or space
No time to waste on the outside of our divine embrace because of my mistakes
Sometimes we overcomplicate or undercompensate
I try to keep it namaste but youve just got complaints
I say you know me and you told me to get out your face
But you should know your crown is safe
And Im proud to say Id never just vanish without a trace
Whos countin arguments Theres too many to calculate
I know its a sweet and sour taste but when its good its great
Energy and chemistry gets out of symmetry but we can be
Oh you can be good baby oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be
Oh we could be good baby yeyeah
We could be we could be
But all you do is complain
Im like Johann Sebastian the Zohan of fashion
The slow mind really showin no signs of graspin
Go find the caption to explain the neutron and proton attraction thats
Got my wife at home jealous of my microphone
Tellin me shes really been missin the smell of my cologne
That Im too grown to be livin this life of Rock n Roll
That all the tension is really startin to take its toll
And not to mention I really should try to take control
Instead of breakin and takin her where she hates to go
I know its because of the memory she cringes
The door was off the hinges the curtain shredded to fringes
Its crazy seein the same image through different lenses
Id like to say the price we pay shouldnt be that expensive
If somethin isnt righteous its making you apprehensive
But time is workin with us not against us and we can be
Oh you can be good baby oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be
Oh we could be good baby yeyeah
We could be we could be
But all you do is complain
We both going to feel but we aint gotta fight
You can be real fuck tryin to be right
You can be straight with me never tell lies
Easy as cake baby we could be pi
Instead of us trippin you flippin all night
We could be trippin jumpin on flights
And we should just listen Just listen 
We gon disagree shit baby we different
Oh you can be good baby oh
We could be
All you do is complain
We could be we could be
Oh we could be good baby yeyeah
We could be we could be
But all you do is complain

Hes the only soul in the world thats real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Hazy days
Crazy days
Arent you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I dont suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in 63
Ive got a good job and Im newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel all gilt and flash
Remember the gaff where the doors were smashed
Bell Boy
I got to get running now
Bell Boy
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy
Carry this baggage out
Bell Boy
Always running at someones bleeding heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someones heel
Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
Then I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks
The beach is a place where a man can feel
Hes the only soul in the world thats real

But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot
From a life like mine
The secret to me
It aint flown like a flag

Like other music rap is an art
And if you wanna get the feeling got to feel it in your heart
You need brain power dictation
Vocabulary articulation
Creativity and originality
Execution of a feud formality
Versatility and a voice thats loud
With the ability to take a crowd
To its apogee and always has a
Feeling like youre havin a mental orgasm
Makin all minds come to one conclusion
You are the best and its not an illusion

Rockin my beat

For instance
If this record was an atom Id be the nucleus
The center of attention Kool Moe Dee and Im just
Like the core of an apple the priest of the chapel
With the mic in my hand Im like a surgeon with a scalpel
Ready to operate the rhymes that I create
Sounds like music to your ears cause I can combinate
Bass and treble to create a level
Of highs and lows of sounds that goes
With syncopated concretecreated
Beats that meet the standard of a street credit
Gotta critique a rhyme if its weak
You wont wanna speak if your rhymes not peak
With verbs and nouns and adjectives
Combined to make a phrase
Thatll play with a beat
Stop and start slow it down at a part
And totally amaze
The whole crowd leave em in a state of awe
Cause Im as perfect as a diamond without a flaw
And yes Im legendary also very very
Educated proficient and extraordinary
In my field the other rappers yield
A knight in shining armor and the mic is my shield
In rap Im vital the other rappers idol
The best MC and Moe Dees my title
But you can call me Kool

Now when I rock instead of just average Im better
Than the average man and thats why I can
Make a real human feel like a mannequin
I mean a coldheart dummy from the time I walk in
Ill shock ya and amaze ya hit ya then Ill daze ya
Either way Im gonna phase ya cause Im sharp as a razor
When Im rhymin to the cut you know what
Im the best MC many imitate me
They never would admit it they just cant get it
I rhyme like the rest but the juice I possess
Always seems to be more Im a rhyme connoisseur
My taste for the beat is also elite
Im the best hiphopper from off the street
Cause when Im rhymin on the mic I always take control
Cant another rapper touch me with a tenfoot pole
The best 
Rockin my beat 
The best 
I rhyme a 100 miles an hour with lightningspeedin power
Make the sweetest of the sweet MCs look sour
Timber as they tower because I devour
Any other rapper and I can prove it now or
A little bit later cause Im a graduator
From a rhymin alma mater but some say alma mata
Like you say patata I say potato
Tomata tomato my datas up to data
Cause somethin is the matter with those of you say dada
Could mean opposite of mama like the kids at Wonderama
Im very good at actin Im very good at drama
Ill confuse you with a period colon and a comma
Cause when Im rhymin and I take a pause
You think the rhyme is over but when you end yours
Really check out what Im doin then you say ooh
When they say whos the best MC to you
Youll look at me then you say I know who

So many misconceptions Dont be misled 
So many evil deceptions I am

Free with the style I flow like the Nile
But remember dont mistake the smile
Deep rooted is my rhymin
Like ancient African griots precise is my timin
But let me get to the essence of what Im sayin here
Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there
The systematic fanatics are at it again
Tryin to kill me and all of us my friend
But dont bend to the mental strain
Against all odds we must strive for essential gains
Be true to the life the Lord gave ya
And thats a message from the lifesaver

It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight
Than to set one off knowledge Ill let some off
Cause nowadays everybodys a killer
And as for me no other MC is iller
But still a thorn scrapes my heart
When I see another life thats been torn apart
Over nonsense no law no order its evidence
That the money only takes precedence
Cause everybody wants power
While the innocent are born or die during every hour
I scowl as I look upon evil
But I must have the strength to spark awareness in my people
And we will learn to respect our neighbors
Another message from the lifesaver

8114,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit It was now midAugust which meant he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months Two months and all he had to show was three dogeared letters and two very expensive longdistance phone calls True when school had ended and shed returned to Wisconsin and he to Locust Pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity She would date occasionally but merely as amusement She would remain faithful
But lately Waldo had begun to worry He had trouble sleeping at night and when he did he had horrible dreams He lay awake at night tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector tears welling in his eyes as he pictured Marsha her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some neanderthal finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion It was more than the human mind could bear
Visions of Marshas faithlessness haunted him Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts And the thing was they wouldnt understand how she really was He Waldo alone understood this He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche He had made her smile She needed him and he wasnt there Awww 
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers Parade was scheduled to appear Hed just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons lawn for a dollar fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America inquiring into his awning needs At least they cared enough to write
It was a New York company You could go anywhere in the mails Then it struck him He didnt have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion true but why not mail himself It was absurdly simple He would ship himself parcel post special delivery The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment He bought masking tape a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build He judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably A few air holes some water perhaps some midnight snacks and it would probably be as good as going tourist
By Friday afternoon Waldo was set He was thoroughly packed and the Post Office had agreed to pick him up at three oclock Hed marked the package Fragile and as he sat curled up inside resting on the foam rubber cushioning hed thoughtfully included he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door saw the package tipped the deliverer and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person She would kiss him and then maybe they could see a movie If hed only thought of this before Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up He landed with a thud in a truck and was off
Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair It had been a very rough weekend She had to remember not to drink like that Bill had been nice about it though After it was over hed said he still respected her and after all it was certainly the way of nature and even though no he didnt love her he did feel an affection for her And after all they were grown adults Oh what Bill could teach Waldo But that seemed many years ago
Sheila Klein her very very best friend walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen Oh gawd its absolutely maudlin outside
Ach I know what you mean I feel all icky
Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table licked her finger and made a face Im supposed to be taking these salt pills but she wrinkled her nose they make me feel like throwing up Marsha started to pat herself under the chin an exercise shed seen on television God dont even talk about that She got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins Want one Supposed to be better than steak and then attempted to touch her knees I dont think Ill ever touch a daiquiri again
She gave up and sat down this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone Maybe Billll call she said to Sheilas glance Sheila nibbled on a cuticle After last night I thought maybe youd be through with him I know what you mean My God he was like an octopus Hands all over the place She gestured raising her arms upwards in defense The thing is after a while you get tired of fighting with him you know and after all I didnt really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him You know what I mean She started to scratch Sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth Ill tell you I felt the same way and even after a while here she bent forward in a whisper I wanted to Now she was laughing very loudly
It was at this point that Mr Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang the doorbell of the large stuccocolored frame house When Marsha Bronson opened the door he helped her carry the package in He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had gotten out of her mothers small beige pocketbook in the den
What do you think it is Sheila asked Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room I dunno
Inside the package Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the muffled voices Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton Why dont you look at the return address and see who its from Waldo felt his heart beating He could feel the vibrating footsteps It would be soon
Marsha walked around the carton and read the inkscratched label Ah god its from Waldo
That schmuck said Sheila Waldo trembled with expectation Well you might as well open it said Sheila Both of them tried to lift the staple flap
Ah sst said Marsha groaning he must have nailed it shut They tugged on the flap again My God you need a power drill to get this thing open They pulled again You cant get a grip They both stood still breathing heavily
Why dont you get a scissor said Sheila Marsha ran into the kitchen but all she could find was a little sewing scissor Then she remembered that her father kept a collection of tools in the basement She ran downstairs and when she came back up she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand This is the best I could find She was very out of breath Here you do it IIm gonna die She sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap but the blade was too big and there wasnt enough room God damn this thing she said feeling very exasperated Then smiling I got an idea
What said Marsha
Just watch said Sheila touching her finger to her head
Inside the package Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe His skin felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart beating in his throat It would be soon Sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package Then she sank down to her knees grasped the cutter by both handles took a deep breath and plunged the long blade through the middle of the package through the masking tape through the cardboard through the cushioning and thud right through the center of Waldo Jeffers head which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun

2994,"The lightning express from the depot so grand
Had started out on its way
All of the passengers that were on board
Seemed to be happy and gay
But one little boy who sat by himself
Was reading a letter he had
You could plainly tell by the look on his face
That the contents of it made him sad
The stern old conductor then started his round
Taking tickets from everyone there
And finally reaching the side of the boy
He gruffly demanded his fare
I have no ticket the boy then replied
But Ill pay you back someday
Then Ill put you off at the next stop we make
But he stopped when he heard the boy say
Please Mr Conductor
Dont put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away
A girl sitting near was heard to exclaim
If you put him off its a shame
Taking his hand a collection she made
The boys way was paid on the train
Im obliged to you miss for your kindness to me
Youre welcome she said never fear
Each time the conductor would pass through the car
The boys words would ring in his ear
Please Mr Conductor
Dont put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day

And heroes they come and they go
And leave us behind as if were supposed to know

And why must we grow up so fast

Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend its nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember places to go
Pretty maids all in a row

Here comes Dark Gable raps remarkable
The mic ripper cash flipper Cristal sipper
Derriere batalliere thats French for ass whipper
Long time puttin work in this to be tremendous
If Im not the best then Im a damn strikin resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attackin this enrage to disengage the missin page
To the newest in age thats hittin stage
Now why that be For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat if you was Rosa Parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man that make
Rhymes that be so butter my breath smell like Land OLakes
You know the lick see me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean the SAT
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory but heres the Kane story come on 
Bringin you that uncut pure knockin at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky
Ah man fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do its as if you
Was invisible itll make your life miserable
HipHop icon keep a grip just like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that player hatin out you
Thats the other side of the game and I aint Erykah Badu
Black Caesar dont you even reach my way
You soon to find a vital point thats on Priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhymin
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen done need alignment
The untouchable dont want to tempt me
I come kickin through your door unlawful entry
It be me even though none of yall want to see me
For real damn I know how Jehovahs Witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Because I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
I turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldnt bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex
I come cuttin through split his gut in two
I touch em what him do You know the style aint nothin new

Get on down baby we keep it live
A good game it lets the plot thicken
But the thing that just aint clickin is the way yall legalize trickin
You talk about your ride when you dont even got one
But I can pull a hot one when inside of a Datsun
The wicked in the bed plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game its like my tongue got infra red
Let the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as Im guttin em black
Closest thing to me would be whats that Nothing in fact
I come with more in skill to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill sweeter thing than Lauryn Hill
As I return with a vengeance here comes the day of independence
Approach em all with some bad intentions
In other words Im makin em resign
Diminish mine runnin through em like a finish line

3712,"Now everyone complaining how the bar is low
Travel in rabbit hole and see how far it goes
The conveyor of light is shining like an oracle
If you know what the game is missing what you snoring for
If you calling it dead youre adding onto the death
If you aint resurrecting it judgement and resentment hard for those
Grab a pen and pad and show them all how too flow
Could be since you know everything go on and spark the ho
Resurgence of lyricism aint current apparent the yearning the colorful ways of busting
No other could ever enter the zone
Image alone couldnt give you the throne
Man you bugging I thought you was pissed why you sitting at home
Chilling this isnt some cold
The start of this is some whole another other dimension travelling through infinite zones
You aint adding onto the pot in the kitchen be gone
And stop blaming it on the industry my nigga be grown

I eat a rapper like a plate of Okra and Potatoes
Hoping you make it with an array of monotonous phrases on top of the pay
I say on top of the fake emcees can make up shit like they make up shit
It doesnt take a bit of talent to do what they do the game is fully jaded yeah 
Im contradicting the first verse now I tried so hard not to go in notice moment like everything is fabulous
Because it would be hate if I critique and talk about all the whackness that is blatant I can see
These artists arent really nourishing I cant wait until I can eat
They arent garbage theyre like all the bacon I can eat
Im lyin everybodies lying too take a higher fee
And sell out so when you go too hell tell satan bye for me

7930,"Real Niggaz New Version Lyrics a different version than all previous releases
Every motherfucker always asks how did NWA get started
We dont know how it got started
Fuck that question you know what Im saying
Its the same bullshit over and over
How did we get started
How did we first meet
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo you shouldve covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you was a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker
Dont try to hang you best avoid it
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemrroids
Before you try to fuck with Ren
Ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting the size 10
First come first serve whoevers got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the world of the motherfucking HipHop maniac
Brainiac so what you ought to do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think your rap would last
With your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo be original your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you motherfucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums for many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles
Cheating and not beating the crowd are kept seating
But weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
And got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo giving what I gotta give doing what I gotta do
You dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
You cant harm me alarm me
Cause were the generals in this fucking HipHop army
The niggas with attitudes if you didnt know
We blow flow and then move slow from the get Go
Yo tie us to take it
Yo fuck this shit Yella kick the break in
Its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
You can run but you cant hide you know Im a find you
Cause a nigga like Ren is only two steps behind you
Dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep with the lights on forget that the Mics on
Dont step on my motherfucking stage without Nikes on
Dont say its psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
All these niggas with the gibber gabber
But couldnt kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer
Gangsters in black are out there
But only because yo its the shit that we wear
On my motherfucking dick
But Ima love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
So yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
Youll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead
Black the good the bad the ugly you see
A little street wise nigga you know me
Rolling with some real niggas playing for keeps
But you motherfuckers know who run the streets
With that hardcore HipHop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get
Trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
Since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
Cause Im the motherfucker thats out to kill
EazyE a nigga thats real
Timed bomb count down 
Real niggas straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without a second thought
And if your ass get smoked its my bullet you caught
So if youre talking shit about the niggas in black Explosion 
Bow down to the Kings and Raider hats
They played out thats what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we aint happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
Yet so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes Ill come like a fucking bump
Asking for fucking money dont buy you a fucking crumb
Youre on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
Because if I let you slide its just cause you lucked up
Dont come in my face again because Im a floor you
And if youre a bitch Ima fucking ignore you
Because my attitude is a little bigger
Cause MC Ren is one of the Real Niggas
Lost in a motherfucking world of madness
Sadness but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucking motherfuckers like you making whack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When Im expressing standstill like youre full of Rigor Mortis
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess you figure
You can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
A nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out with too much cargo
So Im glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo NWA criticized for what we say
But Ima do the shit anyway
Cause Im the motherfucking doctor never faking
Yo Yella kick the motherfucking break in
Its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
Yeah motherfucker its the real thing
You are now  Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
NWA Straight Outta motherfucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990s

852,"I got lost on the road somewhere
Was it Texas or was it Canada
Drinking whiskey in the morning light
I work the stage all night long
At first we laughed about it
My longhaired drunken friends
Proposed a toast to Jimmys ghost
I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end
Im stuck here on the inside looking out
Im just another case
Wheres my makeup wheres my face on the inside
All got your kicks from what you saw up there
Eight bucks even buys a folding chair
I was downing seagrams on another flight
And I worked that stage all night long
You were screaming for the villain up there
And I was much obliged
The old road sure screwed me good this time
Its hard to see where the vicious circle ends
Im stuck here on the inside looking out
Thats no big disgrace
Wheres my makeup wheres my face on the inside

So I was mean but I still had a scheme
17 years young everything seemed fun
Still considered a veteran cause I feared none
Puns from the street where there aint no rules
But carried heat cause he aint no fool
Aint no room for dollars in negative digits
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us cause weve been down since the
Genesis 200 horse power to 400 Pegasus
The messages dont sleep till its over
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin over Im still in the water drownin
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now im ice forever
Stomach bustin out the white carrera

Check part of the plan she told my son I wasnt the man
I aint gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldnt silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor
Im not going to hit her Im gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin high now no more whiteout send the cubans
To provide now its my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Aint nothin change im still humble and modest
And im always proud to admit I came straight from the projects

All for one one for all
This is motherfucking beautiful
Talk to em baby
This for the cold Ds that wont snitch
For the murderers that wont miss
For the hustlers thatll front bricks
For the hoodrats that want chips
For the stickup kids creepin with they Pumps ripped
For lil shorty with his rhyme books
Black girls going to school carrying like 9 books
For the hood niggas
That go to work because parole but they tryin to be good niggas
For all the poor mothers
Thats always goin through the struggle still screamin that the Lord Love us
For the ghetto life
For having to hold your metal tight lookin for a better life
For the family
For if Im rich you rich and that shits a guarantee
For the best of life
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life
We thugs my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto my niggas
Any time any place we dont give a fuck we bust metal my niggas
We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
Watch what you sayin cause we shank you my niggas
We DBlock niggas we dont play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas
Aiyyo yo Imma shed blood for mine thats one ritual
Thats how you keep the love unconditional
Thats why we the only one the thugs listen to
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do
I know a few dudes doin life bids in jail
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale
But that how life is
And that how the gun and the knife is
Its a shame but its real when your enemies like ya
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper
Listen it aint the rappers its the rats that worry me
Double R for life DBlock til they bury me
Scared niggas shed off
Or stand way in the back and aim they gat up in the air and
Let off
Thorough niggas tear nigga head off then let the blood keep drippin
And just wipe the sweat off
Fuck with P the thugll come out
The slugll come out
You dont put in enough work I got chu
No doubt
They dont want Sheek to wild
Betta cover ya child
With two guns out the sunroof
Swordfish style
Who that kid
Black mask on with the latch on the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag
You get it in a hurry
All up in your Burberry
Through your assisstant
Through your fucking secretary
All yall do me a favor
Walk with me
If you want money or drugs
Talk with me
Know I got my niggas my guns
Now hawk with me
Guess who Jada P and The Sheek
Three bricks
Three whips
Three motherfucking ouies a week
Ten spots OT
Two blew off leak
My niggas cop
Pop and toss and we applying the pressure
So when you address us
Its Boss

All is your world aint nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut Just jealous of everybody thats headed out on that BobLo boat It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks Aw man I wish I was joining youa little cheese and crackers a little Cana wine a little Riunite on ice some Harveys Bristol Creambut lets do this only on Smooth FMÂ 
Nothing compared to our family trips
My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
All this handmedownshit I had had an uncanny fit
All the gangstas I had in my family had me antibitch
My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
That was back fore I was born
Pop told stories bout it that would last for hourslong
And as a family we was just so happy
When him and mama got along on the BobLo boat
Uh on our way to that black amusement park
Wood rollercoasters crack sold on plastic scooter cars
Uh smoking grass at the vintage food court
Broken glass waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
I came across my identity on the BobLo boat
Thats where I lost my virginity no condom though
Thats when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
Parties on the way to the island would be the livest though
First time big bro hit the bottle was on the BobLo boat
But neither one of us knew that we would both
Grow up and turn to alcoholics thoughBobLo boat
Hey hey hey lil Craig come here Aye hit this nigga Nigga dont worry bout what the fuck it is just drink
Yeah yeah yeah
Some of my better times I shared with you
I shared with you yeah
Shit all of my better days I shared with you
I shared with you shit
And now I gotta wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up
Shit stuck inside a rat race fuck 
Rat race fuck fuck 
Wake up wake up wake up wake up again
Stuck inside this rat race fuck 
Yeah look
Twist the cap lift the bottle back swig it
Dig it teninch rims on my mamas Civic
Teninch woofers in the trunk to be specific
They bump rattle the license plate plus the windows tinted
Dont even give a fuck that its dented bitch Im the man now
Im rolling driving it slow as if its stolen
Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci lets check her
Double Ds like doubledeckers I wanna sex her
But these keys dont come with game on how to finesse her
Five semesters left until college Im under pressure
Im not a real nigga til I undress her I gotta press her
This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
Nowadays I often yearn to press the
Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
My reallife trauma
Plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
Jermaine Lamarr but thats insane it couldnt be further left of
The truth is that my new shit slap you never heard it better
Give me a sec I murder sectors prefer to let ya
See it rather than say it but it spill out I gotta chill out
Say Fuck the world and never pull out
We had no BobLo boat
But I could note those times just like a Bible quote
BC before cell phones the first time I would smoke
I was six years old but thats for another chapter
Thats for another story to God be the glory
I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking bout dumb days
Thinking bout dumb days
This is 808Ray

Hooked on necropolis
Addict of metropolis
Do the worm on the acropolis
Slamdance the cosmopolis
Enlighten the populace
Hungry darkness of living
Who will thirst in the pit
Hooked in necropolis 
She spent a lifetime deciding
How to run from it
Addicts of metropolis 
Once fate had a witness
And the years seemed like friends
Girlfriends 
Now her child has a dream
But it begins like it ends
Shot into eternity
Methadone kitty
Iron serenity

It is heroin pity
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
Strung out committee 
Walled out of the city
Clubbed down from uptown
Sprayed pest from the nest
Run out to barrio town
The guards are itchy 
Forced to watch at the feast
Then sweep up the night
Flipped pieces of coin
Broken bottles 
Exchanged for birthright

Grafted in a jiffy 
Not tear gas nor baton charge

Was bounced out of the room
Jean Arthur Rimbaud 
By the bodyguards of greed
For disturbing the tomb

His words like flamethrowers
Paris commune 
Burnt the ghettos in their chests
His face was painted whiter
And he was laid to rest
Died in Marseille

Buried in Charleville 
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city

4902,"Sometimes I phase out when I look at the screen
And I think about my chance for me to intervene
And its up to me to bring back the hope
Put feeling in the music that you could quote
Not saying that I hate it cause yea I kinda dig it
But what good is a ear if a QTip isnt in it
So to stick it in to inform your friend
Your boy from the hood is on that shit again
He has upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries
To splash on the mass from low to upper class
And when the records spins and sometimes blows a wind
A fickleness of friends they sometimes hate again
They always bring up Tribe I mean can I survive I mean
Cause this is my mans on me this is my fams
And heres somethin new its front row for you
So dont misconstrue its Tribal and true
My dudes who hustle hard dont stop your repertoire
As long as you could see its you whos stayin we
Cause life is filled with pills and little pearls and shit
Im fuckin up I mean Im trippin up
But still there is a void them people get annoyed
Lets focus is on the feel before we get a deal
Come on
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
Figuring out where we should be
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
With the vibe we came to put back on the street
Lets take care of ours and ensure we eat
And Oprah an em they criticize the boys
Without empathy they lose all their boys
They cant keep us down were dominate and brown
And those other shades they join our parade
But wait theres rain ahead like Brit and Kevin Fed
And magazine debris is shit she gotta see it
Im no different to you I goes through it too
I thumbs through the page I dont come of age
Im not a deity Im far from perfect see
I roll the tumble weed its just a humble scene
That I present to you is just a mister crue
Who burrs a harmony and soon a melody
That speaks to where we are the door I hopes ajar
And soon were walkin in a blip its just to say Come on
Figurin life can be a thing the wilderness is wild to me
But youre not alone I see were just the same
Figuring out where we should be

7642,"Hey yo remember that shit Eazy did a while back
Motherfucker said it wasnt gonna work
That crazy shit
Yeah the stupid shit man
That shit was dope
Hey yo Eazy
Wassup
Hey man why dont you come off the piano for a minute and bust this crazy shit
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas at the pad throwin up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought the fools kept steppin
Jumped in the fo hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin new shit by NWA
It was Gangsta Gangsta at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit it went somethin like this
Cruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there coldshootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo man
Get the fuck out
Pump that beat
Mothafucka say what
Donald Bs in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12gauge
One sucker dead LA Times front page
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yo Leroy
Beer drinkin breath stinkin sniffin glue
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath starts stinkin
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappyass weave
She started talkin shit wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Who do you think you are Mr Big Stuff
Rock mothafucka like the hard three the hard way
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped the sixfo round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
Ill throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
LA playa
Big Drum beater
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of the court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out Fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didnt hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder
Cause the boys n the hood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy cause I aint said shit
Yeah I kicked a little ass
But that was a blast from the past mothafucka

4446,"In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that hes been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you about his years
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all
Whistles shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud no more tears
Surely a war noone can win
Killing time about to begin
Home far away
From the war a chance to live again
Home far away
But the war no chance to live again
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no mans land God only knows
Into jaws of death we go
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns cant hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat
Home far away
From the war a chance to live again
Home far away
But the war no chance to live again
Home far away
From the war a chance to live again
Home far away
But the war no chance to live again
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale
",I heard the angels cry Pray to God no more may die So that people know the truth Tell the tale of Paschendale Cruelty has a human heart Every man does play his part Terror of the men we kill The human heart is hungry still I stand my ground for the very last time Gun is ready as I stand in line Nervous wait for the whistle to blow Rush of blood and over we go Blood is falling like the rain Its crimson cloak unveils again The sound of guns cant hide their shame And so we die in Paschendale Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire Running straight at the cannon fire Running blind as I hold my breath Say a prayer symphony of death As we charge the enemy lines A burst of fire and we go down I choke a cry but no one hears Feel the blood go down my throat Home far away From the war a chance to live again Home far away But the war no chance to live again Home far away From the war a chance to live again Home far away But the war no chance to live again See my spirit on the wind Across the lines beyond the hill Friend and foe will meet again Those who died at Paschendale,In a foreign field he lay Lonely soldier unknown grave On his dying words he prays Tell the world of Paschendale Relive all that hes been through Last communion of his soul Rust your bullets with his tears Let me tell you about his years Laying low in a blood filled trench Killing time til my very own death On my face I can feel the falling rain Never see my friends again In the smoke in the mud and lead Smell the fear and the feeling of dread Soon be time to go over the wall Rapid fire and the end of us all Whistles shouts and more gun fire Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb Be reunited with my dead friends soon Many soldiers eighteen years Drown in mud no more tears Surely a war noone can win Killing time about to begin Home far away From the war a chance to live again Home far away But the war no chance to live again The bodies of ours and our foes The sea of death it overflows In no mans land God only knows Into jaws of death we go Crucified as if on a cross Allied troops they mourn their loss German war propaganda machine Such before has never been seen Swear
5937,"I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me
No
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And thats just the way it is
Couldnt tell me I was loved when I needed it
When all I ever wanted was love
Shoulda told me just because
Im worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
Theres something awesome about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And thats just the way it is
I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldnt love you perfectly with fear in my head
So I perilously had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said
So I could love you better
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And thats just the way it is
BSec
And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldnt stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my selfworth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot years I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind
Chorus
I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby its not an excuse I give
And Id do it all again because for you I live

Hey baby its not an excuse I give
And Id do it all again because for you I live

5520,"Hey Chuck we got some nonbelievers out there
Yo we got to do somethin about that man
Yo we got to get stupid
Yo we gotta let em know what time it is
You go ooh and aah when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
No matter who you are when Im up to par
I betcha go hip hop hurray or hurrah
But the aahs and oohs is my kind of news
Pop your tape in put your car in cruise
I never heard the boos I never drank booze
Cause I just rock the rhythm left alone the blues
The LI mystique you sneak to peek
A look and then you know that were never weak
I know you cant wait its never too late
No fear Im here and everything is straight
Cycles cycles life runs in cycles
New is old no Im not no psycho
The monkey on the back makes the best excel
The people in the crowd makes the rock well
The people in the back lets you know whos wack
And those who lack the odds are stacked
The one who makes the money is white not black
You might not believe it but it is like that
When you come to my show watch me throw
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
When you make a move new not used
And watch the bro here just bust a groove
A fat lady soprano loads my ammo
Hear my jam with a funky piano
Easy on the wall but hard on the panel
A fool smokes Kools cause he chokes on Camels
In effect the crews in check
Run by the posse with the gold around the neck
Homeboys in heat lookin for sweet
Ladies in the crowd so they can meet
Somebody to body makin a baby
Givin it to grandma then makin her crazy
Im a MC protector US defector
South African government wrecker
Panther power you can feel it in my arm
Lookout yall cause Im a timebomb
Tickin tockin all about rockin
Makin much dollars while the crazy ones clockin
The rhythm to shake the house downy down
Bounce to the ounce sound so crown
The man the enemy Public King no thing
All fall to the force of my swing
Like Ali Frazier Thriller in Manila
Pinpoint point blank microphone killer
Am I no need to lie got the Flavor Flav
To prove Ill win and if not the save
Ill pick up rack up put your whole shack up
Just choose to lose the bet emcee stick up
This is the wiz but the mics not his
Its mine one time let the star shine
And Im tellin you yellin at you youre through
Dont think youre grown cause your mustache grew
Im number one you know it weighs a ton
And Ill be the burger you can be the bun girl
Surroundin my steady poundin
Get on down to my funky sound and
Rock the rhythm rhyme one time your mind
Rhythm roll twotime control
The mauler and the caller of your doom
And when Im ready to leave youre gonna know I go boom
Three times yall rhythm rhyme and rock
Then youll that the D is on the block
Four times yall and never ever the wack

5572,"Uh yeah
Made in Black America metaphor for a predator
Been to the Mediterranean on my papers like a editor
I flow like a reservoir dog
Rap Tarantino off the chain like Django
Still let the chain glow where they bang though
And niggas get shot like camera angles
In rap videos put up on Vimeo
Im where the buck 50 bicentennial perennial allstar
Fruit that dont fall far from Islam
When rap is dead I had the fluid that embalm
I speak you know Im in the building like an intercom
Enter Com the worlds most
Intricate integrated with imminent
Domain Im feeling myself like a sentimen
Tal letter written to myself
Aspirin for greatness wellness and wealth Im cold Im hard to melt
Uhh Im more than a hot song or a hot album
Ask my ex I still live on like Malcolm
My spirit and style done a transformation
Make room nigga I dont need reservations
You sweet as a hotel I stay presidential
Strange to be sinful and know that Heaven sent you
To rearrange the mental Ive seen things weve been through
Its hard for a man to claim gentile let me change the tempo
I be with broads that got they shit together
Even if it aint meant forever still smoke the spliff together
The essence of the herbs the presence of the words
Yeah you got a chest but Im treasurin your curves
You walk past Ima look behind you
Look you up and down to find you
Can see I was designed to give you power and refine you
You fucking with me we can grind to
Gather the better Black America
Yeah made in Black America takin threats from a terrorist
We will never meet but the media feed hysteria
And I be inferior if I be in fear of ya
More godly than gluttonous but my suppers superior
You know the difference tween the kids with the lunch tickets
And the ones with the money in the cafeteria
I break bread with with my brethren like a pizzeria
Spinnin dough youll find red dots over cheese be a
Ware of your whereabouts dont be feeble
Im pissed off tinkle is the onomatopoeia
Yous just a little star twinkle sure aint me
Been a superstar since ma made me
My president is black uhh 
I wonder if Pac thought we was ready for that or did we move too fast
I dont give a fuck shit my grandpa glad
They pass that gun law or not niggas still gon pop up dead
Yeah Im the Morpheus in this hiphop matrix exposin fake shit
Used to borrow dollars now my sense aint so common
Went across the whole nation screamin Hiiipower HiiiPower 
Never been a racist but I love horsepower
Im hot thats why I got the fans in the stands
Em fans googlin enemies shakin hands
Restorin the balance detourin the malice
We kill you motherfuckin mice with a mallet uhh 
This is Huey P Newton with a QP
Bobby with a Seale Fred Hampton on pills
In the Hamptons now thats ill whats happenin
Im just trying to teach my homies bout the Emerald tablets
Stop the war in Syria over a bowl of cereal
Kill a instrumental then book a flight on Expedia

7967,"Yo just think if you could rewind time
And start your life all over again
What would you give and what would you keep
You heard me what would you keep
Yo yo if I could go back I wouldnta sold no crack
Wouldnta never put my hands around no gat
But you know Loon bein all hardheaded
And dont listen even if God said it
I didnt have to stick with folks that sniff no coke
I didnt have to fix the block when shit was broke
Same cats I helped was twistin smoke
Now imagine if I went to school went to class
Stead of bein a young cat sent to blast
Sent to slash criminals necks in half
For playin dumb when I come to collect my cash
And cuz of that cats will respect my past I aint playin
If I start from scratch Id sign with Def Jam
Nah fuck am I saying Puffs the best man
Plus Imma Bad Boy Im more like a bad man
Put mo niggas in pits than Brad man
Cant dodge bullets Too bad man
Shit Id a copped the five instead of the six
That way wouldnt of crashed and killed my cousin
Keep quiet instead of having the industry buzzin
Do a devils advocate style dont let em see you comin
Use the revolver when bustin and sluggin
That way no evidence
But fuck it got money to be tried worse come to worse
Who God bless no man curse hatin niggas lay in the dirt
Yo if you could start your life from scratch What What 
Rewind time and still go back Its time to eat 
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at
If you could start your life from scratch What What 
Rewind time and still go back About to kill it 
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at
Come on come on
Yo if I could start life from scratch I wouldnt change shit
Same gun same clip same dumb bitch
All Out Harlem World same old clique
Same old studio same old shit
Shit dont change just because a cop took six to the brain
Meeno got a lawyer man Im hip to the game
You could find a gun but if my prints aint on that thing
What is you sayin
And on the same block that I get my Glocks from
You see the same cop that get popped with the shot gun
Mysonne Mysonne 
And at the same bodega I got my tops from
Mysonne Mysonne 
I give the same old money to the same cops bum
If I could start from scratch Id bring daddy back
And put five in the first cat that show mami crack
I sit back and listen to them drunks on the block
Tryin to school me with jewels tellin me who to watch
I killed five people Id let survive
And the five I took away Id a left alive
If I could do all it again Id bring Virg back
Or I switch places with him I hope you heard that
I would have prefered that I aint have to starve
Pitch crack have to rob and catch a charge
And Id do it all again if I had to
Pitch nowin to win and Id be glad to
And Id hit every target I took aim at
But Id still be a problem you cant change that
Im a problem
Yo if you could start your life from scratch Uh 
Rewind time and still go back All Out 
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at And Double Up 
If you could start your life from scratch Bad Boy Bad Boy 
Rewind time and still go back
Yo I really dont know whats goin on 
What would you change in the way that you live today
Im tellin ya I really dont know whats goin on 
And what would you leave right where its at
Come on come on
Yo cuz half the cats that flip we all was cool
And half the chicks I hit they teased me in school
I got a baby by a lady I dont even love alot
Wish I wore three rubbers case the first rubber popped
But you cant cry now milk already spilt
I had eleven friends and ten already killed
Went down south and I aint feel the guilt
And I aint ready to war but that aint the way built
And for all the nights and all the fights
That I had for all this money over all these dice
All my cars and homes and all my ice
If I could do it all again Id do it all for Christ
Whoever thought the limelight or the superstardom
Whoever thought thered be a problem comin through Harlem
Cant even chill cats wanna make me a villian
Cats that I grew up with I gotta contemplate killin
Nobody love me Im my own mister and on my own mister
Mama did what she could but now Im grown mister
Though she told me once wish shed told me then
Though Im the youngest Imma grow to be the oldest man
And cats thinkin they gon win cuz they veterans
Aint about age at this stage man with the most cheddar win
How you live right Every day get in bigger sin
How you say no at the door screamin Let me in
From the outside its lookin gooder than it ever been
To tell the truth when I was broke it was better then
All Out 33rd street
Yo if you could start your life from scratch
Rewind time and still go back
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at
If you could start your life from scratch
Rewind time and still go back
What would you change in the way that you live today
And what would you leave right where its at

Dope boy they got trust issues
Never imagined being stuck with you
Years later we in the villa suites
Top back we on vanilla seats
Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes but you didnt cheat
Cold nights when you couldnt sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
CClass helped you see past
All them other hoes and that they niggas weak
Whoo Im good money
Got you talking in dollar signs
Its all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
I dont blame her I dont change her
I just sit back and give her options

I just need some time
These requirements
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring with your bowlegged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacksll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
Butll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play acki
And again I say I like these hoes

One day youll see and agree with me
Unless youre gonna be a freak until youre 93
For you theres no fee everything is free
This is from me to you not you to me
Every night is your night your leather pants are tight
You try to shake your butt with all your might
I dont really wanna diss nobody
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi
But thats not the problem the problems Yvette
How bad can a girls reputation get
See shes the kinda girl all the homeboys met
If youre desperate ask Yvette cause shell say Bet

Let me explain to you who is talkin
Im LL Cool J from around the way
You boogie down to my records almost every day
Go a hundred miles an hour when youre standin still
Youre faster than my Caddy when its goin downhill
Wont forget that day in the YMCA

For you to come inside cause he knew youd stay

I once knew this kid who was caught up in the game how 
His wallet and his chain was the promise in his brain
20 inch speakers amps got his wattage and his range
Smooth operator player rockin with the caine
Fiends hollerin his name go Lo got his product in they veins go Lo 
He said Livin clean only get you simple things
So he balanced triple beams now the block is feelin flames
Hot enough to make the Devil cop a lemonade
Cops poppin out a shade now the spot is gettin Raid
Like roaches night approach us gotta get away
Quicksand snitch ran to the cops to give his name
Picture his wife and kids not up in the frames
Stay dry get wet the only options in the rain drippin 
Impossible to maintain momma so ashamed
Good Lord granddaddy probably tossin in his grave
fades out halfway
Yeahhh boy
What goes up must come down
Dont believe the hype knahmsayin
chuckling Here we go again
You get caught up in that everyday cycle you might go psycho
Especially if you dont know what I know
My chords on the vinyl give you more than recital
And every situation we adapt for survival
The fittest exercise mind body spirit
For the first place category mandatory finish
Cause only the strong get it my lungs longwinded
In this race we call livin cant fall victim
To the same old excuses why not 
That only mean your brain goin useless
We make a change for improvement
Every plan needs an execution
Every man needs an evolution
Oppressed lands need a revolution
The best solution for the problems in place
Empires fell flat on they face due to the change
You think it strange my granddaddy would say
That butterfly was a caterpillar back in the day okay 
We used to flock together birds of the same feather
Shared the same clothes same hoes same treasure
When everything was fair everybody gained pleasure
But everything changed when came the rain weather
Whatever for unexpected shit like that
I keep an umbrella just in case it get like that
You was the cat who used to smile up in my face
Come up in my place in the fridgerator stuffin your face
Stuck in your ways somethin was strange
I shoulda known you was nothin but snake
The way you used to rattle on about yourself
It was all about you what could I do
I was just like nah I was nothin like you
See I was real you was the cat that used to front
First time you did that shit behind my back so what
Second time I had a problem with yourself hold up
Third time we had to talk I was like WHAT THE FUCK
Is this It used to be a friendship
Then this Decepticon transformed into a Benedict
I cant think of no other reason
Other than the fact that you was jealous of the life that I was leadin
Tryin to deceive me you only deceive you
What you thought was invisible was only seethrough
I used to love you like you came out my own mother
But the man behind the mask could never be my brother

6873,"Straight Outta Compton Extended Mix Lyrics
Niggas Wit Attitudes
Niggas Wit Attitudes
Niggas Wit Attitudes
Im comin straight outta Compton
When somethin happens in South Central Los Angeles
Nothin happens Its just another nigga dead dead 
Straight outta Compton crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When Im called off I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass thats how Im goin out
For the punk motherfuckers thats showin out
Niggas start to mumble they wanna rumble
Mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat thats pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Aint no tellin when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep you dancin
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK47 is the tool
Dont make me act the motherfuckin fool
Me you can go toe to toe no maybe
Im knockin niggas out the box daily
Yo weekly monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That Im down with the capital CPT
Boy you cant fuck with me
So when Im in your neighbourhood you better duck
Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave believe Im stompin
But when I come back boy Im comin straight outta Compton
Yall aoh aoh
City of Compton
City of Compton
Yo Ren
Whats up
Tell them where you from
Straight outta Compton another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke yo my rep gets bigger
Im a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggas wont show this
But I dont give a fuck Ima make my snaps
If not from the records from jackin the crops
Just like burglary the definition is jackin
And when Im illegally armed its called packin
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy I go up in it
So if youre at a show in the front row
Ima call you a bitch or dirtyass ho
Youll probably get mad like them bitches are posed to
But that shows me slut youre composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit cause Im tearin up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and thats a law
REN spells Ren but Im raw
See cause Im the motherfuckin Villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killin
Thats takin place without a clue
And once youre on the scope your ass is through
Look you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip
Straight outta Compton
City of Compton
City of Compton
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton is a brother thatll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont give a fuck thats the problem
I see a motherfuckin cop I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see a punk pass I smile
To me its kind of funny the attitudes showin a nigga drivin
But dont know where the fuck he goin just rollin
Lookin for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload you see its about to over the hesitation
And hears the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and Im jettin
But leave a memory no onell be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot Fuck her
You think I give a damn about a bitch I aint a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E and if you ever fuck with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
Word to the motherfucker straight outta Compton
City of Compton
City of Compton

5667,"I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
I just destroyed another phony ass rapper again
She wasnt causin it
She must be stupid as a fiend
They should have told the child You dont step to the Queen
Perplexed and Im vexed cause everywhere I go
People be flexin expectin me to wanna flow
I dont play that the only way that
I would be playing is if I pay back
And run the playback so whatcha sayin
You dont wanna be a sista in the name of rap
And yet you wanna talk shit and your style is wack
I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead
But now Im fed so its off with your head
Now
The moral of the verse is your career is through
And dont be fuckin with nobody who aint fuckin with you
If I was in yo shoes Id let the BS start walkin
Next time there might not be no talkin
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
A brotha pushed up on me at the movies one weekend
He was on a quest and I was who he was seekin
And although I am Black and he was a Puerto Rican
Aint make no diff to me so we continued to speak and
We hit it right off and everything was on a roll
Before I knew it I fell in love with his soul
Aye papi Aye Was the cry as he made love to me
I was freaked by the way he used to do me
And then one day when I was washin our clothes
A number fell outta his pocket and her name was Rose
A girls number Hmmm That struck me kinda funny
I lost my grip I had to call up the honey
There was a chick on the side Oh no it couldnt be
There was a chick on the side Hes down with OPP
I gave you the whole shabang
Just to find another woman hittin my thang
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand
Its got me goin crazy things are goin crazy 
Why the negative vibes And why do people take bribes
I dont understand it yo I dont know 
Why do bad people live And why do good people die
Somebody gotta tell me why  I dont know 
Why do people smoke crack And why do White fight Black
Whats that scenario  I dont know 
Why do hearts get broken Why the chumps get choked
They know I aint no joke  I dont know 
Now with the drums to the bass to the piano to the horn
Its a crazy ass life and thats my word its bond
Im tryin to be as logical as I possibly can
But for the life of me you know I just cant understand
Whats goin on sometimes
So situations like this come out in my rhymes
But Queen Latifah aint gone just yet
Cause when it comes to masterin confusion Im a VET
I cant understand I cant understand
I cant understand I cant understand

Who thought wed see the day when wed kick our feet up
Lay back exhale put the heat up

Only case we catching now would be a misdemeanor
Remember we used to hustle thinking life would cheat us
Not knowing if we struggled life would treat us
Think on how mommy carried us
Where life gon lead us
Knowing if we getting married
Our wife will need us
If at one time you could look into my mind
When I close my eyes and remember them times
No gas had a hot plate heat our dinners
No cash most nights ate sleep for dinner

Only time our block got wet was when the sprinklers were on
Think about that time dawg that wasnt long
Now that we got kids think when we was born
Coming up in my hood was hard
Every day my mom cooked with lard
Fucked up I couldnt feed myself
Living life no means of wealth
Eating shit I cant believe myself
Thats not a joke
Man I was dealt these cards and I played dem out
Yeah the road was rough but I made a route
Now picture running extension cords from your neighbors house
To get lights fuck Max on the latest routes
Used to close my eyes try to fade it out
Dumb niggas in the hood think I made it out
Man that showed me just where they mental at
And tell me half of these cats aint been through jack

3088,"Goodbye Englands rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along Englands greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness weve lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch well always carry
For our nations golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along Englands greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Goodbye Englands rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye Englands rose
From a country lost without your soul
Wholl miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no one else

Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost this cant be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm now I will just say goodbye

Youll never have no wins here
You got no friends here
Your heart pumps fear I know youve been scared
Im prepared
To face the pressure when I put it on ya
Blame your peoples yall
Somebody should have warned ya
That the day would come
When the truth would certify your lies
Nigga be dickriders its like undercovers wearing wires
Wanna infiltrate
Wanna know what makes the god tick
My voice is crucial to the track
Like the snare and hard kick
Each bar is sick I spit phlegm in the form of gems
Listen how I glisten watch the storm begin
Harsh winds and then will come the downpour
Succas be faking Jacks dont know what theyre down for
I pop your dome with high incantation
Your feeble ass brain still enslaved like on a plantation
Like Frederick Douglass I be the abolitionist
Breaking your chains a modern revolutionist
Too many tears of sorrow too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available too few schools equipped
Too few role models so behold the revolutionist
Too many tears of sorrow too many years of struggle
Too many drops of blood too many problems to juggle
Too few jobs available too few schools equipped
Too few role models so behold the revolutionist
Go ahead 
The revolutionist I blessed refuse to kiss ass
Quit fast Im wearing the mask cause of my tormented past
Swallow the pain follow the mental terrain
It takes a hell of nowadays to maintain
bloodstain
Face bruised and eyes reflect agony
Of dreams that were shattered it never mattered
To the socalled general public
About my nations situation
And how we rise above it and they love it
When we selfdestruct and kill our home
And the grade of responsability yes is still our own
We should know by now
That the systems designed for our demise
If we are wise well be left behind
The dollar size rule but what about the fool
Who falls victim to the material world
Yo pick the jewel I cant see myself
All my fame in that type of gem
The rebel the militant yeah Im not that type of man
Worldwide famine poor people demanded
That somebody do something soon
And lets examine the facts
Behind the violent acts behind the daily gunplay
The cocaine and the crack
Thug season
Thats the reason for the trees and everybody wants to eat
Some gotta resort the faithin believin
That the hustling help em get by
Well for anyone that gets over
Another hundred will die
What has to come Will my heart grow numb 
How will I save the world By using my mind like a gun
Seems a better weapon cause everybody got heat
I know I carry mine since the last time I got beat
Aint nothing sweet
I turn a stickup kid to a soldier put him down with the cause
Make him feel real bold and more intelligent
Plus aware of the tricknology the revolutionist
Grab your shit and follow me

Play with yourself in the shower Ill be jerkin off while you gone
Stick my tongue in your ass to fight your arm
Strawberries on your clit thats the bomb
Baby all dick in my palm
Cock your ass up and remain calm
Penetrate where you fight it
Pull your panties to the side you like it

Hair on your pussy dont hide it

Plane flights fuckin you in midair on United
Your Gstrings is wet Im delighted
Girl would you fuck tonight
Suck the dick let me lick the clit
Watch you piss in the toilet bowl
I get freaky watch you drink milk with diapers on
Lick around the cat bowl
Pull out couch unfold pierced belly button
With black leather boots you showin me your asshole
Lubrication grease and Pentax camera
You sold all my stamina
The way I house see
I lick your pussy from the back on the balcony
Witcha girlfriends surroundin me watchin VHS with me
Suckin your breasts your secret fantasy
Is to suck my dick in the pickup truck and have sex
While you bump your CD by Next
I rub my hand and face and smear sperm in your chest
Spread your legs wide I see the pink in your pussy flesh
Open it down South wipe my cum from around your mouth
Watch my testicles regurgitate
Fuck your girlfriend I put fingers in her ass she like to hate
You trust me put on your lingerie and have faith
Condom on my dick lets be safe

Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away cross the sea
Its been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh let me think let me think
What shall I do
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no
Remember walking in the sand
Remember walking hand in hand
Remember the night was so exciting
Remember her smile was so inviting
Remember then she touched my cheek
Remember with her fingertips
Remember softly
Softly we met with a kiss
Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew
The girl that said shed been true
Oh whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you
What will I do with it now

7060,"Yeah one for the treble two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you wanna keep pace
Oh No
Niggas aint scared to hustle
Its been 7 days the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Say my name say my name
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and paved my game
My own two raise my flame cause dickridin aint my thang
I earned what they said I wouldnt
I got it the way they said I couldnt
But now Im gettin it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad cause Im gettin caked out from my bookings
When yall was askin permission I just stepped up and took it
What The kids better buy my rookie card now
Cause after this year the price aint comin down
And if you got a joint bubblin then get money now
Cause in a minute theres gonna be some real trouble comin out
Just a warnin as usual some cats wont heed it
The hardheaded always gotta feel it to believe it
Its a shame they jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent or dirty like the 71 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin
You keep on schemin man gimme some more reason
To have the women in your mamas church screamin Lord Jesus
Harder than yall cause Im smarter than yall
I know that deep down its gotta be botherin yall
Pay attention watch Flaco get larger than yall
Pour your pride on the rocks and make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for yall it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The doordie stay rumblin and bubblin hard
And when we move we aint got no discussion at all
East Coasts on your neck and you aint shruggin it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumblin off
Im Daddy Brooklyn yall niggas are the sons of New York
Gettin spanked when its too much trouble to talk
Respect mine
Oh No
Look at who they let in the back do
From Long Beach to Brooklyn they know
We rock from the East to West Coast
Queens salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness Pharoahes raps are blazin
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go twoways without Skytel pagers
Im intellectual pass more essaysess
Than motorcade police parades through East LA
More beef then delis thus what I vent is just Uh 
What you lust to vent its irrele
Huh hallelujah Pharoahe Monchll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind screw ya
Get the picture sit ya seat ya greet ya with scriptures
Im equipped to rip ya reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leavin you mentally unfocused here
MCs just come on round
Youre the next contestants on CatchABeatDown
Dont be hesitant sound cracks the sediment
Its evident we medicine for your whole town
Skys the limit games infinite when Im in it
All windows is tinted how you seein me when Im in it
Rap we got it on lock man stop that
Put that mic back down boy drop that
Pharoahes flows blows shows like Afros
We hate yall though thats why Nate Dogg go

With the choice of a lady

3374,"I have witnessed your death
Ive seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrepit little mind
A fathers son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die again for Him
God wont touch what Ive done
He cries upon my feet
A privileged pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged in fear
Await the coming of the God
I will watch you die again for Him
Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquer divide within
Terrorize the mind
Ive seen the end its yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh it melts
Spilling from the sky
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die
This is Gods war
Gods war
This is Gods war
Gods war
War of holy principles
Im seeking Gods help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heathen man
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead
Fuck your God erase his name
A lady weeps insane with sorrow
Ill take his towers from the world
Youre fuckin raped upon your deathbed
This is Gods war
Gods war
This is Gods war
Gods war
Fucking holy war
Be optimistic happy and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors
Your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For its a point of no return for Almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servants
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy
The great Satan

6226,"What can I do
What can I do to make it better
Yeah yeah
I thank the Lord for every morning he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining theres a cloud in the sky
Lettin me know that at any moment there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is there still can be pain
Down the park I hear the sirens just a screamin away
And then the inevitable happens the end of them days
As sad as it sounds but thats the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth will taketh away will taketh away 
I live and I learn I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer cause eventually Ill stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest
Do you hear them crying
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears someone like you and me 
Take away their fears
And then a child is born
Bloody naked clingin to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams babys alive 
At the same time another mother murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
Its hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith and killin your pearls
And sometimes I sit it down and wonder myself
But then again I aint Jesus and I couldnt help
All I can do is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds cause dealin with that
Would be the hardest thing Id ever have to do in my time
Id have to take my own life too and I couldnt climb
The stairway that you hear me singin bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin his kid aint decidin the time
I know its truth the next day we just livin to die
But I believe if you livin right youll live in the sky
Lookin down on the good and the bad the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did before you had to go
Do you hear them crying
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
someone to dry their tears Take away their fears
Can I make it better I want to make it better 
Can I ease the pain that they are goin through theyre through 
What can I do
What can I do
I say goodbye to you cruel world I see peace in the red sky
I see the beast when the dead die relief when my heads high
Hear the streets up ahead cry when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Does that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb but Im cool Im cool
Kelly Price 
Do you hear me
Im cryin
Do you hear them crying x2 to fade 
Waiting for someone to come and dry their tears
someone to dry their tears 
Take away their fears take away their fears 
Can I make it better gonna make it better 
Can I ease the pain that they are goin through

I promise Id never leave you ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees my prototype for every
My share of deeds and RIPs
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen Look over your shoulder 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Im posed to shine remind Im king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros the cons the diamond rings
Im full with time but Ima bring
The soul divine and cross between
Whats yours and mines the gold the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals Scream 
For hiphop look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks baby you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over its love
I know ya Woo 
Dont you know baby
Dont you know baby
Just look over your shoulders honey
Whenever you need me
Just look Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders honey
Yeah yeah you need me Woo 
Shhh look over your shoulder get me
Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes I see the game is a little different niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit em like darts til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it dont matter how much you gon try to convince me
And you gon make my gun cock and talk a whole nother way yo
Woahohohohoh Woo 
I am the Buddha the Ali Baba the believerer maker
So pristine the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake em
So rude Im so ice cold but Im what you need to just wake em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin for me to just take em
When I arrive my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave even my shadow got a sound to it
Cause Im the god of the harder the martyr the father
I spit a saliva thats leaking a lava
Completin the saga while meetin and greetin
And beating you niggas completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga believe me
Graffiti your armor you heebie you jeebie
Bikini your broad up You guinea pig 
See me now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak have a seat it was deep
I was sleep now the gods up hmm
Upholding the fundamentals while most of you boast a rental
Focus on whats most essential spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder Woo 
Dont you know baby Ooh woah

7677,"Raw Remix Lyrics
Here it comes
Since the faroff days when man first heard a scratchy noise
On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones
It has been his aim to add breadth and depth to give realism
And spaciousness and even where it applies to convey actual movement
Intro I start to go my rhymesll flow
So get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you were lounging around its time to get up
Pardon my expression but Imma tear shit up
I appear right here and scare and dare a mere musketeer
That would dare to compare I do declare
Getting busy is where its at
But what youre saying you wouldnt get a point for that
Cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat
You say youre rocking how many shows you get
All your vocals go local on the MIC
Mines go a great distance like ATT
Im not new to this Im true to this nothing you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So yo go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse
Get you a nurse too late get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct I get respect Im out to collect
Cash money cause I get raw
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Boy do I hate a
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Here I am RAW
A terrorist here to bring trouble to
Phony MCs I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause Im at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter Im a kilo
Second to none making MCs run
So dont try to step to me cause I aint the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it so I dont see why you all
Try to front perpetrating a stunt
When you know that Ill smoke you up like a blunt
Im genuine like Gucci raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the AM
Ill make a muscle grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed I bust a
Little rhyme with authority superiority
And captivate the whole crowds majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
Im sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Give a speech like a reverend rappers start severing
And in my lifetime believe Ive never been
Beaten or eaten and just tooken out
You know come to think about it I keep MCs looking out
And real nervous when Im at your service
Give me that title boy you dont deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme you know that it has to
Be perfectly fitted cause Im committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kanell get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know
I damage ya Im not an amateur but a pro
fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
So full of action my name should be a verb
My voice will float on every note
When I clear my throat thats all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe its gonna be smooth sailing so on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get them in a battle and make them all history
Ruling and schooling MCs that Im dueling
Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling
On my throne with a bronze microphone
Hmm God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause I get raw
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Heres an experiment to begin with
Twentyfour sev chilling killing like a villain
The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust coming off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
Only crushing MCs that be trying to riff
I get strong and titanic do work like a mechanic
Make MCs panic they all get frantic
And skeptic like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rock but hey what you expected
Ill get raw for you just like a warrior
Rapping like a samurai and Ill be damned if I
Ever let a FisherPrice MC hang
Their rhymes are toy nothing but yinyang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And Imma preach your funeral
Tell me who in the world could ever come with more
I get raw

Im twentytwo now but I wont be for long
Time hurries on

I held her close but she faded in the night

And watched the ripples run away

It wont matter baby
Dont you know
Dont you know
Woah dont you baby hey
It wont matter baby
Dont you know
Dont you know
Uh make it out the hood they say you Hollywood
How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good
Gotta check and treat these niggas like Im Robin Hood
When it was time to stand up for me see nobody stood
And I was lookin at you niggas all the ones I fed
Had me grindin all them nights when you was going to bed
And if you think I owe you something nigga gon ahead
Treat you like I never knew you put it on your head
And I got Papi on my line like When you comin home
My mama see it in my face she know that somethin wrong
Bodies droppin in my city all summer long
Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin on
Cause I cant let em take my life you might get left you make that right
When he got left it wasnt right but he was tryna live that life
I call up Coon to book that jet we like three deep we take that flight
Used to land in California to play that studio all night we stayin down
For the love of them millions aint layin down
Left you in the hood what you sayin now
And niggas wanted the smoke you said Stand down uh
Cold heart never get cold feet when the pressure come
It was beef I had to tell niggas You better come
Sister said they gettin over its like you lettin them
Some shit I had to learn my lesson from uh
Checkin in checkin out I just had to check you out
2012 it was 50 niggas when Im steppin out
Forgot the time you asked me for a check and I aint lend it out
I aint even know you was upset thats what this shit about
A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater
When you cant bring up one time you returned me for a favor
So I pray these niggas real close talkin closer than my neighbors
Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides catch them vapors
Used to be my dawg you was in my left titty
Scream Ride or die I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous you wouldnt even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
Used to be my dawg you was in my left titty
Scream Ride or die I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous you wouldnt even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
See I look at it like this
What Im supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio rappin my lights out
Goin city to city cant take my son to school when I want to cant see my mama my family when I want to
They give a nigga my money then act like he hangin with me
I aint never been sweet
Far as I can remember every time I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself
I aint never even think about a nigga callin my baby mama to pick my son up to take him to the movies
Go play basketball while Im doin this time in the cell
Actin like I owe you somethin
See it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me about that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master on the front of that shit
I used to hear niggas niggas that I was feedin I heard em whisperin Meek Mill finished
I was like And damn I was feedin you bro
All I did was keep grindin
Through the storm nigga Im like Derrick Rose on a 50point night on a daily basis nigga
For the love of the millions royalty over loyalty never get it confused
I got real friends and family thatll never turn their back on me for the love of the money
I got a homie thats doin lifehe cant offer me no money he cant offer me nothin but a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So dont come to me talkin bout no money shit nigga
So if you feel some type of way about my money we goin to the furthest extent to protect that plate that goes in front of my son on the table nigga
One love to all my family and friends that stayed down through all the madness
While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line
One time for my mom and sister that never changed on me even before I had money
Ride or die no matter what
Dreamchasers for life you dig
Uh I told niggas stop askin me where niggas at
If you dont see em in the pictures with me that mean they faded away
I got niggas I distanced myself from we love each other its all love but everybody cant make it
Niggas wanna burn a bridge and expect you to send a yacht huh Where they do that at

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will its just a question of when
Ive lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that wont happen to us
Cause its always been a matter of trust
I know youre an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
But I cant offer you proof
But youre gonna face a moment of truth
Its hard when youre always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
Its a matter of trust
You cant go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for Gods sake dont shut me out
This time youve got nothing to lose
You can take it you can leave it whatever you choose
I wont hold back anything
And Ill walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
Its make believe until its only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust
Im sure youre aware love
Weve both had our share of
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong
Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After youve heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart

Faith in God high thinking and simple living
Work hard deep love no conditions
Gentle heart head level clear vision
Back tall firm in our conviction
Smile through the tears laugh through the tragedy
All we got is each other must love radically
Passionately peaceful fight for it fanatically
Premium on people magic humanity
Dance as if no ones looking sing like no ones listening
Live and love out loud and let your spirit glisten
Feet firm in the dirt head in the sky
Serve when the sun is at work dream when he hides
And know that the water that well up in your eye
Is the same when a loved one is born as when they die
As sure as every hello is eventually goodbye
The art of truly living is learning how to die
Wherever you go
May the good lord bless your heart and soul
My beloved my beloved my beloved
I want you to know
That your love and your wisdom touched me so
My beloved my beloved my beloved
Bless your soul so precious and delicate
Powerfully compassionate your friendship
Held me together when the threat of unraveling
Had me at the brink feeling inadequate
When the sky got dreary my eyes got teary my
Heart got weary you were right there near me
Only reason I aint laid up in some cemetery
Is when I was in fear somebody cared enough to hear me
Anything that I do in this life of mine
From this point is part you for the gifts you provide
Only way to repay you is live right and shine
Trust me when I tell you youre still on my mind
Wherever you go
May the good lord bless your heart and soul
My beloved my beloved my beloved
I want you to know
That your love and your wisdom touched me so
My beloved my beloved my beloved
Young lovers passion in their stare
Hanging in the air challenging their fears
Catch a passing moment and grab it in the clear
Desperately attempting to stretch it into years
Her soft and elegant he firm and gallant
Words dancing between them hanging in the balance
Grins and glances translate every sentence
Into a language where the future smiles at us
Loves not careful neither is it fearful
The thought of living without is unbearable
So listen young lady this me thanking you
No matter what you will always have my gratitude
Wherever you go

But I know Ive said the same about them all
We received our education

Almost busted in Laredo
But for reasons that Id rather not disclose
But if youre staying in a motel there and leave
Just dont leave nothing in your clothes

They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious

Remix check it out
Bboy where the fuck you at
I been looking for youre ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter baby come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer thats when you had enougha
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
Youre getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby down this Mimosa
You better believe its time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade too bad to be played
Get vexed and Im bound to throw shade
All over your body
Whos body your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life aint all that unless youre doing it right
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Beware of the stare when I step the piece
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
Ayes I can can or why not
If I wanna yes I can can
More honey than a bumblebee hive
Pulling sixtynine ways out my archive
Sweet like licorice sugar for my booga
Juicy like HiC or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I aint afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Ven aqui and Ill get rid of all company
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didnt perform well
They gets no answer when they ringaringa my bell
Youre playing with my time trying to jerk me
Hurt me then desert me you better work me
While you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the LYTE
Only the strong survive only the wise excel
Once said by my borninhell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info of my sheets in the streets
Cause that aint cool and that aint cute
To talk about who knocked the boot on a video shoot
But its all good though you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey make your move and hop up on it
Its natural never be ashamed
Fuck the fame get the name and kick the game
All you gotta do is Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Keep on keepin on
Its the remix uh
Yes baby uh
Ya dont stop
It goes on and on and ya dont stop
Just keep it on
Keep on keepin on
Uh yes yes yall
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new

2229,"The Sad Caf Lyrics
Out in the shiny night the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Caf
Oh it seemed like a holy place protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like love and freedom
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Caf
Oh expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by
Some of their dreams came true some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind inside the Sad Caf
Acoustic Solo
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train it dont stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I dont know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Caf
Why dont you meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Caf
Saxophone Solo

6993,"I couldnt help but notice your pain
My pain
It runs deep share it with me
Theyll never take me alive Im gettin high with my fourfive
Cocked on these suckas time to die
Even as a youngster causin ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin up dust
But now Im labeled as a troublemaker who can you blame
Smokin weed helped me take away the pain
So Im hopeless rollin down the freeway swervin dont worry
Im bout to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me what should I do
I had to feed my fuckin family what else could I do
But be a thug Out slangin with the homies
Fuck hangin with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger never been a stranger to homicide
My citys full of gangbangers and drivebys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse mind full of sick thoughts
And I aint goin back to court so fuck what you thought
Im drinkin Hennessy runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be 23 Theres so much pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Years and years of that rough life
Runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife
And livin trifed on the regular buckin out competitors
See em fake a move and chase em down like the fuckin Predator
Get in trouble every day in school act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin off for the bitches cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop pop pop and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo currency kept passin me by but I didnt cry broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin coke
And now the moneys lookin lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick em the game its all the same
I kick it back yo give em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman you heard man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn At least Im realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo ass twisted so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan kickin major dust
So if you owe nigga look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame its a deep game
And my mama always cryin yo theres so much pain
Ohhhh
So tired so tired
Ohhhh
Soso
They got me mobbin like Im loced and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I aint scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck cause I aint lookin when Im bblastin
Im a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Dont wanna die tell me why Cause this stress is gettin major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until Im dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
Im real they cannot see and every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin on the streets and Ill be ballin loc
Dont let em make you worry keep swingin at these suckas til you buried
I was born to raise hell a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother Im touched
Out kickin dust up ready to bust
Im on the scene steady muggin mean until they kill me
Ill be livin this life I know you feel me theres so much pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

I find it hard to say
That everything is alright
Dont look at me that way
Like everything is alright
Cause my own eyes can see
Through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see
Is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap
And easy to be wasted
As history repeats
So foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say
Against these laws of man
Cause like the Bible says
His blood is on their hands
And what I gotta say
And what I gotta say is rebel
While today is still today choose well
And what I gotta say is rebel
It cant go down this way
Choose well choose well choose well
Choose well choose well choose well
And while the people sleep

Shes something like a super freak
I never seen her on tape before
But when she go low shes a professional
My kinda girl
Porno star
Shes something like a super freak
Never seen her on tape before
But when she go low shes a professional
Around the Carolina hood see most niggas called her ho and diss her
Cuz shes slowly growing up to be like her older sister
She got a bad reputation so you dont hold and kiss her
And after one conversation youd probly fold in twister
It aint hard to tell that honeys dumb
Shes 18 goin on 21
Mama dont know where she get her money from
Hoppin in the naughty cars
Stuffed in the backseat
Lookin to score big
Cuz she fucks all the athletes
Somethin like a princess gon wrong
Used to be a ballerina
Now she performs to The Thong Song
Happily had plans to enroll in college
Now youd rather slide down metal poles for dollas
Your fingernails and your toes is polished
But your brains on freeze
In other words frozen knowledge
All your plans and your goals demolished
You grew up in Southside
Why niggas know you a ho in Hollis huh
I still remember how it all started
School cuttin from class
Every boy you knew touching yo ass
Headed no where fast
I aint gon lie
Shorty I used to laugh
Cuz you was the main topic on math
I seen her in the mall shoppin
Im contemplating bout stoppin
Cuz she could get me off like Cochran
Now that dinner was poppin
Spoiled her daddy was pumpin
He probly thought shed grow up to get married or somethin
But little did he know
His little princess was a city ho
Pretty ooh the face
Tight from the video
Damn this bitch is thick
She on the Lil Kim shit
See her hair match the color of her lipstick
Now this chick claimed to love jewelry like Slick Rick
And had a walk on her that would leave you with a stiff dick
Jeans had a sick fit
To make a long story short
This aint the type a bitch you wanna stick with

We can freak it out wut we can freak it out
Verse 1 NoreagaKurupt
You gone thug it out gangsta style
Nigga check it out
Ayyo my baby moms hunny let me see my child
Niggas see me in the streets ask why i dont smile
Thats why nigga because my life is a mess
And Im sellin records now but i still feel stress
Neva had a legal job all i sold was drugs
And I still got my moms and the rest of my thugs
But my pops he aint here does that seem so foul
And im drinkin everyday on the wrong route
And cant wait for the day when Capone come out
No doubt my MU niggas thuggin it out
To wut wut all my niggas just funk wit Kurupt
Tell then niggas where they stand at where they end up wut

Rip a sic sumthin my dick a stick sumthin
Just try me see the new millineum came

Daminican ten are gone poetical pentagon
Nuttin silenced they all are violenced
The law story wars over territory
The masses only left Kurupt and Nore
Known to spit brimstone fire and magma
Wit magnums and mosts many and mostly semis
I pays no rent cars wit no lease
Got eight killas wit badges I pay police
Its a freak fest east to west no more wars
Bomb girls feastless nude beaches and nude shores
Baby soft as peaches soft as a plum
Aint no fun if the homies cant have none

6378,"Yo while we hold gats you hold knives
And when you sold eighths we sold pies
And when you rode bikes we drove 5s
Theres no comparison son sjust embarrasing
Im runnin wit some of da baddest men in the whole New York
We hold the fort while you crab cats is holdin tips
Playa hatin pushin stolen whips
We at da dice game rollin trips out of town throwin bricks
Taking over cooking up coke with baking soda
I buy hot jewels and ice it down while you go to the jewellery store wit short doe tryna bring the prices down
You betta spread wit them 30 dollar kicks on
Or get whipped on knocked out cold and pissed on
L is a heavyweighter wit steady paper
You da type to go to jail for a petty caper
Then come home on good behavior
Talkin bout you no longer hard now cause you a man of god now
Yo its amazing L is blazing always been
Before i put da braids in i use to let the waves spin
What you be saying dont impress me at all
And them chicks u be jayin dont be sexy at all

Go head and front so i can try this right hand out
Across yo jaw L neva lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce tha law
You got sumthin to say then cough it out
Cuz cowards be wantin beef but when u pull out the heat
They ready to talk it out

Yall fellas like to stress them chicks impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks i sex them chicks
Then send them home corleone is known to be stoned
When i bone i rubber duck in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the grey BM went to the ATM
Took a thou out later on i had to wild out
In da club knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom pissed Cristal out
Now im thinkin what chick number i can dial out
Cuz its L the harlem pimp baby for real
I got more dimes then that sprint lady and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks but im tryna sell records like Garth Brooks
So f em all when its cold i throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on mega ice is what im heavy on
If it aint Cristal boo i guess its Prignon
If the nanas too tight i throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the 9 mil burst
Ive been off the scene over 3 years and cats is still thirst
They hear Big L drop a ill verse so all you unsigned cats that wanna battle get a deal first

For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt
Digging ditches for the chain gang sleeping in the cold

6507,"Yeah twenty miles an hour in my long Bentley
Shame on you hater this what the Lord sent me
Shit lately Ive been practicing my gas face
Cause thats what Ima give em when they land in last place
Hand right by the hammer aint too many seein Santa
So they wanna take my gifts but I wrap em with the fif
My regular scent is piff currency and Cashmere
You done drove your bitch away I told her she can crash here
Yeah Im counting paper like the cashier
Living like Im limited breathing like its my last air
My boy in and out the box super stupid soldier
Told me if he could do it again hed do it over
Povertys king cobra squeeze your life out
Cause its the fatalities and causalities I should write bout
These rappers aint iced out they just fooling niggas
Running round town fakers zirconian cubic niggas
Only money matters in the game fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs feed my hunger pain
Music like heroin leave you numb the same
Play me like Im something sweet be apart of summer slaying
Most hate it most doubt it thats what they shouted
Im on top now theres nothing they can do about it
Yall better have yall guns
Cause walking where Im from there aint no way around it
Home sweet home
You motherfuckers can rap til you blue in the face
Youll probably turn into smurfs with the time that you waste
Throughout history they thrown shots at the greats
But I shoot back the Lord aint designed me for hate
Ive never understood Martin Luther with the speech
With the whole world watching me turn the other cheek
Never so theres one left to die in the streets
Cause his long arms happen to connect with his reach
Try to kill you then them near misses was Gods kisses
True Hollywood Story ghetto Todd Bridges
Diffrent Strokes that nigga broke this nigga rich
You only read about the cars that I paddle shift
You only dream about the hoes that I dabble with
Balcony views like a postcard imagine this
White stones black steel cold chrome
This citys my doormat bitch Im home sweet home
Only money matters in the game fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs feed my hunger pain
Music like heroin leave you numb the same
Play me like Im something sweet be apart of summer slaying
Most hate it most doubt it thats what they shouted
Im on top now theres nothing they can do about it
Yall better have yall guns
Cause walking where Im from there aint no way around it
Home sweet home
Niggas see me where you see me shit Im always seen
Off the Queens magazines pissy hallway scenes
Paying crowds hunger screams pressure crumbles teams
Fuck being humble in the jungle where they fumble dreams
Drugs for the living Henny payment for the body
Crosses for the power ghetto bitches for the smiley
Pitbull I bit my way out the cage whats happening
Competition got me on the Rampage Jackson
Part of my reaction to they corny ass raps
Keep flirting with death and get your horny ass clapped
Back for more me rat tat kiss the ring beat respect out them
Bloody heads turn Timberlands to red bottoms
Fifty bottles just a start now thats how you do it
Carbon fiber through the Spyder playing rider music
Aint no question of my resume I gotta prove it
Lifes a bitch and I get blowjobs reclinin through it
Only money matters in the game fuck the fame
I gotta eat dollar signs feed my hunger pain

4706,"Ladies and gentlemans
This an ode to the Bboys Bgirls
The people out there who do it for the love
And believe me Im not dissin anybody out there whos trying to get paid
Im trying to get paid too
But I got one question
Whatever happened to the heart
That pumped the passion into the art
The entity that gave you the energy to wanna start
Breakdancing Im battling doing it at the park
Where the mission was expression not only to top charts
I dont know what happened wanting to blow rap
You lose soul and passion for the flows and the tracks
Radios lacking controlled by fascists assholes doing damage
But were gonna take it back
Before beats to a hundred Gs a pop
All you needed was a tabletop and a beatbox
Hiphop without the Bboy is like shelltoes only having two stripes
Hiphop were freedomfighting graffitiwriting party types
That recite and organize and revitalize our rhyming
Til the group of the moneymakers systems
Knows that the industry can eventually get served
Breakers of my verses spinning up a revolution throughout our words
If you really want it come on get it cause Ive got it
Im honestly paying homage to forgotten pioneers of this culture that are giving them props and learn
If you wanna earn your stripes
You gotta be able to rock this mic and set cyphers alike
The feeling to put in everything you got in the circle
Will never be documented in the Coke commercial
We be the baddest
Now Bboys Bgirls
Bring it back to the block
Lemme see you get ill for real pop and lock
If you record without thought then stop
Because Ill serve your whole album with the goddamn beatbox
Without thought it just happens
If you gotta think to feel thats not rapping thats acting
Im from a land of backpacks and fat cats
MCs with sick raps who serve those that are wack
Its a way of life
I put all my energy into the melody
On the mp3s until the death of me
Record exceptionally especially
Whenever I be monumentally grammatically killing the mic
I tell my DJs cranking that music keeping em moving when the beat plays
Staying into it breaking and grooving and MCs they
Thinking that you should always pursue in what their dreams make
Taking from lucid to really do it
All the people gotta make their money
And the way to make money is to get inside of the industry
Take it on the radio flow
So you can go blow we get a car
And a crib up on MTV
But in the end whats classic
Radio bubblegum Or a voice filled with passion
To my real hiphop heads please stand up
Cause the only people that can preserve this art is us

5645,"Yo I met this girl the other night
Hype superdope body and face her miniskirt tight
Talkin bout legs and lips mindblowin hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told meI was the one
I said Why she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now thats the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said Fast slow hard or soft baby
She said All the above
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
Now I aint no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you she was on some motherfuckin sex trip
Took me to her crib that night leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobelight
And started buggin lightin candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
Yo my pants were on but so what
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkeyass up
Faster than I could say No
It was like a rodeo I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip I said Shit
This girl had crazy plans for the night
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
Now whips aint all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitchs pad
Im talking about latex suits spikeheeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said Dontdontdont whip me
Ill do anything you ask
And then homegirl stripped 38 tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin baby oil on her chest
And then she said Gimme gimme gimme
Jumped on my Jimmy and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin husband sixfoot ten
I knew my life would soon end
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didnt use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me
Yoyo nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didnt use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me
Cause he had caught me fuckin his wife

Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in
To Las Vegas chaos Casino Oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Let her know Im here if she ever need me to be with her
As long as she know I can never be with her
She asks you why I just need you to keep it G with her
Tell her I found a happiness that I could never see with her
Three years after that break up shouldve had closure by now
Wed be best friends youda let this end wed be closer by now
But you want us upset hostile angry evil jealous bitter shit
Fuck makin your bed and lyin in it
You bought the house live with it
I came to you for a second chance you gave me your ass to kiss
Found another salad to toss how the fuck is you mad at this
Oh I forgot you not in love anymore
And Id believe it but see Im not on drugs anymore
Thats based on action words I stopped believin still I hear it though
Would you save them if you knew they became meaningless to me years ago
But if happiness is the finish line I beat you there
So Karma must be real cause since we broke up he aint treat you fair
And were off to the races places
Ready set the gate is
Down and now were going in

Honey it is time to spin
Boy youre so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
Remember our bad breakup I rapped about it on Downfall
But you know I dont stay down for long
Remember you met that other dude
Whos smarter and more mature with more bread
That you thought would be around for long
Remember you pulled the rug from under me left me to be alone
I threatened suicide begged was crazy about you
But that stalker dude was deranged
To the point you wished death on his name
And when we speak now you still say Im crazy without you
My my how the tables have turned
Or are they bendin just a little You resent it just a little
Cause dude that ruined your life made you doubt yours
Its the reason that loneliness you gave me is now yours
Check it in perspective I cant even call it hatin
You mad at the situation really it aint even Kaylin
We both sympathized that pain is felt and shared
To watch a man that you helped better display it elsewhere
Watch a man you spent years with grew with
Come across as someone that you want nothin to do with
To sleep in a bed with what ifs instead of somethin special
How can you get over us The public wont even let you
I know to wake up with that fear is gross
Love me from far cause you scared to get close
But what are you fearin the most
If happiness is the finish line I beat you there
I always thought that when youd put the baggage down Id meet you there
And were off to the races places

Now a nigga ballin you still tell me to grow some
Entertainin threesomes you dont think that its wholesome
Say that you cant trust me think Im out here trashin you
Got a lot of answers to questions I dont be askin you
I tried to be friends so I dont see a problem passin through
You welcome a nigga then paint it as me harassin you
You must be misconstruin my love and its gassin you
Causin you to wear our shit out and think its fashionable
Im thinkin you should put our history in back of you
That would call for you steppin outside of yourself and bein rational
Come to friendship you question me in that capacity
How would you ever know
Its not somethin you ever asked of me
And VH1 just gave us another episode
So maybe its smart that you cant let this go
Cause love changes a thug changes
And soulmates become strangers word up

7450,"TKO Black Friday Remix Lyrics
I dont understand it
Tell me how could you be so low
And all in thrilling new living sound 
Dammit babe
Dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe 
Blood thicker than water right
Fuck bitches they all alike
Stand up nigga not the fallin type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called Control was on
The room got nearer the tune got clearer
Thats when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl what is that a ringtone
Shit not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what Imma do
Decisions decisions
In case this is war then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems my triggers on auto
Ill make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit you dont believe in me
I dont need you I got me bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree bitch
Two gold plaques I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on JayZ bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me bitch
You try to fuckin play me I ought to knock your ass out
TKO I dont understand it tell me how could you be so low damn take out 
Youve been swingin after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt through my chest perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
Dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe 
All hail Pretty Flacko bitch celebrate it
Had the game on lock streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated thats the devil aint it
Fuck that shit he rich fuck that shit he this fuck that shit he that
He black he dont like blacks fuck that shit he wack
Fuck that shit he raps fuck that shit he spits fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with finished talking shit Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses fuck surprises
Im monogamous and not to mention in my closet
Is a model chick grimey gothic fits trapped inside of it
Besides it Id deny the shit shit yall should stop the shit
Im the shit not just kinda sick the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it clickclick opposite stop and droppin shit
fore poppin shit from popular to poppin picks to poppin tits
She pop her pussy pop a Xanny popular for compliments
Make it rain she pop that shit it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic I hope God forgive you peep my common sense
TKO I dont understand it tell me how could you be so low
Youve been swingin after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt through my chest perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
Dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe 
JT this like deja vu right
All this album of the year talk niggas claimin theyre the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cubans poking my chest out
They keep callin on King Push this beach chair Im stretched out
My name is my name bitch until Im gone and its etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine I made her mind she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire even better Im a reallionaire
Alaa skirt Fendi work dress my baby like buildabear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie Fuck you know about blowin bands
Bezel on it like a grand circle diamonds in it holdin hands
A1 since day one I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and its so dope what I made from it
No lie know why Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime
She aint know we aint know try to trap her but she aint slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow its lights out TKO

With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Oh couldnt see to get a line on you my sweet honey love
Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you my sweet honey love
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
When youre drunk in the alley baby with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
Whoa just seemed too many flies on you
I just cant brush them off
Angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
Whoa thought I heard one sigh for you

Mister Mister Mister Mister Smith
You want a hit
Ugh 
Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
Yo
Im here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let my balls hang like Im on a toilet taking a shit
My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip Drip 
Fuck all that sensuous shit Drip 
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your clique holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If your if was a spliff wed be all fucked up Word up 
No need to ask you Who is he Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard on many rough cities
Chicago LA any of em Ill have to Norman Bate you Yeah 
I love ta hate you cause yous a freak by nature
Cant wait to face ya mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight with no chaser Word up 
My verbal combats like a miniMac to your back Uhhuh 
As soon as one of you niggas try to overreact Blaow 
The LOD love good confrontation or vamp Word up 
Break your concentration murder your camp Haha 
For the jealous overzealous we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis Bombombom bombombom 
Niggas coming through and acting wild Word 
Yall commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile
I shot ya
I conversate with many men What its time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew ayo you hear me friend
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Secret society trying to keep they eye on me Nah nah 
But Ima stay incogni in places they cant find me
Make my moves strategically the GOD
Its sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real What 
Yeah you motherfucking right kid you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin title read
You get backslapped so hard make ya nose bleed Ahh 
Some def kids feeling guilty bout the space shit
The truth hurts baby girl so just face it Alright 
But anyway back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing Kid 
Everything is real not just a song that we sing Word up 
From my life to the paper What very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will SHINE Shine baby shine shine yeah 
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me What 
Without acknowledging this man as GOD
I shot your faggot ass
Ugh now who the fuck you think you talking to

Look Im Joey Crack motherfuckers be like Hes bad news
Runnin this racket from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
Id rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitchass niggas know we stronger than these weaklings
Seeking for respect that aint there
Knuckleheads beware theres mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulette this mans wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razorwhich I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spat out at any adult that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Mad at the fact that somebodys getting lucci thats not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture
Joey Crack aka Keyser Sze
What the deal pop Ugh

Frontin hardcore deep inside the Jeep mackin

7983,"I do dirt in search of a clear mind
Money talk somebodys gonna hear mine
Grind early before 930
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death you heard me
My world aint worldly any time could be my time
I get high but still aint seen Chicago skyline
In my prime stakes is high cause its beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents we want the same face
And to think me and the president we from the same place
Fourhundred and twentyone murders aint tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven will I make it through the main gate
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Ah yes my Lord
Ah ah ahah ohohoh
Ah yes my Lord
Ah ah ahah ohohoh
Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap he was about to get put on
At his funeral listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming I hurt for em
A cold world thats why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
Ima need to go back I gots to get em
Back and forth in these streets thats the rhythm
Revenge is posed to be the Lords but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch cost my man his life
I cant afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

Aint wanna push kis Heaven couldnt wait
I was hurting couldnt get no work
You created me from dustthats why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now Im in a hearse whats this cash really worth
My whole life I had to worry bout eating
I aint have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the Kingdom for Chicago gon come
Im coming back like the Prodigal Son and I got a son
And I dont want my ways following him
The streets swallowing him and I dont want no hollows in him
His mama say she see his father in him hope its the good things
Til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates cause I know youve forgiven what Ive done
Im your son do I have the keys to get in

Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

Sweet Lord Jesus tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning fathers seed
Got a shipment by the sea see my niggas tryna eat
Eat whatevers on your plate save some for me
The worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to Heaven cause I couldnt get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back cause these stripes aint free
We still wading in the water
Cocaine blunts marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell em Talk is cheap niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust leave the praying to my mama though
Another motherfucker out of control just walking my soles
Whoa littered with the abuse
They wasnt for show I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day barefaced giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you They know me on the streets where I grew
If you aint from round here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for the keys to the kingdom
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

7569,"Niggas is tellin me about this Illuminati shit while Im in jail thats another way to keep your selfesteem low thats another way to keep you unconfident And Im putting the K cause Im killing that Illuminati shit Trust me These motherfuckers wanted to kill you why the fuck they gonna tell Farrakhan why they gonna tell the Nation of Islam why they gonna tell this nigga in jail about the plan How did he know Howd it leak to him Who told him Who told him the Pope Who Cause they like the Pope and the money aw cmon man get the fuck outta here
Oh you niggas wanna get deep
Niggas wanna kick knowledge Yall niggas aint deep man
Yall niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then Im like show me the proof right
Niggas start talking about the antiChrist and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga
Im a grown ass man Lets go lets go
You can lead a man to a drink but you cant make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link but that dont mean he gonn click
Whats this Yall aint really on no deep shit I peeped it
Scared of a motherfuckin secret society
And only bein with people you agree with you scared of a
Chalice scared of death only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up no new Bugatti Yes 
My enemy tryna stop me
But I dont stand a chance if I cant identify em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state and they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets they was Scholars early Illuminati was
Sorta like the students in Victor Hugos Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss em turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration Keep it goin 
And aint no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
Thats how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof show em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact aint no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real lifes more complex whats your context
They put the symbols on the dollar bill the monument the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
Its really just another case of stealin from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh
Population control is real word you know the deal but still
Perpetuate the cycle of violence we known to hold the steel
No I dont need no fuckin chorus
Used to read so many books thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really dont know what you reading if you really dont know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and thats a fact
Dont get caught in the distraction its bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed aint got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister worse than any blood sacrifice
You can imagine iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food vaccines humanitarian aid
They want control of the region they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Wheres the conspiracy Its always been the plan
Yall niggas scared of one world currency but still paying your
Taxes it aint the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of your enemy
Im leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat
Man we supposed to be brothas 
Oh what you tryna get smart
Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge
Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
Take that shit off
Beeping 
Oh you got a pager too huh
You a balla huh You a balla huh
Gimme that muthafuckin shit
Better me than the muthafuckin cops nigga

A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her maam
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Hold tight pat your foot dont let them carry it away
Dont let the heat overcome you when they play so loud

You cant dance I know you wish you could

5871,"I dont feel theres any point in trying to survive when people dont try to help me
When wewe share a community we should all be engaged and more involved in each others wellbeing you know
Now everyday that I walk outta my building
I see homeless people sleeping and chillin on the steps to the apartment that I live in
Im not saying everyones a victim
But the people that I live with treat em more like villains than actual citizens
I walk past a man laying in his own vomit
He gets his food and his garments by digging in the garbage
I beg your pardon Mr President but Im a resident
And since youve been in office I havent seen any evidence
Of things changin we go into Iraq and attack
When we got people on the streets without a roof over their back
Weve come to accept the homeless as part of our landscape
The money the government wastes could provide them with a safe place
To eat and sleep but we cease to see
That our own country is based around war power and greed
We got families on the street with nowhere to go
And the concretes the only place they have to call home
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling youre all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home Yo 
Feeling all alone
Now every face tells a different story a different message
Now how can we judge the book when we dont know the beginning
We dont know what turned em to the bottle or started injectin
We just see dirty clothes and another bum beggin
We dont see the kid who was an addict the second that his mom was pregnant
Or the young girl who was raped and stripped of everything sacred
Who now stands downtown walkin on the block pacin
Cause the only way she knows how to make it is gettin naked
We dont want to face it and it being the fact
That the government created the ghetto and gave it crack
To oppress immigrants and blacks and give em more of a setback
Like the last fivehundredyears wasnt enough to accomplish that
Now look at the homeless rate and tell me to my face that race
Doesnt play an intricate part in your fate in the United States
Now think about your home and the place that you sleep
And the homeless who only have the concrete
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling youre all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home Yo 
Feeling all alone
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that were living in is not fair
You wanna see change Then put your ones in the air
Now point it to the ground cause change starts right there
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that were living in is not fair
You wanna see change Then put your ones in the air
Now point em to yourself cause change starts right there
Cause change starts right there
The streets are cold all alone
In the city
Where you lay your head is your home
What a pity
People pass you by with a glance
Say youre filthy
But they dont know they pain youve been through
No not really

Be on the lookout for a tall lightskinned brother with dimples
Wearing a black Kangol sweatsuit gold chain and sneakers
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east
Alias LL Cool J Hes bad
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
No rapper can rap quite like I can
Ill take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso Im a MC cop
Make you say Go LL and do the Wop
If you think you can outrhyme me yeah boy I bet
Cause I aint met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter Im better my rhymes are good
I got a gold nameplate that says I wish you would
And when battles begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over you know Imma win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid dont play
Slaughter competition thats my hobby and job
I dont wear a disguise because I dont owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock I think my phone is tapped
Im bad
Cool J Cool J Cool J Cool J Cool J Cool J
Im like Tyson icin Im a soldier at war
Im makin sure you dont try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes been rappin for ten years and
Even when Im bragging Im bein sincere
Emcees cant win I make em rust like tin
They call me Jaws my hat is like a sharks fin
Because Im bad as can be got my voice on wax
Some brothers think hes making records now he must have relaxed
I couldnt I shouldnt and itll stay that way
The best rapper youve heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze take a look at what Ive done
Used to rock in my basement now Im number one
And can happen on time never standin on line
You wanna try me First you better learn how to rhyme
Im the pinnacle that means I reign supreme
And Im notorious Ill crush you like a jellybean
Im bad
Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group Bobcat E Love and the Cut Creator They are extremely bad so keep your eyes open Use extreme caution
I eliminate punks cut em up in chunks
You were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk
Im devastating Im so good its a shame
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane
Im as strong as a bull of course you know why I pull
I enjoy what Im doing plus Im paid in full
Not Buckaroo Banzai but bustin out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make MCs wish that Id die
Never retire or put my mic on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad just provin Im bad
You want a hit Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
MCs retreat cause they know I can beat em
And eat em in a battle and the ref wont cheat em
Im the baddest Takin out all rookies
So forget Oreos eat Cool J cookies Im bad
Cool J Cool JCool JCool J Cool JCool J
Never ever no never
Never wearin no Levis battle me why try
Ill treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy bye bye
Slaughterin MCs and Imma never get whipped
When I retire Ill get worshipped like a old battleship
LL Im bad all the rappers know
When I enter the center they say Yo yo there he go
My paychecks large Mr Bogart in charge
Not a puncher or hunter from a raccoon lodge
The original Todd teachin how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod
Youre a novice Im noble and I decipher my tongue
Not Attila the Hun nor Abdullah his son
My vocals exact like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag you get your rhymes from a grabbag
No good scavenger catfish vulture
My tongues a chisel and this compositions sculpture Im bad
Think Im gonna need backup 
Think Im gonna need backup 
Gimme that walkietalkie
Yo this is LL Cool J
And youll never catch me so dont even try it
Cause Im too bad for ya understand
Aaaaaahhhh Im bad

6393,"Feel like Im running out of time and the sun wont shine forever forever
I got my mind on my money and my money man fuck it whatever whatever
Sometimes I wake up on the wrong side I dont even feel like gettin up
But this depression on my brain hope it change but the rain aint lettin up
Cant call it dont know where my head is
Reflectin on Malcolm and the shit I thought but never said it
To Peter Robin to Kevin all my other friendships
That could hav would have should have and then thy ended
I isolate between happiness and hopeless
Know what makes it worse Still wanna get loaded
Sometimes I feel like I cant control my choices
And something takes over and I cant turn off the voices
Sittin with these thoughts cant escape em cant run
Got some bullets in the dresser as I polish my gun
They say a day clean is a day won
But Im holdin on prayin to a god abandoned
Zonin on the couch starin at my daughters
Know theres a pill in this house that Im obsessin about poppin
Reservations talkin the push and pull of the conscience
Should probably pick up the phone and call my sponsor but dont wanna
When the Percs dont work Xannies wont calm me down
Not enough liquor in the bar weed growin in the ground
Trapped by these walls where my brain cant get out
Wonderin if my mama have to put her son in the ground
We still goin when the day break
Me and the homies on the same page
Find me in the whip thats my safe place
Feel like Im gettin weak I need some AA
Need someone to pray for my soul right now
Everythings looking gray and theres no white clouds
I dont know what to say I got nothin to write down
On my knees questioning God like Why now
Im lost but Im found again
Im up all night I toss and turn
I love my life I got concerns
Ive been through Hell on some FML
Its just as well I might lose it
I need some light I need some air
I might be broken I need repair
Dont got the answers think Im confused
I asked myself Who are you
I need you right now Mack to wake up more than ever
Aint no more weed alcohol and poppin pills et cetera
I know these days gettin rough but they get better
Its a cold world lets go to the Gucci store for a sweater
Feel it deeply in my heart you need this letter
So I pour my feelings out to you before I go and mail it Fore I mail it 
I dont know what Im sensin but I can smell it
When you write me back just tell it Ima soak it up inhale it Inhale it 
Heard you got a daughter well I got one too
And she too beautiful barely see her too See her too 
Do you hug her and tie her shoes
Is she reflectin of you and got a smile that bloom Bloom 
Before you load that gun and shoot
Just know that she be needin you the best version of you too Bah 
I would write more but my day about to break
We can meet up facetoface just let me know if thats okay
We still goin when the day break
Me and the homies on the same page
Find me in the whip thats my safe place Thats my safe place too 
Feel like Im gettin weak I need some AA I need some AA 
Need someone to pray for my soul right now
Everythings looking gray and theres no white clouds
I dont know what to say I got nothin to write down Nothin to write down too 
On my knees questioning God like Why now Why

8060,"I Do Remix Lyrics
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I said now what it is what it do homegirl aint got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up flip it down weigh it up break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya whos ya daddy now
Aint even gotta open your eyes know what your looking at
And I aint even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight eye contact
Remember the night we first met I caught a contact
Now shes my ride or die its us against the world
You know we both hustlin so hustlin is our world
Said I mustve had too much to drink Im in my GMode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause its the GCode
Promise if I get locked youll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me youll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me its gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets youre gon be my lucky charm
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Man that boy so cold give him a blanket in here
I do I do I do oh oh
I Vito promise to treat this game ideal
Honor the code not bring drama to mamas peephole
Lifes a bitch but shes the only love that I know ow ow
So laadee after the I Dos lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot lets grab us a pot lets make a baby
Looking back I dont know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully cut that cake for me
I JayZ take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until Ive amassed a fortune too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never ever ever ever
Your secrets I treasure for better or worse
Youll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up my verse up
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
I do I do I do I do
Unh Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC Hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know Im just a boy that a woman could make a man of
So make me one I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when shes 81
Please dont give it all away I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around there more jaded that they become
But this one special so I make sure my suit will fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85 Im too legit
Im just tryna get her in the mood
And having her doing all the things shed only do when she get married
So lets do this shit
Tell the reverend all we missing is his blessing
Because before she popped the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchanged vows they clapped we take a bow
And shell be doing tricks for daddy when we take it to the house
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary
Baby you can have whatever you like the tooth fairy
Ill do anything to leave here tonight with you cherie
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
You know I do 
I said I do I do I do I do I do
Nothings more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him when those and them been defecating on me ughh 
Her would sense the heaven and him when Andre omen
Baby Im hell save me dont bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like like like love
Friend rock star and So and sos a genius
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh mommas sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit aint gon fall too far from tree
So if we ever woop the woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby shell be nerdy make the whole club swoon
Shell love books and cook and look just like you
And when shes done being young shell dress like you
Well call her Love 22 shell tote a 22 the laser version
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry
Gone off the Belvey and tron its too scary

Theres a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And theres nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But its the loudest sound youve ever heard

Into our darkest hour
But it was just a laugh just a laugh just a laugh just a laugh
Even at this angle and so we crumble
A ten ton head made of wet sand oh this dread circumference

7172,"Yo man its a lot of brothers out there flakin and perpetratin
But scared to kick reality
Man youve been doin all this dope producin
You aint had a chance to show em what time it is
So what you want me to do Express yourself 
Im expressin with my full capabilities
And now Im livin in correctional facilities
Cause some dont agree with how I do this
I get straight meditate like a Buddhist
Im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and thatll make you think
Some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach
Cause they dont flow like this one
You know what
I wont hesitate to diss one or two before Im through
So dont try to sing this
Some drop science well Im droppin English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express yo I dont smoke weed or sess
Cause its known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin
But makin a sucka and you equal dont be another sequel
Express yourself Ah ah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah 
Express yourself Smoke smoke 
Come on and do it Yeah kick it over here 
Express yourself Do it do it 
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Now gettin back to the PG
Thats program and its easy
Dre is back new jacks are made hollow
Expressin aint their subject because they like to follow
The words the style the trend the records I spin
Again and again and again yo you on the other end
Watch a brother sayin dope rhymes with no help
Theres no fessin and guessin while Im expressin myself
Its crazy to see people be
What society wants em to be but not me
Ruthless is the way to go they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hiphop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah they want reality but you wont hear none
Theyd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go lookin for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear NWA and say Hell no
But you know it aint all about wealth
As long as you make a note to
Express yourself Yeah yeah yeah 
Express yourself
Come on and do it Yeah yeah do it 
Express yourself Dr Dre Dr Dre in full effect and NWA 
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Express yourself
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You aint efficient when you flow
You aint swift movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis
Theres a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson all of em expression
And if you start fessin I got a Smith Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
Its Dre on the mic gettin physical
Doin the job NWA is the lynch mob
Yes Im macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin just like a fetus
Or a tumor but heres the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and hes up to no good
When I start expressin myself Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this Im doin damage
Or Imma be too hyped and need a straitjacket
I got knowledge and other suckas lack it
So when you see Dre a DJ on the mic
Ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight
Cause if I strike it aint for your good health
But I wont strike if you just
Express yourself
Yeah yeah this records almost over almost over gotta get hyped up 
Express yourself Do it do it 
Come on and do it Do it do it do it

I was down the hold just passing time
Last time we met it was a lowlit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time except you
You were talking about the end of the world
I took the money I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You you were acting like it was the end of the world
In my dream I was drowning sorrows
But my sorrows theyd learned to swim
Surrounding me going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy

When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
Itll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard Ive done some effed up things
From kicking them in the Nerfs to throwin away his ring
So if you love me love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
Im not embarassed nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past Ive been gamed
But that was then and this is now
And theres no way damn it theres no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of
When in Love
When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say I must have been deranged
Im talkin like pickin your lovers nose
Cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car
You could be partyin and havin a ball
But you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
Waitin for the phone to ring that aint right
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin youd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what Im speakin of
When in Love 2X 
When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
Like twoseater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens she got you strung
Guess it doesnt matter long as youre having fun
Lovell make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said Love makes things happen
Its most important to hear what Im rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above its not a fad
Youll do some crazy things when in love

2087,"Its coming on Christmas
Theyre cutting down trees
Theyre putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
But it dont snow here
It stays pretty green
Im gonna make a lot of money
Then Im gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
He tried hard to help me
You know he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
Im so hard to handle
Im selfish and Im sad
Now Ive gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye
Its coming on Christmas
Theyre cutting down trees
Theyre putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace

Wait a minute I saw your female with em too Whats up with her Ive been hearin that she been givin that stuff out to ALL them graffiti guys
Yo shut the fuck up Chico man

Professor whats another word for pirate treasure
Well I think its booty Booty booty thats what it is
Yes I got more bounce than the fucking bump
And then you want to know why
Because Im motherfuckin truckin
Im in the pocket just like Grady Tate
Got supplies of beats so you dont have to wait
Cause Im the master blaster drinking up the Shasta
My voice sounds sweet cause it has to
So light a match to my ass cause Im blowin up
Id like to thank the people for just showin up
But now I want yall to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And Im smurfin not rehearsin gettin live yall
A little puffy so you know what Im doin right
Cause thats the kind of frame of mind Im in
I got this feelin that its back again
So dont touch me cause Im electric
And if you touch me youll get shocked
You got you got you got you got you got
Youve got the boomin system but its sloshing out doodoo
You think its chocolate milk but its watered down Yoohoo
Ive been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me has always been music
Weve got our own studio the Son of the G
Its no question lifes been good to me
Cause life aint nothing but a good groove
A good mixtape to put ya in the right mood
This one goes out to my man the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which Ive been searching
Like two sealed copies of expansions
Im like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made Ben Davisquality its no junk see
My chrome is shining just like an icicle
I ride around town on my lowrider bicycle
So many wack emcees you get the TV bozak
Aint even gonna call out your names cause youre so wack
And one big oaf whos faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldnt finish
Cause writin rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
Im bad ass move ya fat ass cause youre wack son
Dancing around like you think youre Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
Ill put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
Ill take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped youre rockin rewindpause
Tryin to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like a pencil to the paper I got more to come
One after another you can all get some
So you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
Cause your shitll be stinkin when I go for mine
And thats right yall dont get uptight yall
You cant say shit because youre biting what I write yall
And thats wrong yall over the long haul
You cant cut the mustard when youre fronting it all
it all it all it all

8115,"Joey what you said 24 right
Aight cool I got you
I define gutter every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch hiphop got my spine smothered
But Ill be fine brother my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing thats word to my mother
You throw a shot at me Im throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint mines whistling by your top hat
Yeah Im cool but you violate and Ill cock back
Open the macs mouth and black out like I do not rap
Im sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Yall be making up stories the little kids is buyin
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I aint gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong pause
Veterans cosign me the upandcomers scared
The pretty girls go papi heres my underwear
Never in a hundred years I thought Id be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew Id be a factor
Im PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
Youre Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gaps so crazy
Im Gucci Louis V youre Gap Old Navy
I get coochie in the V you attract no ladies
Youre suburb Im gutter where the gats go crazy
Fuck a lecture aint tryna be Puns successor
That terms done fucker what up whatever
You birds is food Im about to pluck some feathers
Im young and clever plus clutch under pressure yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest thatll open your chest like a sunken treasure
Im somethin like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever Im rhyming on or whoever
I tear em apart swear on my pops
No fear in my heart shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks snapped fins with my jaws
Im all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back dumb birds I ignore the hype
Clickclack Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg cross me twice cant afford the price
Itll cost you Ill off your life
You soft I told you Im raw white when Im on this mic
Still mourn at night dont wanna see mornin light
And I feel like Im forced to fight
When the CHiPs are down like Ponch fallin off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome right
I got em in awe my auras Jordan like
Whats really poppin who diddyboppin
You wasnt really now you all Common and really conscious
I aint with that silly nonsense I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggies optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave theyre carvin Fucked with the wrong nigga
I dont write I kill a pen leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin my age
Forever vow to never smile when Im at peace
Only when Im eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemys internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led em in the belly of the beast
Youll be missin until fishermen see your corpse
Ill be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
Im a gorilla behind these bars on some zoo shit
Shoot you while youre talking on some news camera crew shit
Sicker than flyin in past tense on some flu shit
Dayold asshole flow I drop new shit
Exclusive you dont want it in fact
Ill have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you leavin your body he dont wanna go back
Thats when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
Its Crooked I the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat
Nickel yeah
I hope niggas know Ill show up to your show
Ill show up where you go show up to your do foes will explode
Shells fore they hit the floor I know niggas know
I got a open window flow I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why sheeeeeeeeeeeeit
Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like OShea
Ridin shotgun with Chris Martin my DJ
Not the White boy but Im down for the Coldplay
Forever stay violent better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up clap niggas up scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it aint no mo aint no dough
Get into his ass cause I aint opposed Im a livin anal probe
Im a lameophobe matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin why the fuck not 
When I was a teen I used to pack a threeeighty
Now Im spittin sittin between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she aint shave
I leave the booth smellin like somebody aint sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I aint crazy
Im like Marty McFly goin back in time
And dissin his momma nigga you cant fade me
They say he a bastard for real then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin whys he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks I RIP it
So even to the producer its hard to ID it
Bars tremendous its in your best interest
I insist your men just do your best Bush rendish
Endless move more than two inches
My bloodll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me maana
Or see the speed of a llama underground prima donna
That aint hard to find pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E Honda he a monster
I love war its like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin hard I see vagina pause
Nah rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine manoamano
When it rains it pours grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin with Mouse the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle and an eagle eye
Closed casket now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head dudes callin you Crotchface
So yall could bump Swag Like Us
But the next time raps discussed add this as a plus
Dont nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fags might bust
And since poppin tags is a must what 
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin their drawers now your crew is in awe
How you ball your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon need another processor to process it
Ill set it I said it
So keep running around hotheaded til you get hot leaded
Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it niggas is piethetic
Rap what you cant afford yall must got credit
All you gotta know is Crooked I Royce Bless and Joell
With Joe spell NO L

5887,"Still getting mine in the 1 9 9 9
Yo just relax take it easy slow down
I had thisI had this friend of mine
Who just you know he was moving too fast you know what Im sayin
I told him to slow down he said the sun dont chill
I said I said still I said still you gotta
Just appreciate life sit back dont let it fly right past you
No matter what go on Im still gettin mine
No matter the year no matter the place no matter the time
Check it
Its like Im fighting for freedom writing for freedom
These record company niggas I dont like when I see em
My ancestors when Im writing I see em and talk with em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with em
Shitted on so many rappers its like Im in the stall with em
Molest concepts stalk rhythms paid dues bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heavens call
Preachers daughters get fucked in the reverends hall
MCs reckless eyeball why yall wanna go and do that
Mustve thought I was solo the name just aint the UAc
No mo still together
Like in the ghetto photo with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say Im nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry my poetrys a penitentiary track is visitation
Sentences is life Im like chief up in this demonstration
Still
You squirm with discomfort wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
Imma show yall in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to always played the low
Its like a competition this mission here Im telling you
Slip up and rhymeass niggas here is felling you
Crash courses slow down you cant learn that quick
Cause Im the dead eye with the red eye from Chi to LI
I thought yall knew every year I grew Im still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girlll be showing
A male seed praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to thats why I chose this
Now is the glass halffull or halfempty
Common why they tempt me
The king of the simply bore in mic
I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like
I know yall hate that why I feel I owe yall everyday
If yall hear it a thousand times its gon be the same way
The DatFather go farther why bother
Now Im a peaceful man I dont want no stress
You know Im still
Yo yo some get Range Rovers some religion changeover
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga games over aint no payola in freestyle
In battles Im warring like a GChild
Searching for the child in me this style in me
This release is like the piece thats now in me
They tried to sassinate me god like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on em cause Im the style Nitti
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with me till the tilt
Told her my chambers like Wilt

Shes the only one whod phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

6936,"Now this may sound disgusting and like very gross
But its sure to have you trippin so yo listen close
Its not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar
But its rather on the bug tip and its called Pickin Boogers
Now what Im sayin might not be kosher to you
But its still somethin we all have to do
So go up your nose with a finger or two
And pull out one or a crusty crew
Yo dont try to front like its so gloomy and gray
Cause we all pick our boogers some time every day
Whether out in the open or on a sneak tip
With a finger tissue or even a QTip
Take it from the Biz Markie because Im jokin
And also remember this slogan
Hey ma whats for dinner
Go up your nose and pick a winner
Pickin Boogers 4x 
Let me tell you what happened on the train man
I was coolin one day with my partner Kane
Headed up to the Rooftop ridin the D train
When the man sittin next to me was so profane
Hed stick his finger up his nose damn near to his brain
You should a moved 
I was just about but all of a sudden homeboy just pulled out
A big green slimy nah Im not neven gonna say it
But it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it
He sat there for a while with it in his hand
So I tried to play cool and like ignore the man
So I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap
All of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap
Now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke
But a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked
So I dug up my nose and pulled out about five
And plucked every last one of them dead in his eye
Then the man jumped up and said Whats wrong with you
And wiped them off his face and said I cant mess with you
Like if I did something that was so full of shame
But yo you got to know the name of the game
Hmmm
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Back in public school with my partner Kane
When I was class clown and he was my brother
Sittin at the desk pluckin boogers at each other
Never doin work as we was supposed
Cause we was too busy diggin up our nose
And in the lunchroom you would talk about rude
God forbid the person thatd leave his food
No matter who you are we didnt give a damn
We even put teachers down with the program
Whether if it was a woman or if you a man
We put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand
Catch anyone from anywhere
But the best fun about it catchin Kane out there
Especially when we playin ball in the gym
I put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him
Now were grown up and things have changed
But we still be playin the pickin boogers game
Just last night when Kane was gettin ready
I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti
Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl
One night at Latin Quarters I was standin at ease
I saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez
I didnt show enough that I really did want it
So no half steppin I pushed up on it
Pulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat
Had a spotlight beamin on my Biz Marck hat
But when she stepped in the light and she got real close
I saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose
She was dressed real def and her body was hooked
But that dried up booger just ruined her look
I wanted to tell her about it but I couldnt be bold
So I played if off and said thats a cute green mole
I was hopin from that she would wipe it away
But she didnt do nothin I guess she wanted it to stay
I said before you get my number I dont mean to diss you
But write it in your hand because youre gonna need the tissue

6606,"Yeah
Can I ever really find a way to let go of you
I been thinking about it every time that Im in a booth
Try to put together everything that we do
Every step we take is away from the truth
Whats the point of a relationship
If every other day we gotta save that shit
Its gotta be love thought we found it
Ship has been sinking we both have been drowning
All the hatred that we been allowing
All the alcohol that we been downing
Afraid to commit but afraid to let go Im alone I can feel all the demons surrounding
Been a while since I recognized
Who I see when I look in my eyes
Trying to breathe but the more that I try
More that I suffocate dying inside
Tried to be different we both tried to listen Im sorry that I had to leave you behind
All of the bitching was causing division I had to let go I was losing my mind
Locked in a prison got lost in the vision of somehow believing that we would be fine
Made the decision to leave this position and put all my pain in the faith of divine faith of divine faith of divine 
All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive
Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me but it wasnt our time
Still Ill love you till the day that I die day that I die day that I die 
Took it too fast but we were taking it slow
Hang on tight or we can let it go
We can surrender and just move on
We can be stubborn because we are strong
We can pretend that what we both know aint true
I dont mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth
I wish I could stay here to be your protection
Loving myself is what I been neglecting
The most difficult part is the patience
While taking in all of these changes
I dont mean to be acting evasive
Im pretending I dont wanna face this
I get sick to my stomach when I think about someone else touching you now Im anxious
All I got left is a picture of us
All because we had broken the trust
Been working on gaining it back for a year but the spark has been missing it turned into dust
Miss the high that I got from your touch
Both of us felt an adrenaline rush
Codependent treated you like a crutch
My heart was stolen brutally crushed
Question is will I ever know
What we we could have been if I let you go
If I need to walk this path alone
All on my own cause I need to grow
Fuck Im sick of this
Feeling like a mother fucking hypocrite
Made a lot of mistakes I gotta live with it
Find a way to let it go and be indifferent
Quit talking quit talking quit talking 
All we can take is one day at a time
Be patient and open to seeing the signs
Love is a war that you might not survive
Happiness is what I hope you will find when you feeling the vibe and you meet the right guy
Thought it was me but it wasnt our time
Still Ill love you till the day that I die day that I die day that I die 
Took it too fast but we were taking it slow
Hang on tight or we can let it go
We can surrender and just move on
We can be stubborn because we are strong
We can pretend that what we both know aint true
I dont mind it and neither do you
Nothing to gain just something to prove
We can try this love again or face the truth

Until we take it back you probly wont be feelin rap

Bigger than Asgard hittin ya ass hard
Act it out cause theres no time to word shit
You never win wit Wordsworth the wordsmith
The verse gets tighter every second the earth twists

Prefer this now wait a minute whats that I heard skip
Nerves twitch played this so much its probably your third disc
On purpose at your service basement to surface
Learn this how can you rehearse somethin thats perfect
Isnt it funny when you use your favorite pen
And get your rhyme pad write shit thats truly bad
Embarrass yourself make a fuckin mockery
End the hypocrisy you never toppin me
Im the monopoly in jail is your cacophonies of unfair policies

Attitude angry snotty

Time to hang Aint gotta bring a posse
Through rainy days she got me like Whitney stay wit Bobby
Yo your cake is in the kitchen your wishful premonition
Is turned around by my firm thoughts of demolition
Its time to numb your run and dim your vision
Its time to give up the hopes and dreams of major acquisition
Aint got a droptop that goes 0 to 60
But after shows ladies drop tops and show they titties
Across the globe you cant oppose its risky
Or even go against me
Im Words so every time that you flow you spit me
We in the asphalt you cause your last fall
Insult to injury is when we curse the salt
Douse the open wound to the tomb
Its time to sit back and watch professionals in full bloom

Or beat down for ya flag
Cause if you is or you aint a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
Cause youll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 411
All the ol school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin did my head grow
Will the boys in the hood have to beat down Ice Cube
Hell no Ill static son youll see its okay
I keep my nine anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab
Im still rollin wit Da Lench Mob
Americas Most Wanted 
Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me you know that Im liable
To bust a cap cause its all about survival of the fittest
Im a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I repo your Vette then jet
Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue but they cant catch me yet
Cause Im slick and slippery
They cant get with me cops aint shit to me
I cant dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad mad cause Im the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKas Most Wanted
Aiyo heres what the poster read
Ice Cube is wanted dead
Thats all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and sireens
When I fiend first they yo rings now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
Its the American way
Cause Im the GANGSTA
Ice Cube a motherfuckin klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept so
Who gets the worm
And if Im caught in a trap wou know Ima beat the wack
With a payoff cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick stay off
Im not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
Im a nigga with a S on his chest
So get the Kryptonite cause Im a rip tonight
Cause Im scarin ya wanted by America
Aiyo Cube man they on your ass 
Word but who the fuck is Herb
Its time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a Caucasian
Cocked the hammer didnt crack no smile
Take me to your house pal
Got to the house my pockets got fat see
Crack the safe got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later Im at the PAD
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin in the den yo it couldnt be
What up G Saw my face on TV
Damn oh shit I didnt know I lucked out
Struck out I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol bitch down the street mustve turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin my own kind
The police didnt pay it no mind
But when I start robbing the white folks
Now Im in the pen with the soaponarope
I said it before and Ill still taught it
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted

Resources depleted for the defense
Im offended by these authentic liars
Shouldve been retired let me identify them
Youll never get me quiet my people been inspired
Im the little fire flickering within the riot
Feel it vibrate shake awake sleeping giant
Keep them vibrant and vital and reenergize them
Our times arriving our shine is blinding
They cry were violent demonize it
Guys on the wrong side of right find us frightening
Pray lightning strike twice ice on their eyelids
Isis Osiris Christ in his likeness
Day of resurrection bring life to the lifeless
Tear the wall down pull a crown of a tyrant
Rebuild gentrify the planet for the righteous
He who sacrifices for the greater good
Elevate them where they should to the title of your highness
Only tribe surviving is the pious pious
United by the mighty human life tie that bind us
Hunger find kindness minds find refinement
The sightless guided by the blind are the blindest
We read the signs inscribed in the horizon
Bright yellow shot through the night time fajr
Oh thank you master for my soul
Lord hold me close dont let me go
Oh thank you master for my soul
Lord hold me close dont let me go
The long suffering long for relief
The hard working meek still drowned in grief
Houses are seized and they tossed in the street
The orphans of greed in the culture of deceit
Strong hunt the weak and the poverty steep
Wages dropping beneath yet the cost still increase
Officers deep keep force of police
The fourheaded beast wild all off the leash
Hardhearted beast with a jaw full of meat
Engulfed in a feast while you starve at his feet
He toss you the least little portion of a piece
To the floor and expect you to rejoice when you eat
Survival can seem the impossible feat
But you roll up your sleeves and you sow all your seeds
Toil in the soil but youre not allowed to reap
So you toss and you scream like a horrible dream
Woke out your sleep got you forced to your feet
Feel the pulse of your people in the heart when it beat
The vultures they keep bringing halt to your peace
Pull the sword out the sheath keep the wolves off of the sheep

I was five and you were ten boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you
Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said
Little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And Im still waiting
Im waiting
Ooh still waiting
Im just a fool
Ooh Im a fool
To keep waiting
For you
Im waiting
Ooh still waiting
Fot love
For you
Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said
Little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And Im still waiting
Love has never shown his face
Since the day
You walked out that door
You filled my life with empty space
Come back
Cant you see its you Im waiting for
Dont you know Im waiting
Im waiting for love
For you
I miss you
Im waiting

Come on back

Im a man whos been hurt a little too much
Now Ive tasted the bitterness of my own tears
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel
I cant stand up for falling down

Still it confused me
Why Im not loved the way I should be

And Ive roomed with fear

And Ive wrestled with tears

You broke it in two

Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh ah 
You think that I dont feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In those eyes I see reflected
A hurt scorned rejected
Love child never meant to be
Love child born in poverty
Love child never meant to be
Love child take a look at me
Started my life in an old cold rundown
Tenement slum Tenement slum 
My father left he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name
Ah this love were contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
Well only end up hating
The child we may be creating
Love child never meant to be Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Love child Scorned by society
Love child always second best Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Love child different from the rest
Hold on hold on just a little bit longer Mmm baby
Hold on hold on just a little bit longer Mmm baby
I started school in a worn torn dress that somebody threw out Somebody threw out 
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me
Ah dont think that I dont need you
Dont think I dont wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame Ive been wearing
Love child love child never quite as good Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Afraid ashamed misunderstood Just a little bit longer love child

8162,"I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a 100 the Game spit 3 I said Fuck it
Ima have to show these niggas something
Too easy whod believe me if I said that it wasnt
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didnt think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said Nobody benefits everyone perishes
I tell them this they say Here its time for your medicine
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to 44 4s 22 times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lying
You like red or white wine Lets talk about it Im buying
Lets talk about the Children of Zion excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming Ive mastered it certainly surely
Ill celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it dont coagulate
The sex magik wont work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor more than a rapper
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour then a taser then a laser
Then a maser then a phaser then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why Coup de grce for the coup dtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think Ive had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off I promise you well just talk
No biting allowed just bark dont run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought thought manifests words actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
Im a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself then how would I be
If I do not look tell me how will I see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still cant recognize myself
I dont need anybody but myself
When Im rhyming like this I dont need no help
But thank you for your purchase these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy you wanna be the best you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield ED Fields
Chew MCs like Im eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
Its no use if you cant use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone numbers placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it I dont wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress shes an actress
This is Monster Ball practice Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I dont care if were not the same colour nigga Im your brother
I dont care what you say nigga you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind waves bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing where are you Are you hiding
No I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so Tell the people they need to know
And if you dont think so youre a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say Im crazy I say So tell me something I dont know
Something my psyche profile doesnt show
I dont have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus Answer me
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out No do not go
Where the fuck are you going
400mph wind belts blowing think for a moment
We got to wait it out thats what the trainings about
We have to survive thats what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing
Tough pliable relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I cant rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasnt been made yet
Cause I havent been paid yet not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating I tried to save them they wasnt patient
Responsibility entrusted
Theres only one way for me to prove that I love it thats why Im busting
If you pursue revenge dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that youve made
Musically still producing I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureates my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it concentrate you can hear it
Ive almost perfected this Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you cant forget
Oprah Winfrey dont like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably dont like black
I dont blame her she dont understand its only entertainment
She probably wouldnt feel different if she wasnt famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist if not racist with colour
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon not the sigil this is for real though
I sit down and think when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God even Im stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead thats not fair
Who I talk to Go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
I procured a small piece of the treasure collections from a former era
Dating back to forever the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law I dont govern them
I summon them speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet woodwinds strings
The conductor brings the drums in finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance Hip Hop justice rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered liars are denied water you still alive
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary patrolling the open seas at UBoat speed
Beneath the Tsunami where Im supposed to be
Industrialists civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Cosigned by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding lyrics timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it its going to have a word with me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this theres no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieris Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit whos ready
Ill need a volunteer do I have any
Next year Ill get my SPINGS a master space badge
After that Ill stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devils chamber
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The leaders lies got me reassigned my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
Im a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
Well shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like theres a bus up the street
The Dr and I would meet at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health killing myself
Rebuilding myself nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill getting more ill
The woman who is there she will take care of you
With Nexium Avodart Lipitor and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second One answer per session
Hip Hop made me Hip Hop praise me
Aint nothing changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy battle me baby
1000 Bars nigga after that maybe
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians I do it for the soldiers
Raptors Comanches Strykers Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fighting the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where we gon go
Starving in destitution dying for retribution
Why would you wanna blow a hospital You stupid
Why would you not force yourself to make better music
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot 4 ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor I see excitement coming
I raise my hand lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say were divided I say were small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
783 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
1000 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary but tell me whos the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when Im touring
Acupuncture point or plus is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute or debate
My face is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing from the other side it looks like its opening
Where am I trying to go with this
Fire and Ash fallout thats what its all about
We must construct a shelter and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
It wont happen til AFTER the official autopsy
A good psychological environment for science
Im memorizing visualizing peace and quiet
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But Im unprepared to take action just like you
The innate need for Canibus to be professional
Make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you
Greetings and salutations my equations are inundated with information
Electro cranial stimulation
Burn skin off face burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation
Any and ALL entry points have immigration
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble the effects of gravity on my
Muscles were quite subtle
I do what I want to do I have always been that way
Because I have always thinked that way
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future
Pulsating lights and sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats layered underneath lyrics
250 thousand cycles per second for Dolphin hearing
The electrical optical coupling Gear is effective
88 Kilometres above the planet
My rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding
The Gods began to call me I looked up
Stars fell towards me and scorched me to a metaphor freak
The authentic Command Doctrine of George Washington
Himself GW Im positive its him
I proof read my writtens eat a chicken with the skin missing
Spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die Now its dont vote Why
Weed is now legalized are you high
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
Be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
But not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr Iconoclast
If you dont leave the bottle outside you cant pass
Gather the evidence then give it to the President
Dont reprimand him ask him for help next 190
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I cant wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web everyday we are burying dead
Every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
Youll never reach the end of it 200
Fire and forget rhyme for respect
I didnt get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause Im familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said let it be written let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This never been done before in history
I spit at a thousand KIPS kilo tons of pressure
Every letter is measured in such a way you will remember
December 21st 2012 is the code
It was placed on the sunstone to puzzle them
Starting with some numbers the code crackers start crunching
I better have some results by the months end
Really Deep Blue computes deeply and does it
What is the answer to Universe Read me the numbers
In the summer the Polar Manitobas melted by lava
A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
The Rear Admirable participated in battle every war and at least half of my
Crew were injured every tour
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force would give us
All what we needed we were wrong
Canibus is notably known Globally
My verbal sorcery somehow talks to the beat
Lyrically you not ready dress right dress
Not messy my muscle memory make me bomb squad steady
You cant contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes ears nose throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
Recite 33 3s 33 times
For 24hrs 21 thousand Nautical miles
Ahead of my lifetime I write and recite rhymes
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth when you apply it
Devine design a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I cocreate rap 30
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets I attack it
Access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
Finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
They cant battle me so theyd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
I am still the Master
As handsome as my unborn Grandson Rip The Jacker
Call me grandpa 40 as odd as it may seem
The microphone fiend is God of the Hip Hop regime
Planet Rock Supreme
Kill you with green Lasers evaporated weed vapour Electromagnetic Scalar
Then something they call a Maser
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Meteors fall from the sky The Mars God looks at my eyes
Controlling my heart controlling my mind
Oh Lord Tell me what to do Tell me oh Lord
I have mastered the art of rhyming I am so bored
My pain my joy my thoughts Ive passed them on thru songs
Respond to me and I will answer to your call
Emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions Reality
Thats how it has to be
In front of me on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me 60
Sitting down at the mixing boardroundbanquet table comfortably
They begin to study me by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely I rose I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship pulling me with planet like inertias
Words blinking like the text edit cursor
My sentences are sometimes too sensitive to make sense of it
Layer upon layer upon layer unedited
You lazy you wanna be the best You crazy
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
Propulsion system is gravity driven white hot thermal
External vision every lyric got a wormhole in it
Saint Germaine is real Germaine is a sage for real
My sigil is the double headed eagle seal
Normal life is not real we are cogs in a wheel
We work we hurt we search we feel
The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics
Circular motion in both the para and the hyperbolas
Tiger Woods knows this everytime he plays golf he shows this
A true master at the masters in focus
In my time of need I am not alone
I was told in a dream by Cthulhu from his tomb
Try to hurt me Ill murder you lay you down vertical
Made your life purposeful germinated the earth with you
My black goggles are covered with Bat Guano
Ill hang from the ceiling and watch you act hostile Ill pop you
Rap Music and those who listen to it dont owe me nothing
I dont want nothing from you not even your judgement
The Philosophic maverick the massive knowledge magnet
Underwater sea lilies are the source of my magic
Matricidal motherfucker homicidal hustler
Filibuster never been a Wikipedia lover
If I were you I wouldnt waste time reading that rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet but fuck it
Leviathan divides the suspect zero sign
Therefore I rhyme for all time
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Unnatural battle ability the enemy tried to imprison me
But they wouldve been better off killing me
Theoretically Shiaperrelli has mentored me
With motifs of illuminated speech and wizardry
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
Sound pours out of the ground across the land
Jethro Tull was mauled by the god called Pan
Creative writing and rhythm grammar and composition
Dont ignore me ignore the fool who tells you not to listen
To you it shouldnt sound like Im quitting cause Im not
If I am to continue its up to Hip Hop
Weary of body and mind tired of swimming against the tide
Why swim or walk when I can glide
Zero Gravity exercising requires expert timing for sky diving
My call sign is Flying Wing
An impossible profession
St Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message
Now you may go
You have graduated now you may know
Tell the world exactly what you were shown
Sho nuff sesame street poems brought to you by Sears Roebuck
Countdown 48 more months
Does it amaze me NO Does it phase me maybe a little yo
Gotta find a way to generate doe
Promoter wont pay me what I want for a show
Why do it for free when Im worth my weight in gold
Mind Body Soul inseparable incredibly
Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually
Hip Hop became boring lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ
But they should be more important
The diaphragm the thymus
Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras
You get the Guantanamo Bay the Alcatraz way
You heard what I say These pigs gotta pay
I steady my approach this supposed to be a no fly zone
Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes
The hurricanes eyes open
Gale winds blowing Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean
I figured out how to save water in a drought
If we save the right amount I know we can make it out
The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy
The quantum biology biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
Even when you press rewind your still left behind
Father Author Poor Pauper breaths to draw Prana
In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama
Your ear cartilage has been targeted The bombing will commence
Dont be a bitch nigga you started it
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
Drawing mathematics suspended in space as holographics
Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style its like trying to ride a bull
The lyrical inimical is miserable because Ive built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Am I a mad man or a mason A patriot or a pagan
West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons
The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated
Im waiting on the parts special order replacements
Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment
Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites Fuck all the haters
My luck was crushed I felt like they fronted
My heart kept pumping I had to do something
I turned the page wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal XRays they say I dont burn I blaze
Dont look at it like winning or losing in 98 it was amusing
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit
Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping
But right now my image stands still in a prism
My light reflects like a mirror I choose to share it
The Precession of Earth is nearing Im preparing
Assessment and Planning things should I put mustard on these sandwiches a
Fathers job is so challenging
My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease
You cant Emcee take a seat
What are you building Bis Is it a flying Silver Disk
If you ever leave youll be missed
I tear thru the Galactic drift I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes
Now thats some shit You think thats fast Nah
Thats faster than you think By the time you blink the whole Universe shrinks
A word to the wise try to keep your eyes in the skies
And try to keep your ears on my rhymes
A magic reminder that the fire will not expire
Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when Im tired
The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt Im forced to look downward
Now I see inside the Earth
I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass
But it wont last were killing her with greenhouse gas
You said the best shouldnt have to ask for respect
Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES
I hold Hip Hop responsible
Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles
Gone til November Ill be gone forever
I made these bars so you could ALL remember
The illest MC to put it all on the line
My career was crucified but Im still alive
Sky scraper spaceships wide crater dry lake beds
resistance is futile they said
I bear clutch the pen my girlfriends jealous again
So intimate when I write its a sin 200
My electromagnetic rap flytrap
Theres no way Earth you can get around that
This is a no brainer stop the complaining
If Hip Hop is dead Im here to save it
Pages upon pages everything Ive created
The bar was below basic I had to raise it
I did it for my Fathers I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
My poetry is peaceful aggressive but regal
Progressive to the people I hope the words reach you 210
Dr Watson and Crick found an 3rd strand in the DNA helix
So your not what you think
Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum
The beat is my slave and it will behave as I want
Cheers I spill beer on my bear skin chairs
I shed tears I loved Hip Hop all these years
Poet Laureate Infinity
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
Nobody do it better there aint a truer Ripper
I did this separate imagine what we could do together
Inspired by GOD inspired by the suffering
Was it done by a prophet It must have been who was it then
Rip The Jacker hot but cold blooded
Many utter the name but very few love him
33 is the number that enlightens the Brothers
Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest
The ramifications are awesome what should we call it
I call it my unacknowledged special access project
My skull is a submarine hull
In a cave below ground with a painting of Cthulhu on the wall
Necronomicon grimoires open the doors
The vortex that reaches from here to beyond10
The power to control thoughts however remotely
Through a term Id like to call Pulse Detonation Poetry
The results from SETI very interesting
I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testing
My team was credited we turned over the evidence
But not before I could leverage it for promotion to President
Cover me 8 point sighting device for the eyes
FIRE Transition if you go dry
Close your eyes ritualize spit your rhymes
Without trying you can shift your mind
Canibus altered the sequence nucleotides
Neuropetides only get high off mature Wine
Start timing Atomic Clock keeps time perfectly 20
Mrs Guutoff my band teacher always would work me
Polyester pants big fat ass
I loved that woman so much I paid attention in class
My Spanish teacher Mrs Booker had an ass too
Why am I talking about this to you
One day this will be known for now I must wait
I still love them both and I never forget a face
At the time I used my Beta waves more than my Theta waves
Then there was greater way I learned at a later date
The rate of learning began burgeoning and wouldnt let up 30
Mommy noticed my vocabulary I developed
Telencephalon olfactory lobes I had to practice
When a woman has her period I smell it on the mattress
It got to be difficult for any woman to live with me
I know my history but what could that mean specifically
The story of Bruce Lee I died in my sleep
I was weak it happens with every girl that I meet
A Clairvoyant Technique
Using XRay refraction Not only can I see into the future
I can see past it 40
But I dont know what it means I pass the DataStream along to my team
They say its more than a dream
Killing caused by poisonous vapours Lasers Tasers Masers
Electromagnetic Scalars
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Listen to the rhymes the rhymes equal pie
If I had a piece of the pie I could buy Dubai
Rip The Jacker was born the bow was drawn
Spit a 100 bars before you could run 100 yards 50
I seen a mushroom to the north from my porch
It was odd every dog in the neighbourhood barked
You wanna stand there and talk
The blast wave gonna tear more than your roof off nigga Cmon
It is my understanding that when Im high Im channelling
But when Im out with the family I am animal handling
Observe a man who has a third DNA strand
Or a 5th or a 6th this is way more advanced
I remove the veil from in front of me suddenly
The roots of my discovery uncovered skulduggery 60
I am not innocent but you cannot punish me
Cause I know what the world wants to see tragedy
What is Germaine determined to ascertain for his self
Few of the same ilk have known what I felt
Theres a Proverb that goes One should know thyself
Before one can know the world so I showed myself
The unidentified submersible looked like a giant turtle half circle
Yo I need to stop smoking purple
Requested selected elected but thats only impressive to the experts
Who know how to manipulate my message 70
You lazy and you wanna be the best I repeat
Dont talk about consciousness when you are consciousless and weak
If I die and YOU happen to wake up Im still alive
Please explain my complete life story to my children
Photo stills of the cryospill
Solarized film revealed there was a biofield
Fuck a record deal my training is real
Look at the sword I wield you will taste my steel
Phase I sign the MOU pursue more voters
Theres three more phases that I think you should know 80
Phase II build the force Phase III sustain Ops
Phase IV transition of Border Patrol Cops
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La SiDo
These are the tones that will activate the ohms
No telling if it will bring out the best or the worst in you
It would be a miracle if I was merciful
Are you food for the moon Or are you in the mood for doom
Furniture moves when I walk into a room
STRYKER BRIGADE Driver sometimes I was GUNNER
Check points required all the concentration I could muster 90
Special Weapons And Tactics Professional Assassin
I dont know what he does for a living ask him
I kneel before Congress and beg for money
Submitting specifics about the operation Im running
You gotta love it what was it called The G8 Summit
Never heard of it no details are public
The relative radiance of the rhyme makes it shine
Increasing the star wattage with longer cycle time
Yeah I bust the rhymes but I customize the lines
And by the looks of things I did it just in time 100
I marched from the Halls of Montezuma to Tripoli
Physically this mission objective is killing me
I submit to the will of the creator willingly
The possibilities present a probable infinity
I looked into LLs eyes we both cried
Meteors immediately fell from the skies
Ive apologized but I cant change who I am
I can change future cant budge the past
Them pretty ass lyrics is for bitches with acrylic
Only fake niggas catch feelings over silly shit 110
SPORTS locked and loaded zero you in from the pillbox
Williams How many kills you got
The uniforms match so we all look the same from the sky
They only time they notice the difference is when we die
Is dying a wise thing What about trying
What about our family members back home crying
Man made weapons Star Ship Captain etc
George Lucas showed me a full size replica
We circled for a fly over in a black KIOWA
5 soldiers including me and a pilot called Noah
He passed over a top secret dossier folder half opened 120
I noticed the words MOSES and CONUS
MOSES is a new weapon system secret code
CONUS is the continent of the US I suppose
The jump light lit up Master Chief said Lets Go
All right men this is what we train for
Williams you gotta go first if you say so HALO High Altitude Stay Low
Gale Winds blowing this might be the death of me
The AIRBORNE unit in the back of me jumped out next to me
Gold chords from the organ cut down your swordsman
Tell everybody to shut the fuck up when Im talking 130
Not in current version fuel mix rich human hydrogen slush
The rhymes are too Christ Complex like for them
The 1000 Bar race at an unrelenting pace
Just in case Humans ever get to World War 8
Do you believe in fate Then how do you know
When you finally get there where will you go
This aint no joke you think Im joking
Everything frozen melted destroyed broken
Only the chosen find a way out
Everybody move out Stay off the main route 140
Satellites watch me they think they got me
Right hands turn left shoulders around but its not me
Atmospheric Reentry a flying sighting looked like lightening
Striking blind what it struck was frying
Comparative image sharpness between all artists
I dont think you know what youre about to get involved in
Ill give a quadrillion dollars to be a partner
If you are still worshipping money you are Godless
Sulphuric Nitric Acid eats through the Labyrinth
The foundation is cracking we must take action 150
Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth BIBLE
I take shelter in an old Missile Silo
Hip Hop is blackened pot placed next to a kettle
With my logo in it a rigid rehomogenized metal
Millions of you are unfamiliar with what Im saying
Discuss it with your Chemistry Professor he will praise it
Tri Quad Quintangulate where did the signal originated
Try to find out more information
The internal atheist outside the MATRIX
Sophia Stewart offered me a pill and said take this
She asked me if I was followed I told her I wasnt
I didnt know the spy that sold me out would be my own cousin
A populace uniformed is a populace of slaves
Washington didnt say it quite that way
But its something like that you get the point Im assuming
Poet Laureate Exclusive New Shit
The message said We should meet somewhere clandestine
Professor keep heading East to the Best Western
Do not loose your bearings keep checking your direction
Start Session point 666 arc seconds
The budget is huge I have doubts about spending it
Concerning Cyclotronic Resonance patents are pending it
Canibus aka The Spitzberg Beast
Gave his Bicentennial Speech on Emerald Peak
Youll need a first aid kit for the verse I spit
I am cautiously meticulous but artfully brisk
A change is beginning every molecule is spinning
Lyrics imitate the art art imitates lyrics can you hear it
Signals bounce back and forth like a mirror
With flawless error like that forever
Surface the air radar tells me where they are 180
Are they far I patiently watch the sweep arm
We can find them but they cant find us
Just below Mach 3 the rhymes ionizes
Im hooked on Hip Hop I cant live without it
You can mix this song a thousand ways I dont doubt it
The daughters of man locked in prison camps
With the sons of mothers that are too weak to dance
At least we notice damage what do we expect
The coming super storm is gonna wipe us off the map 190
But that is not possible thats sounds completely illogical
You mustve been kicked the fuck out of school
Always remember the Reptilian agenda
No Pulse Rendered in the earthquakes epicentre
I found fluoride in my water supply
At the time I felt a total apathy towards dying
The ungrateful dead reoccurring images playing in my head
I was told to memorize what I was said
With this salt I consecrate this water
May whatever it touch receive Hallowed LIGHT from THEM
With this sacred water I consecrate this Talisman so that
It will make ME POET LAUREATE otherwise Ill be so depressed oh well no
Regrets I been toe to toe with the best I KNOW the LEDGE
I accept all cultures colours creeds and races
Life is Life no taxonomical classification
No corruption no disruption no destruction no budget no nothing
Its never that easy you just gotta trust it
A leader I feel beleaguered to teach the truth
The Youth will refuse to follow if they dont believe you
There is strength in numbers there are numbers in strength
Nothing good comes from hatred Loves the missing link
Even if I am in a minority of one
The truth is still the truth no matter how its spun
My mind is prepared Hip Hop is impaired
If you disagree with me then yours isnt there
I rock rhymes for your pleasure you listen at your leisure
I only record it once you listen to it forever
The fish hook stuck in your jaws the feedback was not positive
Human Hominids fishing for compliments
Started with a nugget the budget snowballed into something
Above ground running not underground covered
Breath easy regulate the pace see if they love it
The Poet Laureate puppet with a message from THE OTHERS
The aura describes the forces
Im too involved to divorce it my internal compass points me northward
My skull is a submarine hull calling whales with whale song
Creating basketball size hailstorms
Water World under water war protected by the Jericho wall
With surface permutation of the permafrost
My war birds are grounded their wings have been burned off
Im not concerned though its only the first lost
Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry
Poet Laureate infinity now you know its me
Yeti riding a Triceratops with Elephant netting
Attending Black Widow weddings dressing in gossamer webbing
Pretending experimenting they call me a heretic
A derelict cherubim seraphim protecting America
Height weight eye colour skeletal structure was designed
I circle my flight instructors in the skies as they fly
22 times to show them I have plenty new rhymes
Poet Laureate will prove it to you all in due time
Dont be upset with Canibus yet the kid just want respect
You been a success but what do he get
Politics and Perjury bring out the worst in me
But I dont take it personally even though its hurting me
The key maker turns the key those observing me keep cursing me
They arent worthy of a word from me
I spit the truth Rip the mic Rip the booth Rip you too
Rip the Jacker is proof I Ripped through
It drives me insane when a woman wears lace
The current gene structure is 46 pair based
Her heart rumbling and thundering like Captain Nicole Malachowski from an
Airbase on a clear day
Ok Im a pervert Its time to fess up
I might be looking for a leg up but I wont touch
Closet sadomasochist sexual pacifist
I like to role play but I only play masculine
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
Im a giant in the industry just over 5 ft
Even my photo ID dont look like me
The NASA contractor with a satchel of answers
I passed up the Nobel Peace Prize for my passion
Democracy Rules Everything Around Me DREAM
Another fucking acronym just what I need
Killing me with phrases that were designed to put me into dazes
As worthless as my junk mail is
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The Squid Faced God is difficult to describe
Those of weak heart and mind shouldnt even try
In a town near Kadam and Kakrak Jahlalabad
I pray in a hut constructed from Sago Palm
Astoria Oregon Fisherman Poets got lost
Looking for Paradise it only exists in the heart
Cause emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions and Reality
But what is attracting me
The overseer of poetic antiquity
The Victoria and Albert Museum kept them for me
Pythagoras Dionysus Loki and Pan
They have enlightened me thru song to understand
The multiplex meshing multiple messages is too much for me
Truly there is too much to see
Ill mix one for you then one for me
Ill mix some for the street mix til my thumbs bleed
A stationary pulley drawing from a wishing well
The Genie gave me more than three because I listen well
Conflicted and confused but completely compelled
To celebrate my birthday alone in the year 2012
I hope I am not alone that would be terrible
If I am celebrating then that would be a miracle
In a newly ordered world living in shit
No matter how good or poor your English is
You lazy and you wanna be the best You crazy
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
Ermaine Will I am the name that my precious mother gave me
The world came to know me as Sir William
The man of steel with a Smallville build with the illest
Some of my thoughts align with Einstein himself
I wanna know Gods thoughts too the rest are details
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course but
The secret to creativity is hiding your sources
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
Do not blame them and hold their humanity hostage
Pray for the families that want them home
Pray for the families abroad that have lost their homes
Who have lost their faith who have lost their hope
Who have lost their point who have lost their own
Yo calm the fuck down I shouldnt have to curse at you
Hydrate as much as possible drink a lot of juice
Fucking bummer no armour inside the Hummer
Gotta hug a motherfucking sandbag for cover
Now Im self employed still gotta pay taxes
Cashless bankrupt aint got no assets
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
Cause I dont want it thats why Im rarely seen in public
President Poetry the popular obedient Pundit
Thats right you can take this job and shove it
I dictate a scribe that causes the court stenographer to die
Brewing hot tea with honey and lime
How is my driving Run you off the road smiling
1800RoadRage Start dialing
The snake will grow feet and stampede you to your defeat
You are weak you lied to us all in your speech
Symbiotic indeed the host bleeds
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Rock climbed the slope shaped like a stop sign
In record clock time Hot Lava lock rhymes rock slide topside
How does one ever really perfect such a craft
Youre obliged by your curiosity to ask
Cubism and Futurism writing amusing lyrics
My opinion of your opinion is you cant be serious
Test driving my principle findings
By designing a new style of rhyming you can take home and try out
A 100 Bars per hour sometimes I doubled the writing secret signature timing
Was the hardest part to figure out
Agonizing the pain of the migraine biting my brain
And everything inside it I cant explain but Im trying
I heard this before I cant remember who said it
We hear from 1000 to 20 thousand cycles per second
Straight out the freak show no preshow
Limited oxygen when I rhyme fast you breath slow
VFR stands for Visual Flight Rules by the Book
You should know this even though it concern the showbiz
Because when in Rome walk as a Roman
Obviously you can see youve made the wrong choice
Fraternize but dont do it in the wrong tone of voice
A bad boy with bad toys made from new alloys
Readapted from a crashed asteroid
My shelter is not far you can borrow what you need
The bunker doors sequestered beneath the tall tumble weeds
After the Matrix Agent Smith continued his movement
The same bullshit that humans are major pollutants
Assemble the Gatlin gun spin it see if it spun
Weapons check correct Im done next one
My rap room is an 8 by 14 underground base
Hyper cube microphone booth in a vacuum of space
Extraterrestrial Isotopic ratios
A broke Scientist in his Lab with no place to go
All these conscious rappers aint saying nothing
Matter fact they have no constituent function
Mix this record different youll hear me call names out
Its played out but there must be alternative routes
The Geneva Protocol Advocates are so sloppy
A human being is not anybodys property
Reading body language in a Zero Gravity environment
Is much easier said than done if your trying it
Attending the Opera with a Pompous Ego Monster
I can barely take my eyes off her big old knockers
Integrated in an existing clothing ensemble
My Saratoga Suit is Military Garment
The Quarantine Isolation Unit is where I house it
My team and I salvage the work of Dr Fritz Albert
If the prototype works theres no telling what I will do
Ill have to get a new Plane a new Pilot and a Crew
Creatively I have never been to this level
First Ill put you in a sideways 8 then a pretzel
Password please have patience verification
I repeat Whats Your Character String Verification
Infrared spectral observation from the Space Station
Before you take a break Ill need you to list and name them
Dock the Kliper Craft at the preliminary designation
Tracing the Detection of Submicron Radiation
Do not leave the Orbital Boom Sensor System running
I heard something called nothing that the Cosmonauts were coming
The rhymes are in place General George Case
And Peter Pace said we had absolutely no time to waste
Next time we meet this whole song will be a new mix
For all the Rippers out there who need a new fix
My father is Jamaican my mother is British
Raised to be civic in the household we spoke Yiddish
ELF 100 cps Elephant Hearing
Im heading for the clearing Storm Clouds appearing
On the back of an Elephant with advanced intelligence
Like Nikola Tesla shit damn thats a smart Elephant
Cease fire breach riot and loot for 3 weeks dont you see
Broke niggas never promote peace
Suzanne Malveaux will interview the polygamist Mr Bis
Undisclosed in his home by the cliffs
I rip shit consistent spit persistent
The sickness spit with conviction promote lyrical fitness
Im lost what version is this
Mozart with a flowchart putting together parts of an unknown art
But coming from my own heart
Burning a disk initializing rhyming and visualizing
Reaching 1000 Bars and climbing
Martial Law Research an all expense paid trip to the dirt
Several miles deep underneath the Earth
The Boston Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
Extraordinary men who meet to review and recommend
I attend the Gubernatorial that never ends 190
We just got a SASO we call this one the Black Hole
Im glad Im the last to go
Zionism the answer to your uncensored question
Guy de Rothschild and his bloodline brethren
Playing the guitar singing folk songs speaking my mind
Nobody could really understand the reason I rhyme
Infrared direct hit target bled proceed to inject the syringe with meds
That subsequently pinch your leg
You feel like your an inch from being dead
But you alive instead youre really dead your just living in my head
Fire for effect smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation roll out like this
I will spare no sin walk in with a scarecrow grin looking crazy
Cause thats what you made me
Classified payloads with no frequency safe modes no safety
And I still made time for the ladies
Ceiling visibility unlimited
A lyricist river fish surrounded by nigga shrimp
Im a killer pimp
Somebody Hip Hop dont need me
Nigga I grew up in DC I love Lil Weezy 210
Me and Baby got the same name
We probably got the same blood in our veins liquid propane
At the top of the Temple Mount Mosque I look at the Sun
I just have a few words for everyone
Everybody bow your heads and say this prayer
From this moment Hip Hop is united everywhere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
",you it shouldnt sound like Im quitting cause Im not If I am to continue its up to Hip Hop Weary of body and mind tired of swimming against the tide Why swim or walk when I can glide Zero Gravity exercising requires expert timing for sky diving My call sign is Flying Wing An impossible profession St Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message Now you may go You have graduated now you may know Tell the world exactly what you were shown Sho nuff sesame street poems brought to you by Sears Roebuck Countdown 48 more months Does it amaze me NO Does it phase me maybe a little yo Gotta find a way to generate doe Promoter wont pay me what I want for a show Why do it for free when Im worth my weight in gold Mind Body Soul inseparable incredibly Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually Hip Hop became boring lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ But they should be more important The diaphragm the thymus Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras You get the Guantanamo Bay the Alcatraz way You heard what I say These pigs gotta pay I steady my approach this supposed to be a no fly zone Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes The hurricanes eyes open Gale winds blowing Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean I figured out how to save water in a drought If we save the right amount I know we can make it out The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy The quantum biology biopsy My austere designs are so ahead of their time Even when you press rewind your still left behind Father Author Poor Pauper breaths to draw Prana In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama Your ear cartilage has been targeted The bombing will commence Dont be a bitch nigga you started it On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet Drawing mathematics suspended in space as holographics Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal Viable style its like trying to ride a bull The lyrical inimical is miserable because Ive built a citadel Of syllables that made me invincible Am I a mad man or a mason A patriot or a pagan West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated Im waiting on the parts special order replacements Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites Fuck all the haters My luck was crushed I felt like they fronted My heart kept pumping I had to do something I turned the page wrote a turn of phrase Verbal XRays they say I dont burn I blaze Dont look at it like winning or losing in 98 it was amusing But Poet Laureate is my New Shit Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping But right now my image stands still in a prism My light reflects like a mirror I choose to share it The Precession of Earth is nearing Im preparing Assessment and Planning things should I put mustard on these sandwiches a Fathers job is so challenging My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease You cant Emcee take a seat What are you building Bis Is it a flying Silver Disk If you ever leave youll be missed I tear thru the Galactic drift I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes Now thats some shit You think thats fast Nah Thats faster than you think By the time you blink the whole Universe shrinks A word to the wise try to keep your eyes in the skies And try to keep your ears on my rhymes A magic reminder that the fire will not expire Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when Im tired The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt Im forced to look downward Now I see inside the Earth I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass But it wont last were killing her with greenhouse gas You said the best shouldnt have to ask for respect Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES I hold Hip Hop responsible Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles Gone til November Ill be gone forever I made these bars so you could ALL remember The illest MC to put it all on the line My career was crucified but Im still alive Sky scraper spaceships wide crater dry lake beds resistance is futile they said I bear clutch the pen my girlfriends jealous again So intimate when I write its a sin 200 My electromagnetic rap flytrap Theres no way Earth you can get around that This is a no brainer stop the complaining If Hip Hop is dead Im here to save it Pages upon pages everything Ive created The bar was below basic I had to raise it I did it for my Fathers I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers I did it for the world to discover My poetry is peaceful aggressive but regal Progressive to the people I hope the words reach you 210 Dr Watson and Crick found an 3rd strand in the DNA helix So your not what you think Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum The beat is my slave and it will behave as

Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest The ramifications are awesome what should we call it I call it my unacknowledged special access project My skull is a submarine hull In a cave below ground with a painting of Cthulhu on the wall Necronomicon grimoires open the doors The vortex that reaches from here to beyond10 The power to control thoughts however remotely Through a term Id like to call Pulse Detonation Poetry The results from SETI very interesting I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testing My team was credited we turned over the evidence But not before I

wouldnt let up 30 Mommy noticed my vocabulary I developed Telencephalon olfactory lobes I had to practice When a woman has her period I smell it on the mattress It got to be difficult for any woman to live with me I know my history but what could that mean specifically The story of Bruce Lee I died in my sleep I was weak it happens with every girl that I meet A Clairvoyant Technique Using XRay refraction Not only can I see into the future I can see past it 40 But I dont know what it means I pass the DataStream along to my team They say its more than a dream Killing caused by poisonous vapours Lasers Tasers Masers Electromagnetic Scalars That is not dead which can eternally lie And with strange aeons even death may die Listen to the rhymes the rhymes equal pie If I had a piece of the pie I could buy Dubai Rip The Jacker was born the bow was drawn Spit a 100 bars before you could run 100 yards 50 I seen a mushroom to the north from my porch It was odd every dog in the neighbourhood barked You wanna stand there and talk The blast wave gonna tear more than your roof off nigga Cmon It is my understanding that when Im high Im channelling But when Im out with the family I am animal handling Observe a man who has a third DNA strand Or a 5th or a 6th this is way more advanced I remove the veil from in front of me suddenly The roots of my discovery uncovered skulduggery 60 I am not innocent but you cannot punish me Cause I know what the world wants to see tragedy What is Germaine determined to ascertain for his self Few of the same ilk have known what I felt Theres a Proverb that goes One should know thyself Before one can know the world so I showed myself The unidentified submersible looked like a giant turtle half circle Yo I need to stop smoking purple

7591,"The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah its Common Sense with DJ Premier
We gonna help yall see clear
Its real hiphop music from the soul yall
Yeah check it yo
The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
Its unseen or heard a king with words
Cant knock the hustle but Ive seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say Im too deep Im in too deep to sleep
Through me Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru thats untapped
Want to be in the rap race but aint ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you cant come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack forgot that
This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
Heeeeyyyy heeeeeyyyy
This is rap This is rap for real
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
In front of twoinch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write I see my daughters eyes
Im the truth across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie Id be theme music
My music you either fight fuck or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme I try to scheme through it
Through my shell never knew what the divine would bring to it
Id be lying if I said I didnt want millions
More than money saved I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
Im Morpheus in this hiphop Matrix exposing fake shit
And you know yes you know
This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
Heeeeyyyy heeeeeyyyy
This is rap This is rap for real
And you know yes you know
This is rap for the black people
Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th sat by this little girl
She recited raps I forgot where they was from
In em she was saying how she make brothers cum
I start thinking how many souls hiphop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge ones perspective
Though some of that shit yall bop to it I aint relating
If I dont like it I dont like it that dont mean that Im hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know Im with em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes its like
And you know yes you know
Thi This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know

Cars ride by with the boomin systems That like to front in they rides 
Cars ride by Check it out 
You know its funky funky funky cause you heard it from here see
A jam that you love that dont be gettin no airplay
Strictly for frontin when youre ridin around
Twelve oclock at night with your windows down
Headlights blinkin cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hiphop spots
Push the EQ and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side people everywhere
The trunk full of amps there aint no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cause they dont understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
Its because I want attention when Im ridin by
And the girls be on my jock cause my systems fly
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Cars ride by with the boomin systems All up at dawn 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems Just frontin 
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cause they be hear me gettin funky frequently
They tell me dont drink and drive I say What is this
Mind your business
Then pass it around
Laid back hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While Im checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
Im frontin and I dont care if you know
The back seat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise its three oclock
The girlies they smile they see me comin
Im steady hummin I got the Funky Drummer drummin
My trunk be shakin vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud all the shorties be babblin
My righthand mans here without the swing
Every chance I get Im showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cause Im frontin in my ride and my word is bond
Cars ride by with the boomin systems Frontin you know what I mean 
Cars ride by
Cars ride by with the boomin systems

Sunroof open so I can feel the wind blow

C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means Im chillin
Like Spoonie Gee said my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say I want bass
I want a hit I want a dose
Youre rollin up smilin but you cant come close
Cause my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane fight the power with PE
Tell the cops You gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin thatll break your trunk
And remember Uncle L is like the future of the funk
Cars ride by with the boomin systems Yeah thats frontin 
Cars ride by
Cars ride by with the boomin systems You know what Im sayin 
Cars ride by So next time youre in your ride pumpin it up

5668,"Man its a trip
Man its a trip turn 
Man its a trip trip trip turn 
Now as the world turns when will us black people learn damn 
Before we had a perm we came from Adams sperm
You see with plain vision we live in the same system
Cocaine victims once was able cant even raise children
Wheres the village when you need it
A question for the person in the looking glass
Our communitys lookin bad like a bucket full of crabs
Thats the crooked path
If we dont straighten this out how long would it last
Every night you hear the bullets blast
Even if you in the suburbs every night you see the footage flash
Across your screen Ill tell you my biggest pet peeve
You lookin at it thinkin like It dont affect me
You livin large Im thinkin like It dont impress me
Rockin them chains Sojourner Truth is tryin to set free
It dont take a professor
To see the opressor got the whole treasure
Now how many Africans slain for one platinum chain on yo dresser
Im no better just because I think I know better
Tell me who you trust when youre in your new trucks
Some of us dyin over a few bucks killers old enough to ride a school bus
With brothers like these tell me who needs the Ku Klux
Women walkin with titties out cause the truth sucks
Its time to breastfeed knowledge is the best key
We got us pourin liquor out for all the dead Gs
Rest Please in the grave you gettin less peace
Man its a trip Turnin turnin
The world keeps turnin
On its axis
See in America they flamed bottle rockets when slaves was not abolished true 
Slayed a lot of fathers and raped a lot of mommas
Them days cotton products we blame our modern problems
New ways they got us bondaged the chains is psychologic
The media be feedin us napalm atomics
While the schools brainwash us the crayons is toxic blah 
Dont believe the hype they can save all the drama
Cause them apes not evolving I cant swallow ya vomit
My rights as a human they change laws in congress
Now Shaytan in office we cant call him honest
What part of the game do they play cops or robbers
In this land of Pocahontas natives lost to conquest
Your false gods get framed buffed and polished
If you ask who the prophet they say Nostradamas who 
No ways of Muhammad no pray five at Kabbah
Definition of a terrorist they call Islamic
So many brothers puzzled and cant solve they problems
Smuggle crack juggle rap or play ball in college
But Uncle Sam hustle man take all your dollars
Break yall sink them 8balls in your pocket
Im chosen like Moses here to take yall to promise
My quest started when Tip say Lost my wallet
We all gotta get it the mules acres was promised
But the skeletons came out the closet
Now some of yall black folks is still patriotic
Dyin in wars so who you think make the profit
One day old fool you gonna get this country
In a war that they not gonna fight for ya
Which means you gon have to fight it yourself
What makes you think you can be a black hero
Im here cause I cant stand whats happening in this community
And somebody has to make a change
Now brotha will you help me

We spoke of was and when
Although I wasnt there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no not me
I never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago
Who knows Not me
We never lost control
Youre face to face

He sat me on the porch said This where little dogs sit
Pointed at the yard yard said Thats where big dogs shit shit 
He said Dont leave til your ass get growed
And dont come back til your ass get throwed
Whatever you want is whatever you can have
Bring the pain and leave em wet like they soaking in some salve

Make sure they wanna see ya wanna see ya 
Cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
Be about it like a G a hater wanna catch you slipping

The desert sand mound a burial ground

Are we partners in crime
When it comes to the time
Well be ready to die
God let us go now
And finish whats to be done
Thy Kingdom come
Thy shall be done on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves
The reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive
But how can we let them go on this way

And we know deep down
Theres no other way

Its all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe its true
Its a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
But you can take the crosstown bus
If its raining or its cold
And the animals will love it
If you do
If you do now
Something tells me
Its all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe its true
The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but theyre dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum
Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas You gotta come and see

7323,"Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder
Whats the date and time it dont matter
Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort
To make a long story short
Ran into this girl named Carla
Knew her from the back seat of my homies Impala
She said whats up yeah whats the deal
Check the hairdo of course it aint real
Then I looked down she was fat in the front
I asked how long Well about seven months
Oh how time flies when youre having fun
She said Yeah but the damage is done
Where you been On a little vacation
Oh by the way congratulations
Whos the lucky man I dont have a clue
Then she said The lucky man is you I dropped my brew
And everything looked fuzzy
Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy
She said Yeah remember that date
I thought back and tried to calculate
Then I said Damn are you sure its mine
Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times
She said That day no I wasnt whoring
Your ass is mine thats when the sweat started pouring
Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court
Paying a gang on child support
Then I thought deep about giving up the money
What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy
Naw cause then Id really get faded
Thats murder one cause it was premeditated
So what Ima do I dont have a clue
How many months left damn only two
Im gettin faded
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
No cigar G
Ay yo homey man Im getting faded
Its crazy cause before I could sleep with her
I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her
See the booty and the front was all in place
But the girl had the pitbull face
So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid
Oh lord god forbid
My homies see me at the motel
Cause those fools would love to just go tell
Everybody in the hood that knows your rep
So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept
And hold your big fat butt steady
Cause yo ho I got the paper bag ready
She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey
I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque
I dropped her off man and Im knowing
That Im a hate myself in the morning
I got drunk to help me forget
Yo another day another hit shit
Im gettin faded
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
Ay yo you know what time it is
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in Whoa yeah 
Nine months later shes ready to drop the load
And everybody in the hood already knows
Its supposed to be mine so they laughing at me
You know Ice Cube cant be having that G
Im thinking to myself why did I bang her
Now Im in the closet looking for the hanger
JD and Jinx and TBone wont let up they wont shut up
Im gettin fed up bitch
Cause I know youre tryin to break me
But if I find out your tryin to fake me
Im a buff that duff and hoot
Beat ya down and leave a crown or two
That night she went into labor
And the shit is getting kinda major
The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver
Looking like my nextdoor neighbor
She said it was mine that was her best guess
But lets check the results of the blood test
I started smiling yeah cause it read negative
Damn why did I let her live
After that I shouldve got the gat
And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap
But no I just told the ho who laid me
Excuse me bitch its a switch
You cant fade me
Naw baby not this way
Yo you aint playing Ice Cube out like no booger
I dont fall for the okeydoke
And before I fall for the okeydoke I let the pistol smoke
Now sing it
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in 
Ha ha yeah baby you cant fade me
Livin and jivin and diggin the skin hes in Whoa yeah

Yeah its my life
In my own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for
Not the expression no literally give an arm for
When they know theyre your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain

Snake pit youre venom beyond measure

If love is strong as the grave make me deader
Jezibelle got my soul and my cheddar

Learned to suck good dick by fuckin thugs
A nigga cant teach you spread like a track meet
Breaking Dboys MCs and athletes but not me
Told you from the start this shit forever

Whether low road or high side we gon ride
Through the fistfights and black eyes its you and I
Ike and Tina our love is measured on a milimeter
They say a partner dont love a nigga til a nigga eat her
But Im full and tired of the motherfuckin talking
Ill be goddamned if you hit the door walking
Im stalkin the depths of Atlantis evil enchantress
Slick and underhanded
Fuckin with you like dancing with the devil no command bitch
Known for leaving niggas emptyhanded
I lost everything I had just to lust you

Niggas talk shit til they get lockjaw

Lets take it to the basics you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces aint no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it thats just a understatement
Im early to the party but my Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Lifes a mothafucka aint it These other rappers aint us
So tell me what your name is Ima tell it to my stainless
You aim it fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
Its just me myself and I and mothafuckas that I came with

Hey listen dont you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and thats not right
Theyre playing out a game that draws you closer
Till youre living in a world thats ruled by fear
Always taking baby but thats okay
What theyre giving maybe its out of phase with me
Told you once youre never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face
We are screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then youre pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All youre praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load
We are screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I dont talk about it but thats all right
Tables turned now theres a revenge in sight
If it takes forever then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hells own gate
We are screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Screaming vengeance screaming
",your body breaking up Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode Got to fight the horror of this mental load We are screaming screaming for vengeance The world is a manacled place Screaming screaming for vengeance The world is defiled in disgrace So you wait it out and bide your time Rip off that straight jacket you gotta break that line Everyone who wins in the great escape Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake I dont talk about it but thats all right Tables turned now theres a revenge in sight If it takes forever then I tell you I can wait Send them screaming back through their hells own gate We are screaming screaming for vengeance The world is a manacled place Screaming screaming for vengeance The world is defiled in disgrace Screaming screaming vengeance Screaming vengeance screaming,Ahhhhhh Hey listen dont you let them get your mind Fill your brain with orders and thats not right Theyre playing out a game that draws you closer Till youre living in a world thats ruled by fear Always taking baby but thats okay What theyre giving maybe its out of phase with me Told you once youre never gonna win the race Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face We are screaming screaming for vengeance The world is a manacled place Screaming screaming for vengeance The world is defiled in disgrace Tie a blindfold all around your head Spin you round in the torture before the dread And then youre pushed and shoved into every corner Then they lead you out into the final slaughter As the sweat is running down your neck All youre praying for is to stop
304,"Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war
I dreamed I saw a mighty room
The room was filled with men
And the paper they were signing said
Theyd never fight again
And when the papers all were signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed
And the people in the streets below
Were dancing round and round
And guns and swords and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground
Last night I had the strangest dream
I ever dreamed before
I dreamed the world had all agreed
To put an end to war

Its okay in the day Im staying busy
Tied up enough so I dont have to wonder Where is he
Got so sick of crying so just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180
I stay up clean the house at least Im not drinking
Run around just so I dont have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets
Hes fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
As far as my heart Id rather be restless
Second I stop the sleep catches up and Im breathless
Cause this ache in my chest cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold I stand before him Before him 
Its all I can do to assure him Assure him 
When he comes to me I drip for him tonight
Drowning me we bathe under blue light Under blue 
Hes fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone

693,"Love can change a young boy into a man
But a broken heart can change a man back into a boy again
Youre not the first man to cry when things have gone wrong
Youre only human youre only so strong
It takes more than a tear to knock a big man down
It takes more broken hearts to keep him down on the ground
It takes three little words to make him stand again
So cry
Go ahead and cry cry
Love is so easy to play but so hard to read
Youre still a young man your heart will love again
It takes more little kiss from her sweet tender lips
It takes more gentle touch from her soft finger tips
It takes more than one tear to mend a broken heart
So cry
Go ahead and cry cry
Go ahead and cry
Dont be ashamed to cry cry

Bloods and Crips talkin shit and straight schemin
Olde English Starter caps and gold daytons
Goldplated hearing Bones Jheri curl activator
And the party started crackin
And this dude in the background who looked familiar started dancing
But I dont know he seemed dope
The whole party was like he hadnt rapped in the east coast
Lyrical physical very artistical
Give the party people something funky to listen to
Step up if you wanna get hurt
Step Step up if you wanna get hurt
All you MCs are some riders
All you need is a line
Til you change and rearrange
And then what happened this time
I checkmate terminate never late contemplate
Mind state is never fake hesitate you lose
There was this group in the cypher called Das FX
And a Tribe Called Quest
QTip was searchin for his wallet sayin somebody got him
10 dollars sayin it was someone from Compton
LL was on the side of the kangol talkin about his Momma
Sayin that if anyone stepped
Theyd get knocked out He promised
Watching ButterPecan Ricans licking their ice cream
Ghostface did lines and Bees that were lime green
liquorice and a dutch
I hit that shit once and then passed out off the blunt
I woke up in struggle for breath by Nas
He said sleep was the cousin of death my God
Door busted down and I thought it was the cops
It was 2Pac saying that he had just gotten shot
Stood up out the wheel chair said fuck this city
Grabbed a Cristal bottle pointed it at Biggie
Puff jumped up was like take that one
The whole party stopped and said
2Pac left the party with Suge in the lac
Nobody ever thought that Pac would never come back
An hour later Big and Puff left
Big said he was ready to die but thered be life after his death
Craziest shit Ive ever been to the wildest venue
But it wasnt over yet the party must continue
Yeah Yeah I said continue
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Pink gators my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know I flow some old funky shit
Crucial lyrical style aint what it used to
Microphone check one two echo 
For some this is where the party began
Some say its where the party was crashed
There was a new room a new dude named Shady in the Aftermath
Hi my name is what it was that everybody started to want to rap
Rock fans from the other parties put down their guitar straps
And started writing their bars on a pad
The burbs were already in the building
And the media been feeling if another party was on smash
Pepsi endorsements Spike Cocacola
Was tellin the whole world where the party was at
The line to get in it wasnt just around the building
It was around New Zealand and the underground was making chat
Saying it was wack remember the art the heart they taking it back
But it was too late for that they started making scratch the line
Complaining about the game was saying its wack
Hold up half the people that were dissing it
Were half the reason that the party was so big
And everyone in line was out there trying to get respect
And then the party got put on the internet
Shit
They bumrushed the door
You couldnt move anymore
There wasnt room on the floor
And out came the neighbors
Getting on TV and complaining about the noise
Bill OReilly and Oprah came down and they started hating
The venue wasnt making money cause no one was paying
Unless you had Lil Wayne or TPain in the room
Nas came down and said the party was dead
Somebody lit a match all you heard was a

It would be reckless of me to try
Cause its mystified man ever since time began
But hold on to your hat and Ill try
Love is like a burning arrow
It can pierce the coldest heart
Love is warm love is patient
And the craziest thing youll ever start alright
I recall when I was a young man
A day Im never allowed to forget
There was a girl that I met who I dreamed I would wed
Forever our lives entwined
She said You gotta stop worrying about the future
You know were far too young for that
I wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring
I never saw her pretty face again
Love is life love is yearning
It does not boast but speaks the truth
Love is fair and knows no boundaries
And the craziest thing youll ever do oh yeah
Come on now
I wish you well in all of your travels
And may you find what youre searching for
Itll hit you like thunder when you find one another
And stay in your heart forevermore
Love is like a fourleaf clover
Hard to find and hold onto
Love is blind love is tender
And the craziest thing youll ever do
So crazy

Say she want to eat sushi I gave her enough to go shoppin
Anything she wantâsheâcashin out withoutâno problems
How you gon love aânigga that aint got love for your mama
You can die today it aint gon save me nothin but drama Super 
Workin on a weekend like usual

Niggas swear they passed us they doin too much
Havent done my taxes Im too turnt up

Help me fight my demons off know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar she didnt wanna leave
Treat her like garbage my heart was on my sleeve
Shouldve chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep
Why should I have trust for you You aint get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you You aint kneelin to my feet
Why should I be carin when I know I cant be beat
See how the ice be glarin when I come through and retrieve
Its easy to know its us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket you niggas beneath me
Who causin a racket in Jamaica on the weekend
Half a ticket on vacation I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy cause my money long like Stevie

7186,"Aiyyo heres a tale about a female I once messed with
Or better yet skins that I swung eps with
Face full of grace waist shaped like Vanessa Del Rio ohmeoh my but the heffer had
Big juicy lips wide hips you had to call fat
Stacked back to mack yo the hooker was all that
And lots more and baby girl I had the hots for
But Im really not sure who she spread the twat for
Heard it was a kid across town named Hector
But I dont give a heck so I still went and checked her
On the down low he aint around so
Out of sight out of mind get your coat and lets go
So we dipped hopped in the whip and we was gone
Off to City Island cause they had it goin on
Two yuks a foo now the mood was set
Caviar at the bar Red Star Moet
Silk suits spendin loot like a straight up mack
When I felt somebody finger tappin me on my back
And turn around quick but before I could begin
All I seen was a big mac10 aiyyo its her boyfriend
Hooker got a boyfriend
Why do she do this boyfriend
Ohh ahhh why do she do this boyfriend
Check it yo
I broke camp ran like a champ yep I jetted
Off to the trunk for the pump time to set it
Money kept screamin some CRAP that I dissed him
So I started lettin off gunshots but I missed him
Honey got scared and called the fiveoh
So yo you know the half Dukes time for me to go
Cause I aint the type to be doin no bid
For a dame or a lamebrained punk Spanish kid
So I chill call the hooker up the next day
She told me come over yo bet Im on my way
Be there in a sec yo Im not too far
She said Park around the back so he dont see the car
Met me at the door with a kiss and a smile
I said Sorry about last night money kinda wild
Umm yeah I know small thing dont worry
Just show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry
Kissed her from her earlobes down to her chest
Went for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest
Got her buttnaked and before a second passed
I had her on the bed with my fingers up her ahh
Now shes ready set for a good steady bangin
Until she looked down and seen Moby Dick hangin
She told me Take it easy yo trust me just chill
Knowin once I get up in it yo Im goin for the kill
So she spread em thick rich and creamy like mayo
Aiyyo layo the tip is on the wayo
Pinned her legs back just about to slide in
When the door burst open SLAM damn its her boyfriend
Did it again
Now Im mad money done spoiled all the fun
On top of that he beefin and he aint got a gun
Flippin the jibs I guess he wanted to brawl
So I started hookin all buttnaked and all
Threw a right caught money dead in the jaw
BOOM with the left and his fronts hit the floor
Now I had him time to put his head for rest
So I beat him unconcious and I started gettin dressed
Honey all hysterical and screamin all hoarse
Said she seen a box car pullin up in the yard
Just bout to jet yo guess what I saw
Some old big black HMMM bust in the door
Now hold up what the hell you doin in my house
Get your ass off the floor put your teeth in your mouth
Now everybody better be gone by the count of one
Look better yet yall stay right here
Im goin to get my gun
Now thats it Enough is enough I aint with it
Im catchin mad beef and yo I aint even hit it
Honey looked good and yo the buns was fat
But aint a coochie in the whole WORLD worth all that
So umm I got my coat and I was on my way
Thats when she started breakin down and beggin me to stay
Knock it off it aint that much beggin in the world
Next time I want some skins Ill go and hit my own girl
Man Im out and I aint tryin to see you again

Now in ninetythree Im still bein me
You think my fridgerator aint full of Olde E Huh
A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches
And I dont try to act brand new

The ghetto life Ive seen a lot overcome
Make a little money and then forget where they came from
Livin a plastic lifestyle youre more false than dentures

So why you wanna be what youre not
And claim to have things that you know you aint got
Youre just a fantasizer spendin all your money
On Lusters pink oil moisturizer
Just to make your hair curly and thin
You say Black is beautiful but then you go and bleach your skin
Money youre worse than Yacub
Cause their are eight stages of graft and you broke down to two
Plus you got a bad case of jungle fever
And nmmananahnah I just cant believe ya
Its quite obvious you dont wanna be a black man
So whats next youre gonna join the Klu Klux Klan
You sold out to your race and its a big disgrace
You cant look your own people in the face
You wonder why it aint no black schools or hospitals
Youre makin millions of dollars and its pitiful
That you can donate to leukemia all the time
But you cant give the Nation of Islam a dime
They mention Muslims you change the subject
You cant even shake Farrakhan hand in public
That whole busy attitude is a sham

Howd you get to be the woman pleaser
Cause I remember when girls didnt notice me
And now they wanna Come and Talk To Me like Jodeci
Its strange how back in the days I couldnt get with em
Now all of a sudden the honies they wanna give me rhythm
Well Ima hit it but still I show no pity
So I hope you dont think you gonna be in my next video
And many brothers I never even ran with
Be actin like they been hangin with me since I was a kid

If you dont know the time its time to act now
Ayo my pen uncontrollable notepads are over Lo
Going up these quotables to move up the totem pole
Would rob a hood I pay dues with stolen shows
Wax pads thats harder than cast over the broken bones
And gristle officially swing ropeadope
Butterfly floating and bees stinging you swollen dome kings
On the throne like rats on cheese provolone
Soandso selling your soul genes and chromosome
Blood sweat and tears for what appears to never be treasury
Haters get mad green incredibly
All over the globe emcees the same destiny
Same bit of taste most reckon its the same recipe
Sugar coated sex drugs violence aim the weaponry
Blasphemy amahkiyama this weighs heavily
How you gonna battle the truth I say let it be
I came to bless the seeds on streets that aint Sesame

Sometimes you dont understand how I could kill a man
Violence in his plans no time for ill advance
Guerrilla hands go to war before you get a chance to score
You wanna battle kid Ill damage your pride
Make you feel like when planets collide travelling time
Centuries before the Africans was sent to get beat
To cave blocks play the hard rock Ill chisel you deep

So tremendous gang members run to the cops snitching

Make the question known but you let it go
The point is you want something you need to let me know
Dont start buggin this forced me to call the pest control

8106,"A Message from Yasiin Bey Lyrics
Peace this is Yasiin
No more parties in SA
Please tell em no more parties in SA
Aint home arrest I dont need to stay
Ill leave and Ill stay away
I committed no crime any place
Why these police up in my face
Why they raiding my place
Why I dont feel safe
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
My intentions are pure in coming here
And thats for everything I love or hold dear
Umis in the building
So is my wife and my children
I committed no crime
Why is the state wasting my time
They must be out of their minds
I forgive em thats the spirit of divine
I just wanna go where Im wanted
Where Im loved stop frontin
Where I live is my choice you cannot mute my voice
Thank you Kanye West for being a real friend a real friend
A real friend
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SA
I heard your choice the first time Ill go away
And when I leave thats exactly where Ill stay
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
A country called Earth everywhere
A country called Earth everywhere
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SAThats just a freestyle I had to let that out Peace to all fear none this is Yasiin Bey At this present time I am currently in Cape Town South Africa and Im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason Theyre saying that they want to deport my family Uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious which it is not Anyone can do the research about the world passport its not a fictitious document It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all In fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015 You can see the stamps theyre there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate To quote Lil Durk I am not a liar Ive made no false claims I have not misrepresented myself Im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way Im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also umIts curious I havent broken any law and Im being treated like a criminal I know Im not unique in that regard and I am grateful that Im here with my family I havent been physically harmed or anything like that However I have been detained People in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily Theres no reason I have to spend any time in the cell Theres no reason I had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all This is not an administration of justice and all I seek is to leave the state Im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because Im not I just wanna go home and I dont live in America and I have the right to domicile wherever I please without fear or without interference
The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily And thats fine we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either My family and I are prepared immediately to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state never to return to this state again We dont have to be here Were not pining to be here and were complying in every possible way reasonably Just today state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family and they had no right to do so I have legal representation here who they could easily contact Theyre contravening and breaking all types of international law and its untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on And I know its been a lot of chatter about whats going on you know people are running to the press because thats justyou know a money making machine So its another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera some telenovella and I have no interest in it Furthermore related but not directly related to this Im retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today and also from Hollywood effective immediately I am releasing my final album this year Umand thats that
Peace to all fear of none Thank everyone for their time Much success to you even if you wish me the opposite as Nas said And Im on the side of the right so people could wish however they want but I aint nobodysI aint no threat or a hazard to nobody I really try to mind my business What people think about me is none of my business and Im not here to change peoples opinions about me You dont have to like me you dont have to like everything that I say The fact is is that I have hurt no one I have injured no parties and all I require as is my lawful right is innocent passage to my domicile That is all
In summary I will say this I will close with a simple prayer To the one who has created the all you know me better than I know myself and I know myself better than people know me So forgive me for whatever they know or do not know Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said Ameen ameen allahumma ameen

all fear none this is Yasiin Bey At this present time I am currently in Cape Town South Africa and Im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason Theyre saying that they want to deport my family Uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious which it is not Anyone can do the research about the world passport its not a fictitious document It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all In fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015 You can see the stamps theyre there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate To quote Lil Durk I am not a liar Ive made no false claims I have not misrepresented myself Im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way Im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also umIts curious I havent broken any law and Im being treated like a criminal I know Im not unique in that regard and I am grateful that Im here with my family I havent been physically harmed or anything like that However I have been detained People in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily Theres no reason I have to spend any time in the cell Theres no reason I had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all This is not an administration of justice and all I seek is to leave the state Im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because Im not I just wanna go home and I dont live in America and I have the right to domicile wherever I please without fear or without interference The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily And thats fine we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either My family and I are prepared immediately

Dripping from the downpour of your insecure typhoon

5855,"Im Sorry Ms Jackson 50 Cent diss Lyrics
When its all said and done After they said Ive won
All Im going to say is
Im sorry Ms Jackson Hey 
I am for real Lets go 
Never meant to make your daughter cry Uhuh 
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson Sensitive ass nigga yeah 
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Tried to diss kiss to the world
And its your fault cause she said she saw you kissing a girl
The hood was behind her for her whole career
But now theyve slightly starting to disappeared
Something about that
Shes always angry
Might have been when them girls trying to push her scalp back
Needed some head room
So she went out and bought Tysons mansion with 18 bedrooms
Shes a domestic boss
That dont leave no marks though you got to digest those scars
In fact think you got to tell her to get back
Because every kiss rap is similar to a bitch slap
Too hard since way back in the school yard
Shes hollywood though all she needs is a boobjob
Girl in the bubble didnt mean to trouble her
Man but im a Calico im double her
Really think you should tell her to chill cause
My resume is longer than a doctor bill was
I did the song with ja rule bigging the city up
She did the magic stick remix with olivia
She got more money but I get busier
Think somebody going to end up killing her
When its all said and done
After they said Ive won
All Im going to say is
Im sorry Ms Jackson
I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson

Never meant to make your daughter cry

Hood had love for this bitch
Cause she came from south side queens with a thug ass click
Bitch got change and she changed
Now she dont fuck with the hood probably give a nigga brains
Bitch got boogie on a nigga
Went from the hood to hollywood got a movie on a nigga
Bitch talking greasy like new york sting
Sucking down south dick thats some new york thing
And the bitch used to be cool hood even liked the bitch
We used to listen to her gettin the weed
She had stories of many men times in the club and niggas that was wanksta but the truth was to see
Bitch aint shyt she was real good at bluffing it
Ordered protection on the niggas she was fucking with
Now thats a ho that you just cant trust
Hired cops thats a ho that you just cant touch
Bitch moved out new york when they were swinging them Glocks
Bitch got a deep voice but she would be singing a lot
Bitch would sell her soul just to get on the charts
Want to front like shes gangsta but she got no heart
And she going to get hit by the mac and
All in the back and this time i bet the jaw will be cracking
Shes going to get broken to fractions d block is the faction
All i can say is im sorry ms jackson

You will not be able to plug in turn on and cop out
You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials
Because the revolution will not be televised
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one
Now everybody sayin that they number one
Ring the alarm the caterpillar keeps firing
Ohh we in the war where butterflies keep dyin Ahh 
Im a product of Parker Lewis and Kubiak
If I didnt do this where in the fuck would you be at
See theres a difference between us what I spit hit arenas
You a drip from my penis I eat lions and sip hyenas
You number one when it come to slaughtering mics
Im tryna be number one in my son and daughter life
Uhh all you niggas my little rapper babies
Yall my children yall bit my shit and contracted rabies
Dont you grade me next to these rappers baby thats degrading
My style got so many different facets
I switch into so many different passions
Im skippin class to be fascinatin
My pen is like Big Ben this shits just a classic waiting
Your favorite rapper come at me I just decapitate him
I hate congratulating these hasbeens who had their highs
These rappers only won their matches because they strategize
I bring Attica to these patterns and heres my battle cry
Ring the alarm the caterpillar is firing
Ohh we in the war where butterflies keep dyin Ahh 
This right here for the number one
Number ones here with your number one
You aint number one just another one

Kid think your number wont quit
Number one song get your number one chick
Number one fly with your number one kick
When its all done then your number gon switch
Hold up wait a minute
Guess what Ima never do Show so much respect to you
That I feel like were friends so now we no longer competitors
That could be the death of you
Never let someone whos not as smart as you
Gas you up and tell you somethin you never knew
Always stay professional you always gon make revenue
Dont let people next to you that dont want the best for you
Its completely normal to hold on to a regret or two
I do what I wanna do they do what I let them do
Everything these niggas be sayin is a fuckin lie
Its nothing I can say to you that is realer
Remember when you praisin the butterfly
Dont you ever disrespect the fuckin caterpillar

Youre looking at Attila the psychopathic killer the caterpillar
Dont tell me when Im supposed to rap until
Especially when your favorite rapper aint even half as ill
A savage still the tracks a banana peel attack of the silverback gorilla
Youre havin a little trouble fathomin this is actually happenin
Like Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half
And then had the shit hangin by a flap of skin
After he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again
Pad to pen Im batty like eyelids when theyre blinkin a lot
You copy me but youre not
You cant be butterflies my offsprings are just moths
I see that thing Ima squash it and rip the wings of it off
So ring the alarm pull the extinguishers off of the wall
Set the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
Till the shingles come off the roof well shout at the ceiling
Slaughterhouse in the building middle fingers aloft
Say what I think when I rhyme in inkpen I talk
And the language I speak is my mind
Kingpin and Penguin combined
Spit like its King of the Dot
A singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart
The frauds from the cream of the crop
Wait a minute Hold up like a flashcard
Damn dawg is that copyin or payin homage
Its sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler
My dad is your grandfather Ill have to rehatch on you
Come back as a black wasp half yellow jacket you cant swat a
Sasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it
Smash it and stand on it dammit I cant stop it
The rap is a vag and Im goin in like a tampon in this bitch
Its a manslaughter
Stampin out grasshoppers you cant be no Rap Gods
In fact youre exact opposites you make a wack song
And cant hold a candle but even Danielsan whacks off
You jackoffs need to come to grips like a hand job
The boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap
Lumberjack with a hacksaw
Number one but my pencils are number twos
Cause thats all I dos with em poop is my pseudonym
On the john like a prostitute when Im droppin a deuce
And when Im producing them lyrical bowel movements
These beats are like my saloons
Cause these bars always got my stools in em
And I dont need Metamucil to loosen em
Bitch shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
Im bout to go spin another cocoon
Then Im cuttin you from your mothers womb
Then Im flushin you

7260,"Tony Story Pt 2 Lyrics
Paulie killed Tony right Right 
And Tony killed Ty so it was only right Right 
Thinkin back twenty years they was homies tight
Sixth grade for the love of the paper aint nothin nice Uhuh 
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles blowing paper balling hard he know they hating
But they gon respect it cause he rocked Tony Tony 
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding they ready to fall for him They ready 
Cause word on the street that Paulie did that That 
Used Key gold digging ass to get back Back 
Text him through her phone found out where he live at Yeah 
She woke up in the morning like I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth fitting to start a war
Cause Tonys little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law Lord 
And Paulie on a rise now On a rise 
Niggas that played the middle pickin sides now Pickin sides now 
Plus he heard Tonys brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head he gotta die now I want this nigga dead 
Paulies youngest on the corner
Tonys little brother he slipping yeah hes a goner
Fuckin with that lean he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too reachin bet you they get up on him
The gat jam he bang back tryna avoid em
Them niggas dumpin he get up running and hittin on em
He hit the alley get a body he dipping on em
Said its on now try and kill em its war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feelin like he dead it aint no remorse now
Gettin high and he thinking bout kicking in doors now Get on the floor 
Momma and little kids get on the floor now Ah 
Finger on the trigger he feel it its going down Ooh 
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain its really gon pour down
And its raining like Katrina he got thirty in his Nina Strapped 
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his Bimmer Thirty

Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Uh
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Good dude I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel firstclass to change the forecast
Never in bunches just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
Its been months since I checked back in
Were somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain four and change Armor Alld down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I cant let you know it pride wont let me show it
Pretend to be heroic thats just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry uh
Cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
On repeat the CD of Bigs Me My Bitch
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin Let me see that clip
Shopping sprees pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
Thats when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine I dont know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick let me see thats it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldnt touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbedout buggy
And then they got fuzzy and they dont remember that
And I dont remember you
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah I seen em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
A face of stone was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then
You have given away without gettin at me
Thats your fault how many times you forgiven me
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me
I know the way a nigga livin was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Shit Im a man with pride you dont do shit like that
You dont just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You dont throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin them girls I was gon get right back
They say you cant turn a bad girl good
But once a good girls gone bad shes gone forever
Ill mourn forever
Shit Ive got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Its just me against the world baby
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy
Stress in the city the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin there aint no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Cant reach the children cause theyre illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin but will they last or be blasted
Hardheaded bastard maybe hell listen in his casket
The aftermath more bodies bein buried
Im losin my homies in a hurry theyre relocatin to the cemetery
Got me worried stressin my visions blurry
The question is will I live no one in the world loves me
Im headed for danger dont trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever Im feelin this anger
Dont wanna make excuses
Cause this is how it is whats the use
Unless were shootin no one notices the youth
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Its just me against the world
Its just me against the world
Me against the world
Cause its just me against the world baby Hey 
Me against the world Ooh yeah 
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
I got nothin to lose
Could somebody help me Im out here all by myself see
Ladies in stores Baby Capones livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what Im dreamin
Seein Daddys semen full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw
Veteran a villain a young thug who one day shall fall
Everyday theres mo death and plus Im doughless
Im seein more reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the schemin and leave they peeps grievin
Cause aint no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up Im about to act up
Go load the MAC up now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts but yo it aint workin
And evils lurkin I can see him smirkin when I gets to pervin
So what Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin sales riskin 25 with a L but oh well
Me against the world
With nothin to lose Ooh yeah 
Its just me against the world
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world
Its just me against the world baby
With nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression
They punish the people thats askin questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress to make it stop study your lessons
Dont settle for less even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Dont ever change keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best dont let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things dont go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
Politicians are hypocrites they dont wanna listen
If Im insane its the fame made a brother change
It wasnt nothin like the game its just me against the world
Me against the world
Nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game Ooh yeah 
Its just me against the world
Nothin to lose

4626,"Im obsessed with multiple nude photographs
Of the beat in my room on the wall
Pondering the verses fondling my balls
Witness a nigga who will take rap and chase it
Through unoccupied dimly lit staircases and rape it
Grab the drums by the waistline
I snatch the kick kick the snares and sodomize the bassline
Never waste time I give the verse rabies
Cum on the chorus tell the hook to swallow my babies
Maybe I might switch let the witch live
The original plan was to kill the bitch on the bridge
Ditch the body parts off somewhere near the crescendo
When my innuendos elapse my mental window attacks
The instrumental elapses
Perhaps thats the only reason that I spared her life
You could solo my fucking vocals and I still get trife
Slice the rhythm disfigure the face of the groove
For any fader that flies or knobs or button that moves
Consider this the loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole a vicious cycle of sin
That doesnt end til I stop fuckin
A million emcees and they aint saying nothing
Aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it like me
She had the nerve to take the case to court
Knowing I rape for sport
Took the stand crying denying her whole involvement lying
Why would an excop lie in a sex shop fly
Linen down grinning with my coat over my shoulder sitting
Browsing pornography uh 
The stenographer smiling the whole time
While jotting verbal photography
Her eyes mahogany I flashed to a photo
In my mind of a body bludgeoned with slashed arteries
Pardon me back to the case slap in the face
Examining the jury similar to cracking a safe
What happens to bass It was an instinct
I would inhale eighths
Sniff that sat her ass all over my face to taste it
To hell with 1980 remixes fuck disco
Turned on the 3000 stuck my dick where the disc go
Yokonaz ripped the sexy MPC 60
Buying a ticket to hell verbally dicking the 12 down
Sound shitty I knew she used to be gritty
Too many impotent emcees in this Godforsaken city
Aint fucking it right aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it like me
Consider this loops are similar to clitorises exposed
On your miss is a hole a vicious cycle of sin
That doesnt end til I stop fuckin
A million emcees and they aint saying nothing
Aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right
They aint fucking it right they aint fucking it right

6527,"Too easy man cant a motherfucker round you see me
Youd need a AK and a genie a whole POUND of wheaties
My heart so freezy 3d birdie to the click you claim
Victorys my valentine Im in a different lane
Strong as cocaine
Long as Im sane I wont be took for games
I can guarantee when its over you wont look the same
Drownin in shame callin my names like callin Candy Man
Suicide on a platter splatter your brain he banned
Understand this aint a obstacle its comical
The shades you wear been blindin you
Everyone knows what Imma do
Everyone knows Im lava fool
Bet he come more phenomenal
Deadly ready for drama
Whoever want it can climb in too
Broken egos I promise you desert eagles and llamas threw
Wwhy would you ffuck wit me sstupid move
Ccome around get fffound beat up and bruised
You need support a couple crews
Beef out here aint nothin new Ill make you sleep uncomfortable
Nightmares of PO punchin you flatline
Doctor pumpin you the blind could see the punk in you
Girl in you bitch in you I will kick thru all of you
Football wit you soccer when we see him DDT him
Leave him bleedin well be even
Even thru coppin and pleading
He been talkin bout the weight he push
Use to punch the clock in jail drove his mama car round
Now he got whatchu want for sale
See it I bought it its official if I flaunt it
If ya diamond really real then put the diamond tester on it
He dont want it
Ill run up on his shadow hit him proper
He bout real as a 4 dollar bill Carol City Copper
Chop em down one by one two by two this what I do
If you knew what I knew then youll be cool youll be thru
He makin money Well we makin money too whoopee doo
Well be here long after he disappear this is proof
151 in the booth so slipperyson is the truth
Come get me Im in the coupe
4fizzy Im in the loop wit Biggie piece of fruit CAKE
They dont want no problems watch they boots SHAKE
Tremble terrified now its too LATE
Theres no stoppin till I see empires crumble beside me
Entire families divided diggin ya hole is my hobby
Ya sorry probably the weakest shit to try me
I be everywhere the guap be and ya fat musty and sloppy
Freeway Ricky Ross copy and the real ones comin home
Peace to him fuckyou
Click Pop pop pop Im gone

Quiet storm when I perform
When I get on Im like BIG Pac L reborn
Word to mama word is bond
Long kiss goodnight the pistol tight my clip too tight
You superthug Im kryptonite
Sleep wit me ya bitch just might
Same promotion different fight
Still ballin poppin bottles my wrist is white
Drive the cars that bitches like this is like
Practice pay ya taxes

Aaask around Im in brackets with legendary rappers
Rrratchets as we taxi ask me if I give a fuck ffuckem ALL

Nas is like 
Freedom or jail clips inserted a babys bein born
Same time a man is murdered the beginnin and end
As far as rap go its only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty but times have changed
Ask me now Im the artist but hardcore my signs for pain
I spent time in the game kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot flatline am I sane
That depends carry MAC10s to practice my aim
On rooftops tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin large takin it light
Pushin big toys gettin nice enjoyin your life
Its what you make it suicide few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell rap legend presence is felt
And of course NAS are the letters that spell Nas Nas Nas 
Nas is like life or death Im a rebel
My poetrys deep I never fell
Nas is like halfman halfamazin Uh

Nas is like Earth Wind Fire rims and tires
Bulletproof glass inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit line em up with the stars
Tarot cards you can see the pharaoh Nas
Nas is like Iron Mike messiah type
Before the Christ after the death the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex ownin acres
From the projects with no chips to large cake dough
Dimes givin fellatio siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But whats it all worth Cant take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried but none of it worked
They just rob your grave Id rather be alive and paid
Before my numbers called historys made
Somell fall but I rise thug or die
Makin choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill Im wonderin why
Its a dirty game is any man worthy of fame
Much success to you even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later well all see who the prophet is
Nas is like life or death Im a rebel

Im like beef bustin heat through your windows
Im like a street sweeper green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt learnin somethin deep from they teachers
Im like crime like your 9 your man you would die for
Always got you Im like Pac dude you would cry for
Im like a whole lot of loot Im like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
Im like ecstasy for ladies
Im like all races combined in one man like the 99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
Im like bein locked down around new faces and none of em fam
Im the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand
Im a poor mans dream a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Yall know what Im like yall play it in ya system every night now

You know what Im sayin what makes me a demon is lust a girl crazy and thats why I couldnt keep my wife
You know what Im sayin and thats the lust demon livin within me
And uh but my heart love big you know what Im sayin so
I know a lot of demons come to my shows as well as angels
You know what Im sayin a lot of demons
When I was one anda two anda three anda four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an ittybitty demon
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no 
Can I kill it Hell no Can I kill it Hell no 
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no 
Can I kill it Hell no Can I kill it Hell no 
Yo it make me wanna drink a lot go up in the pink with naught
This the reason I aint at ease and currently on the brink of pop
This the reason I sit at the window with the millie
Wishing a nigga gon come break in
It is the reason I be freaking a woman deeper
Loving making her silly because I done they friends
It is the reason I bang it is definitely the reason I slang
Distributed the caine
The reason Im supersoaking in the pain and starting to love it
Its wanting to give me way more of it they want me to lug it through the mud
And thus the reason with happy people Im disgusted
Im talking about those thangs that make you do bad thangs
Living the evil up in the fast lane
Making me wanna have a wicked persona
Beating the hell up out of people making me mad mane
Gave me the gun when I ran up in dealings in the ninth grade with a slight rage
I was Ice Age another reason Tecca N9na wont have any light days
Voted me the King of Darkness voted me to be really heartless
All up in my spirit they march they making me start sparking other targets
Woke up today I was steaming cause when I found out I was not dreaming
Because the host that influenced me the most was a goddamn demon
When I was one anda two anda three anda four
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plumb rotten to the core
It was nothing but an ittybitty demon
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no 
Can I kill it Hell no Can I kill it Hell no 
Theres a demon inside of me can I kill it Hell no 
Can I kill it Hell no Can I kill it Hell no

5890,"Yeah I say bitch bad
Woman good lady better
Hey hey hey hey
Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
Now I aint trying to make it too complex
But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along and this what she says
Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch
Somethin thats far above average
And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage
And baby carriage and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin here
First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama comma
And because shes relatin to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Im killin these bitches 
Uh tell em bitch bad
Woman good lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood
Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12
On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches
Now lets say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
Reality check Im not trippin
They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Im killin these bitches 
I say I say I say I say I say I say
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Im killin these bitches 
Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using bitch as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
Sho enough in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house hot mess like that
Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
But bad mean bad to him bitch dont play a part
But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch what a double entendre
Tell em bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
I say I say I say I say I say I say
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
They misunderstood
Bitch bad woman good
Lady better they misunderstood
Youre misunderstood
Im killin these bitches

3010,"Goodbye rap
This song is about everybody involved in hiphop
People that just came into this business so late
All the DJs that dont know what they are doing that dont know real records
And everybody that think they can rap wasting time
This song is called Goodbye Rap
This song is the last song
I quit rap couldnt find competition
I threw hiphop in the garbage
The rap hall of fame had to pay homage
While everyone was fat cookin sausage
I was wearin ostrich
Rap aint been the same since I had it hostage
The last song I guess was written wrong
First class flight Im leavin MCs to fight over whos the best Im gone
To a secret shelter in space
An astronaut ready to take off
Go home to the Bat Cave and take my cape off
A rock star still I will shock tomorrow
Rap went out the door all MCs cry with tears
Miss my metaphor
Inspiration gone now they gotta see artificial tissue on tour
From the Bronx true story
Ask Bambaataa and Kool Herc
I dont rap no more I dont rap no more
Thats it
And the downloaders you get no credit
You destroyed your own thing all over
Remember that You aint really fly
The ciphers WHACK
Everybody samplin old man records WHACK
Everybody tryin to collect records WHACK
Everybody trying to get up on open mics WHACK
All the DJs playing trendy music WHACK
Commercial artists trying to collaborate with pop artists WHACK
Everybody trying to think they can grow dreads to become hiphop WHACK
Finalists and panelists talking on TV shows trying to judge rap WHACK
People that just got into rap yesterday WHACK

Three major playas gettin papers by the layers

Fakers get used as shootin targets soon as the dark hits

Aint nothin but a party everybody come along
Keep your body movin while Im groovin with the song
I got funky rhythms funky rhythms with a beat
Funkfunkfunkfunky rhythms for the street
Keep clappin while Im rappin while Im rappin clap your hands
Listen to the listen to the listen to the man
Turn the party out without a doubt Im in the house
Kick it to the beat is what its really all about
Party party people if youre ready listen up
Cause I can get the lyrics Easy Lee can get the cut
An automatic systematic rhythmatic sound
If you aint with the program you gotta get it down
Breakin competition competitions ripped apart
Find another brother cause LL aint got the heart
I can take a rhythm make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
To the beat yall
To the beat yall
To the to the
To the beat yall 
If Im mentally conditioned then Im physically prepared
To cold rock a party with the microphone I bear
Im ready for action satisfaction guaranteed
Give the people what they want and what they want is what they need
Desperately to hear a brother kick a rhyme like this
Dont settle for another cause you know what time it is
Time to pick your feet up put your body in the mode
And listen to a real rap veteran explode
Other sucker brothers always comin incomplete
Forget about the lyrics cause they only want the beat
And other punk brothers put a curse in every verse
Frontin cause nobody taught em how to rhyme first
Frontin like youre hard but its only a facade
And now youre goin out like a sucker like Todd
But I can take a rhythm make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat you can forget Da Break Of Dawn

Excercisin patterns sowin up the rappin scene
Rockin for the people like a funky rap machine
Synchronize a party cause the party people watch
Only dancin when I tell em cause I rock round the clock
Masters of the ceremonys one and only one
Can rock it like a rocket phoney homies better run
Cause Im doin the damage and the damage will be done
Lyrics are the bullets so I never need a gun
Just a microphone speakers tables and a plug
Sit back and watch the people cut themselves and slice a rug
And Ima rock a party till its time to bring it home
And when they pull a plug then Ima pack a microphone
Put it in my holster like a gun and then Im gone
Strapped ready to rap and on and on and on
I can take a rhythm make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat you can forget Da Break Of Dawn

If you analyze me what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious hypnotic it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot Id be that potent product
Now get a load of me flashy far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle 
Nigga you get in my way while Im trying to get mine
And Ill buck you Buck you 
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you Fuck you 
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle 
Its the Hustlers Ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin
The drama means nothing its part of the game
Catch me in the coup switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win Im full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up but Im back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender make a protein shake
Im like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefnerll tell you he aint got shit on me
The feds watch me icey they cant stop me
Racist pointing at me Look at Niggaraci hello
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle 
Nigga you get in my way while Im trying to get mine
And Ill buck you Buck you 
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you Fuck you 
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle Hustle

4388,"I keep dwellin on the past babe
Know what I need yeah
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
Its better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldnt be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies
Some on the fence some befriended me
But when we see each other its gon be some weird energy
Im sorry that we couldnt make it work
Believe in your heart I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking bout thats supposed to be you girl
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But whats a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without em
Need solutions less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain feel the pain inside em
Kinda lost need someone to guide em
Its nothin worse than feelin alone
But Ill admit to feelin better when Im hearing this song it goes
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me
So I dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat baby
Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when Im blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need
I need some real good lovin
Cause Im troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin
Cause aint nobody been around here lovin on me

Cole time to get paid blow up like the World Trade
Sometimes I brag like Hov sometimes Im real like Pac
Sometimes I focus on the flow to show the skills I got
Sometimes I focus on the dough look at these bills I got
This is a message for some rappers tryna steal my spot
You niggas famous on the internet Im real life hot homie
Get your weight up fake niggas get sprayed up
My verbal AK slay faggots
And I dont mean no disrespect whenever I say faggot okay faggot
Uh dont be so sensitive
If you want to get fucked in the ass thats between you and whoever elses dick it is
Pause maybe that line was too far
Just a little joke to show how homophobic you are
And who can blame ya Boy Meets World Im tryna find a new Topanga
And bang her out no hanging out
My pops was club hopping back when Rick James was out
And all I get is Trinidad James wait a minute thats strange
Sip a bit of champagne say fuck it
If the hoes like it I love it nigga nigga nigga
Used to watch Rap City Big Tigga Tigga
Rap nerd even copped Rah Diggah Diggah
Pac had a nigga saying fuck Jigga fuck Biggie
I was only like 11 so forgive me
A decade later Id be all up in the city
Tryna get Hov to fuck with me
With a burned CD full of jams that was up in my hand
When he said he didnt want it it was fuck him again
One day he gon regret playing me
Little did I know in a year hed be fucking paying me what could you say to me I
Beat the odds like Vegas I used to rap about haters
Before niggas was hating me now they hate to see

I snuck up out the parts where niggas be living heartless
And cannot tell the difference between Iraqi Israeli
And so Im wondering really what could you actually tell me
Im tryna keep my homie from throwing crack in the skully
So back with this pen to give back for my sins
Took a black president to tell the Japanese sorry
But who the fuck gon tell my niggas sorry
Never seen his pops cause hes sorry
Fucked up education would ask for reparations
But Im probably just gon go and buy Ferraris vroom
Please forgive him
According to the preacher man he needs Jesus in him
But the Devil run the TV so the demons in em
Im in trouble
Did a deal with the Devil now Im pleading with him
Like give me my soul
My nigga I aint ever letting you go again
I aint ever letting go
I aint ever letting you go again
Please give me my soul

Old white billionaires Im sure that they can do without me
And I aint really into sacrificing human bodies
Couple more As I wouldve been a summa cuma laude
Beyonc told me that she want to cop the blue Bugatti
That shit is more than what Im worth I think she knew it probably
Well this is awkward awkward
Want to know what else is really awkward awkward
When niggas buy rings for bitches I had flings with
Im praying I dont see em at the Oscars Oscars

4630,"Enter the dragon as I start to braggin and taggin
And sayin Im baggin all rappers on the bandwagon
Feel the fury of a renegade well men I slayed
So send the aid cause I penetrate
Bein the best up with lyrics I dress up so dont even mess up
Or try to press up its better to fess up
Cause if a rapper ever goes too far man
I start to screamin on MCs like Tarzan
So witness the glare when I appear
Nonell compare so take a seat in the rear
Child you gotta understand you just the man
Sittin next to the man sittin next to the man sittin next to the man
And no one friar comes higher than the messiah
Sparkin the mic like a live wire til I retire
Whatever the comp is I burn em like fire
With all the blow I hit em hard like PIYAH
So take your hand and fold cause this is total control
And no one grabs a hold huh
You got somethin to say before its told
If you speakin on me you better hablo espaol
Cause I aint tryin to have none of the pentyante
Mumble jumble kick yak you better get back
Clear the way when you see me comin through
Back up and bow nuff respect due
Nuff respect due
Uhh I come down and put my weight on it
Drop somethin straight on it and sound great on it
Parties erupt and stages corrupt
I pour like a quart in a cup word up
I GET the JOB done
Makin the young boys say Daddy I dont want none
You puttin the man to a boy before I can even destroy
I played him like a toy Heavens to Merkatroid
Check my Modus Operandi
Those who know my name know I aint about games
I go beyond knockin em out the box
You want to be a comedian Aight wheres Redd Foxx
So if I want you believe Im gonna get you
I wouldnt give a damn if Tony Terry was witchu

Til the darkness is gone love remains strong

Passionate interludes is such
When your gone your bodys what I yearn to clutch
Just imagine ecstasy floatin in a cloud
Animal attraction burnin through the crowd

Smooth little girls fall in love with rough guys
But you can chop a big heart down to pint size
I guess thats what it sounds like when the dove cries
Uh the whole world is trapped up in a maze
But you save this real good lovin for rainy days
Uh the lord works in mysterious ways

King fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side
Forever infinite time we intertwine

The road less travelled is ours to explore

7438,"Immortal Technique
Revolutionary Vol 2 yeah
Broadcasting live from Harlem New York Yeah 
Let the truth be known
You better watch what the fuck flies out of your mouth
Or Ima hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC
Cause AIDSinfested child molesters arent sicker than me
I see the world for what it is beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My wordsll expose George Bush and bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same sevenheaded dragon
And you cant fathom the truth so you dont hear me
You think Illuminatis just a fuckin conspiracy theory
Thats why conservative racists are all runnin shit
And your phone is tapped by the federal government
So Im jammin frequencies in your brain when you speak to me
Techniquell rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally cause Im never hesitant
Sniperscopin a commission controllin the president
Father forgive them for they dont know right from wrong
The truthll set you free written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life thatll save your soul
Save your soul motherfucker save your soul
Yeah yeah yeah
I hacked the Pentagon for selfincriminating evidence
Of Republicanmanufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps flak vest with the guns and ammo
Spittin bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line
So heres the truth about the system thatll fuck up your mind
They gave alQaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldnt destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watchin the towers and though I wasnt the closest
I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge
Four nonArabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama and they said it was proof
Jealous of our freedom I cant believe you bought that excuse
Rockin a motherfuckin flag dont make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven God overslept on the seventh
The New World Order was born on September 11th
Father forgive them for they dont know right from wrong
The truthll set you free written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life thatll save your soul
Save your soul motherfucker save your soul
And just so conservatives dont take it to heart
I dont think Bush did it cause he isnt that smart
Hes just a stupid puppet takin orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin and lockin
Lookin for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact Rumsfeld now that I think back
Without 911 you couldnt have a war in Iraq
Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion
Tax cut extortion a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney you fuckin leech tell em your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggas fooled but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
Thats why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth I dont scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis
In 98 when he was top ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the government lies
Read it yourself instead of askin the government why
Cause then the cause of deathll cause the propaganda to die
Father
Forgive them
He is scheduled for 60 Minutes next Hes going on French British Italian Japanese television People everywhere are starting to listen to him Its embarrassing

On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist fuck you bitch
I dont really wanna have to bust you bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they cant touch that shit
I dont trip niggas pull up
I be lookin proud when I bust that dutch
Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the Hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Never try to jack you gon lose cause like Cube Ima kill at will
And motherfuckers wanna take my style
Cause niggas out here know Im only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let yall niggas play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin 8 Ball MJG
Twista bitch and I from the Chi
With my Memphis connect and I aint gon lie
We be specializing in only coming up with dope shit
And pulling up with cold wheels thats fly
Still drink still blow then I creep through the hood real slow
Ride when I bump Kamikaze shit while I scream look at my grill ho

The club close at 5 oclock we pulling up around three
Woodgrain wheel gripping Cinderella sipping
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken
Money players keep me gleamin like Im Willie Beamen
Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She scheming dreaming wishing she can be my number one
Forever young mama I just wanna have some fun
Dont try to ever take my cash from me
You might as well jump off a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like thats my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin back at perpetrators
We dont discriminate well hurt now and hurt you later
But I aint worried Ill smoke one of you fucking haters
And now Im higher than gators on the refrigerator
Down south Memphis Tenn pimpin gotta rep it

Youre so much older and wiser too
Would you help me mr wiseman

You got stacks of money to the sky up above
Now all you need is to find you a love

He sent me searching to the Lord up above
He sent me searching just to find the morning dove
And shell tell you where to find your love

7607,"Living in some times thats the craziest
They say these legislators are the laziest
Dedicated religious figures have gone atheist
Each and everything must change theres no escaping this
Im on the block post apocalyptic smoke covers
Coincidentally presented by the Koch brothers
The magnitude of this is bigger than the both of us
The attitude is trying to manage not to choke from it
Go and get the bolt cutters Open the flood gate
Any relationship Ive ever been in was lovehate
The city I was living in really never was safe
For some a temporary resolution was duct tape
Now Imma probably be on the black list
But I dont give a fuck so Imma shrug like Atlas
And if my skepticism was a brand new practice
Would yall be disappointed like you just got catfished
Its coldblooded Im wholeheartedly coldhearted and swole from it
The same unseen hands still in control of it
I should be minding own like its a gold nugget
But Im on that same bullshit just on a lower budget
Waiting on chains that bend low
To let day after tomorrow I sit by the window
And the police state like your man Michael Winslow
My kinfolk told me theres a brand new Jim Crow
Ive been going to bed at ten up at five
Hustle to the bus and ride
To the job
Its feeling hot as the Fourth of July
My lady just getting home We living separate lives
She couldnt be one of those Stepford wives if she tried
They shot my cousin He died It wasnt justified
I guess I see him if I make it to the other side
The corner deli owner tell me hurry up and buy
If everybody is somebody tell me who am I
The same figure who came from Anguilla
Aint nothing different
I think Im addicted to pain killers
Im unpermitted to enter the village
Of Shangri La
Im depicted as being the killa this dangerous huh
Half dozen in one hand Six in the other
Yo this is more than a suntan
its living color
Black as oblivion
Black as obsidian
Black as the sky at midnight altomeridian
I am black as the porch who
With Diddy 2Pac and Biggie in
Black as the influence on the culture were living in
I survived the childless circuit
Vaudevillian in
Managed inspire the Beatles and Bob Dylan and them
But did I miss the mark because Im just as dark
As John Hendrick Clarks inner thoughts
At the time of the Harlem Renaissance
After which
Rights activists
Deviated the flight path
The black ratchedness
Putting us back smack dab
Where night catches us
We just go along for the ride
Passengers
Gluttons for punishment Masochists
Still doing whatever master asks of us
Will this generation go down as the last of us
Will being young men while black was hazardous
Into the proverbial masked avenger all these pretenders
Suffer from symptoms of affluenza
Im just thinking out loud about
Extinction and genders and plans
My grandmother definitely remembers
Listen her suits were tailor made
Sundays Mahila played
Simple familiar ways like the way she
Knelt and prayed
Well and Lord and master forgive us our trust
Pastors had us well afraid
I never listened But I still obeyed
I got to see how the gangsters played at such an early age
When my father was there to set them to us early grave
Their mom started chasing that base like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain
Shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings black daughters what that all became
My journey from a dirty hallway to the hall of fame
Music my therapeutic way to deal with all this pain
I was headed for the drain
Soaking before the rain water came
And chaos thats when the order came
I started what Im supposed to in life
Trying to move out of the dark and closer to the light
They say when you get a chance to do it over
Do it right
Because tomorrow was a promise every time we say Good night
Listen
Dope Shot
Mug Shot
Gun Shot
Jump Shot
Take your pick But you only got only one shot
Advice from a school teacher to a young tot
Applying a sticker to a Spiderman lunch box
When even role models tell us were born to be felons
And we aint getting into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And of these other peoples blessings weve grown to be jealous
Its not fair thats all they can tell us
Thats why I hustle hella hard
I dont celebrate a holiday
That could be the day a brother could have struck the lottery
I refuse to ever to lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up to just another one that got away
So Im unapologetic
Im on my calisthenics
If I had giving it all I got I can not regret it
My final destinations different from where I was headed
Because Im going to shoot for the stars to get it
One shot

And no doubt we rubbed you wrong and rubbin you out
To try to tackle such a problem is a foolish goal

Geographically earthed in a place called Queens
I was formed with my principles way I displayed
How I used to MC where all the other kids played
Cause I was way too ill so I would hone my skill
And go out in the park and let my chemicals spill
Right there on Farmers Boulevard I made my mark
Two dudes niggas would dip from us me and NARCS
And then my legend would grow on the Atrain line
Where brothers would gather to see me blowin nicks and dimes
It was me Big Pete Tanya and Sir Ibu
And the heat of the cipher I was not libel
From all the casualties of the dutty MCs
I split the train car like Moses did the Red Sea
So get it in ya head we gon rock the dead
Night of the living MCs the weak ones fled
And the stage is the pulpit Renaissance wont quit
We gon baptize yall for your benefit
We been aligned and assigned to change
Rearrange all your molecules like Dr Strange
Making cultures move if you disapprove
You can keep loudmouthin aint gon bust a groove
You see the object of the game is we dont see it as one
We dont quit bullshit and we never lost son
Deeper than the oceans and expand like air
We be vast indeed and if your hearings impaired
We got the perfect remedy for you tonight
Just put your ear to it its like dynamite
And its the Renaissance Rap
Uh uh its the Renaissance
It is the Renaissance
Uhcause its the Renaissance

Now lookin at ya clock you know that its time
To hear real ill beats combinated with rhymes
Brought to you by the person at the TOP
That be GOD and I be TIP
The promoter of the flyness witness wit iris
Of this lame and he came but Im the royal highness

You better off joinin the force because we cant be done

Heres the deal we shatter his grill and drill fuck him
Oral torture no doubt the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops hes guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels
Its settled better put on your metal foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto a rebel of chance the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash level advance
Takin a chance Ive only got one my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge jury and Johnny Cochran
Movin on the stash first we get the cash
For the fast money I smash the niggas shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe anybody move gettin laced
Look at my face and Ima shoot the place
Ayo the plot thickens Im pickin the locks in the back entrance
Payin attention not tryin to get knocked and catch a fat sentence
Not to mention these kids is mafioso with lots of dough so
They got the popo locked with a Don The Rock Muraco chokehold oh oh 
Their security systems linear laser protection
No sweat I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin
Inspectin the vault for weapons assault second of course
Its poison it sprays boiled and baked in Epsom salt
Reppin New York is the cat burglar the fat murderer
Slippin the clip in the MAC inserterer
Hurtin your pockets droppin your stock to zero profit
Holdin heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like De Niro mob flicks
Back to the topic at hand the grand prize
The safe flies open the shine almost blinded my eyes
I cracked the code enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban started movin for the back lets go
Thats when I heard the sirens hopin that my ears was lyin
Knew we was dyin when I saw the guard we tortured cryin
Pointin at the building screamin I can see them kill em
Snipers was willing but couldnt theres too many civilians
Still inside nowhere to hide nowhere to run
Cuban said Fuck it we die we die busting our guns
Oye castigador saca el fucking caon
Vamos pa la guerra vamos searlo
A castigarlos

I cock the Eagle Cuban drew the Glock it was diesel
Said See you in Hell coppers and started poppin like it was legal
We need a plan if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin out of ammo I got about a handful of Black Rhinos and two Rambos strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said Move your fat ass faster motherfucker they gaining
I gave him the case told him Go head save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory tell the family I gave em Hell
For real thats when I heard the tires screechin
Peeped and it was Joe the God with twenty Terror Squad niggas reachin
conversation and gunfight to fade

A nigga gettin to some money and his bitch bad
Jumpin out the Rolls truck with the temp tag

Ask a nigga in my hood he gon say that Im stamped
And when them situations came I came out like a champ
When it was pourin down rain and I came out of it damp
But now its champagne showers when we poppin the champ ugh
We dodged all the Feds and they traps
Niggas cant be us cause they rats
Stand tall point a finger never that
I knew a nigga had it all went to the bing aint get it back
Thats why Im humble as ever and I rumble whatever
Dont chase hoes cause they come with this cheddar
I seen my man girl start actin bougie when he fuck up his cheddar
Before you knew it niggas was fuckin her better
I knew about it and I
Wanted to tell him I felt funny as ever
But when I told him he went runnin to tell her damn
Remember I was down bad Im talkin under the cellar
Now the Rolls Royces come with umbrellas
For the rain and all the pain that we been through
If you dont feed your wolves they gon put you on the menu

Just hold your composure I seen this shit happen over and over
That couple hundred thousand holdin you over
That aint real money
Thats bill money buy a Rollie get a wheel money
Catch a case pay a lawyer take a deal money
Now you tapped out and got no appeal money
Callin home like niggas done did you wrong
But when you had that money you couldve put niggas on
And the moment they put cuffs on you your bitch was gone
Student of the game Im just ahead of my class

My name is Common No ID
Ferrari Testas Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga Ye Im about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like Im Kobe now
We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
Its the pop life a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lye than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John Lennon Im a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero Ill drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina
Im a dreamer
Its for the world world world world world
Dream on
We take uh we make uh paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water building my faith up
Niggas with no heart Im the pacemaker
Get the beat from No I feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high so I gotta land them
Career aint random make anthems streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
Its Common Im high above standard
Fly nigga keep my feet planted
To rock the planet I dont stop for panic
Maybe Im a hopeless HipHop romantic
Im a dreamer
Its for the world world world world world
Dream on
He introduced me I stepped to the podium
Said peace gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up thought about my daughter for a second
The youth the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world the world is at my fingers
Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now its gold records and Im on silver screens
At the mountaintop you still gotta dream
To the dreamers
If I dream youre here
And you dream Im there
Well be nowhere near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it
Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From easternEurope they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were misnamed on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico from Asia they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world they came to America
Many shivering in rags and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
Let us dare to dream

5984,"Fifteen years old thought I was in love
I was never told sex is like drugs
Too muchll drive you crazy in fact
The brother was so good had me comin back
Took my virginity like he took my heart
I had to find the Lyte he left me in the dark
All alone no one to be with
And the brothers they ask me why I riff
I got hard grew a shell upon my back
I had to get a grip to keep my life intact
I had to let em know Lyte is not fragile
Cause if they think this brothers can get foul
Theyll use bruise and abuse
Dump your ass and be sure to choose
The next fresh fish that steps into the place
If they desire they forgot your face
Lovin them and leavin them that was their reasonin
Thinkin he was pleasin you when he was just TEASIN you
Summer was over back in school
He said come over that would be cool
I said OK its been a year now
Some even asked why some even asked how
Could you wait that long for me to be with it
Some said yo Hobbes youre never gonna get it
But then the time came you and I both came
Things would soon change never would they be the same
Before this afternoon took place
I was in love I walked around in space
Id rush home from school just to speak to you
Talk for an hour maybe even two
Wed just laugh though nothing serious
I guess back then you were just curious
To see what I was like just to touch my flesh
I could be wrong though thats my first guess
You was in your house I was in mine
As long as we were chattin on the line it was fine
All alone yet talkin on the phone
If you got bored you felt your bone
And as bad as I am I talked you through every stroke 
Lyte aint no joke
Youve been beggin for some time for me to come visit
You never got mad though if I wasnt widdit
But this day was different I was feelin in the mood
For some slow type of groove or some soul food
In other words sex yeah thats better
I threw on the Jordache the Izog sweater
That was in style then come on dont laugh
Sergios Lees you wore those in the past
Anyway I arrived twenty past five
Hed been hypin himself sayin he was quite live
I said heres your chance show me some romance
We begin to slow dance off with his pants
BOOM it was over damn that was quick
Too bad little homey had a widdle widdle HORN
The only one Ive seen cause yo he was the first
But since Ive had others damn he was the worst
I was in love though that didnt matter
Nothin you could say could ever shatter
My world take it away just a young little girl
Oh well
He stepped jet family moved
Leavin me in the mood for some soul food
Damn I felt hurt just like a jerk
Would somebody PLEASE just mush my face in dirt
So I can hide from the whole fuckin world
WHAT THE FUCK IS LOVE such a naive girl
Suppose I got pregnant damn Id be lost
My mom woulda kicked me out to live with Jack Frost
I guess Im lucky though lonely for sure
Waitin for the fucker to come knockin at my door
I didnt hold my breath though I might be dead
Yo 45 next time Ill use my head

7064,"Look somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow silk sheets and a satin pillow
This California king loved you like a sack of indo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos
Master suite frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like a blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
Know wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just dont look down at your feet
Look
Told this world I was a star Im gon need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
We used to be respected now they laughin
Weve turned into possessions with no passion
How we go from the best to less than average
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
With no collective identity 
You You You You
Its every man for himself 
Me Me Me Me
We need a black mafia 
Us We We
Look 
Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit
I think too much TV is what ruins kids
When homosexual actors is their influences
We need community centers that teach the music biz
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit
Dont take no hand outs you build it its more lucrative
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit
You get abused long enough you start abusing shit
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way
He shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
No separation 
Who Who Who Who
You You You You
Divide and conquer 
Me Me Me Me
Its the Art of War 
Us We We
Who detached us
Look 
Death is the destination we all share No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Lifes change agent It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life
Dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking
Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition They somehow already know what you truly want to become Everything else is secondary
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
It was their farewell message as they signed off
And now I wish that for you
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish

6686,"Ah one two ah one two
Ah one two ah one two
Id like to introduce myself
My name is ah Biz Markie
Well Im the human orchestra called Biz Markie
Makin music orally is my specialty
When I go BOOM ah one two girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite em
I know yall in the mood just go with the flow
And I can play rappin records and all disco
Like Beat It Billie Jean by Michael Jackson
Or the Treacherous Three record they call Action
When you hear me do it you will be shocked and amazed
Its the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Well I dont just do the beatbox I rock on the mic
And all the rhymes that I say all the people like
I get the crowd jumpin get the girls hearts pumpin
All the party people say Isnt he somethin
Rock from New York City all the way down South
Sayin rhymes and makin music with my mouth
Imma tell you party people how I began
It started when Im livin in Long Island
Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Makin sounds with my mouth all sorts of beats
Grown people used to say WHAT
Grown people used to say WHATS
wrong with that kid makin that strange noise
It was like for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboys basement party
They thought it was a record they aint know it was me
When they came by the DJ and saw who it is
They said Make the music with your mouth Biz
song continues as just a beat for a while
It may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox
But its real difficult even knocked me out my socks
Its a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
I like doin it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
Its not all about spittin breathin hard and chewin
You need practice be ambitious in the schoolin
Let me tell you party people you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
Thats why I like doin sounds thats hard to achieve
Makin two or three sounds at one time you cant believe
When I walk down the street people crowd around me
And say HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time Biz Markie
I tell em it takes a lot of practice and lip control
Ive been doin it since fifteen years old
And everywhere I do it the people say Im good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
Im tellin you a fact its just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say Whattup Biz
Everywhere I go I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say Im the best
But Im guaranteed to pass any kind of test
I say def rhymes with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS
You heard the beginning now heres the sequel
All human beatboxes is not created equal
Thats why Im here to say today
That Im doin my beat in a special way
Makin musical tunes orally I have perfected
Im very well known and greatly respected
I like to thank people without no doubt
Peace hi party people its time to break ou
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music

2178,"Lady B Goode Lyrics
It was down in Louisiana right there in New Orleans
Back there in the 60s was a little teen queen
Fell then the lassie in love with a lad
Till it took him to vindicate take the feelings she had
She pleaded as she promised every prayer she could
Till everybody whispered to her Lady B Goode
She followed him around where he would play his guitar
Till he got so popular they made him a star
Then she could only see him on a TV screen
And hoped someday that hed come back to New Orleans
Everybody liked her and was knocking on wood
But soon there came a baby from the Lady B Goode
She wondered if hes ever coming back someday
The brighter lights and glory may just keep him away
But then he wrote and told her Do not be dismayed
The love you have for me will never be betrayed
They want me do a movie about my livelihood
And I want you to play the part of Lady B Goode
She went to see the movie when it hit the screen
Babysitting Johnnie Jr down in New Orleans
He saw his daddy sing the song he heard in school
The one his mother told him about the golden rule
Tears filled her eyes when they misunderstood
When everybody knew that she was Lady B Goode

Yet I never saw you before

5136,"Yeah it is what it is
Tell em aint no me
Feel me
Vinny Idol nigga
Streets know the aura Tommy guns fedoras
Watch for the creeps the peeps on the corner
Mommy read Genesis I cred the Torah
Supposed to be righteous but I love the horror
Was thrilled by crime
I cant believe I let a motherfuckin dollar bill kill my mind
Dull my senses steal my shine
It took a strong will from me to heal my mind
Still Im blind cause still I grind
This aint Astrology but feel my sign
Ghost walk his path align feel his rap align
Cause I kick shit that make the pastor cry
Weed pacify or pass the time
Got the soul of a slave with a mastermind
Get real ill make a statue cry
Cause gettin real deep thats a knack of mine
But fuck accolades blow a splif and get kicks off a page
Homie put the MAC away
You either live or you die slow
Might you burn Os and hide dough from 50
Im John Doe in the Tahoe
Glow in the dark how a sparkll leave your mind blown
My times up in your time zone still on the flow but my nigga Im a ride on

I be on my own shit all about that dough shit
Greedy mother fucker on that low shit
I be on my own shit all about that dough shit
Grease a eightyeight thats that blow shit
I be on my own shit
This is all from the school of hard knocks
From Wyo to Far Rock Im the nigga they play on the hard blocks
Whats the meaning of time when you lookin at God clock
Speakin on the patterns in the sky
Niggas make rules up and break em but Im adamant with mine
Catalyst for crime talk shit Im shatterin your spine
Cause I aint get a ladder for the climb
Nah no ropes no hikin shit
Had to play Valhalla on some vikin shit
But never snitch gone on the deal
Live niggas keep it real go out on they shield
No longer doin crime but I could pass a line
Take a couple points hit a joint that is by design
Tradition kept surprised a lotta niggas aint missin yet
Just cause they aint listen yet
I know they deaf but they aint get the vision yet
Who am I to judge
Only robe I wear is from the telly on the balcony
Blowin on the bud
And I aint got a ego I could show a nigga love
I got a Desert Eagle that could show a nigga mud
Dick in the dirt floor wet cause of the blood
To tell the truth nigga I rather give you a hug
And you just mad cause of the plug
I know what it is not what it was
I be on my own shit all about that dough shit
Greedy mother fucker on that low shit

The bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
And when dealin with Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin is not just the name of this jam
But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers thats known to break em off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent front and back glass got tint
Tryin to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools cant hold us
Every chance we get we hittin up the rollers
Comin up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin bean pies
Or the bootleg tshirt of the month
With U Cant Touch This on the front
Im out to get rich
Cause life aint nothin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didnt know Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
Im out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
Cause Im ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch cause Im steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Bustin caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause Im gettin major
Fuck PacTel move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Dont drink 8Ball cause St Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad tempers are flarin
Cause they got a few bitches starin
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss em
Out cause I just dont trust em
And if you tell on me Im bombin on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Since onetime so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
Cause Im rollin on rims
Eating soul food neckbones from MMs
Grubbin like a motherfucker
Greasyass lips now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin
When I hit a left on Ruthelen What up loc
Dont you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke Get in nigga
Ill take you to the pad soon
Went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bones house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob aint nothin but tramps
For hoes lickin nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I dont want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash
I said Yeah but I dont play sex
Without puttin on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night no longer steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life

Folk in your face youre a superstar
Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars make a million mo
First class broad treat you like a nigga po
You wanna say Wait but youre scared to ask
As your world starts spinning and its moving fast
Tryin to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds then you go on home
I must admit they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain from the host of cocaine
From them whores from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
Theyre from the Glock rounds and lockdowns and burials
The seeds that sow get devoured by the same locusts
Cause its a hard row to ho
If your ass dont move and the rain dont fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong so some survive
So youre surprised now Im bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride fool I dont wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted without infanticide
Its like that red sprite you cant imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid twofold on technicalities
Clickin your heels scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe though
I dont think we in Kansas no mo though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldnt be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel
Runnin with they pack tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin helpin the shacklin of your brethren happening
Just by rappin

I was out there Bloodin like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin rentals in front of Centennial
Remedial thoughts never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic fuck bitches ride around bouncin shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck to dishraggin bitches
That was hard to fuck I came up it was hardly luck
Just left Compton and I aint have to use my AK
What a day what a day
Back when my drivers license was babyfaced and triflin
I made my way through crisis I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens I made you hate the vibrant
You cant escape the tyrant you cant relate where Ive been
In 98 my problem actin too grown and shit
Cappin at bitches yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me thats on me
Raise up nigga you are not the homie
Bitch Im wellconnected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin with Tetris if your block neglectin your ki
Every day I wake up with my face up to my Father
Makin sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my green and stuff and double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality my dj vu done caught up
Bitch Im brought up with the homies thats on me
247 Kendrick reverend these cold streets
Dog we live by it die by it then reincarnate
And if Game told me Drive by it I raise AK
Aint no shame on it cry about it fuck that I play
Like no name on it blindsided aint no one safe

Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It aint no better one son it aint no tellin me nothin
Nigga thats Chuck Doc Dre and K the legacys done BLAOW
Oh man
You thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity its still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella
There I go give me a minute nigga
Bout to hit a home run K Dot grab the pennant nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton trap late night Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Aint no gimmicks round here this Compton me Doc and Kendrick
Chronic good kid my firstyeah three documentaries
Now Im blockin sentries 16 Impalas

Damage damage damage damage
They cock them hammers wave them llamas
But thats that in front of the camera drama
So when the cameras are attached to dollys I call them dali lamas
Mold me loathe hold me in the palm of your hand load me
You know exactly what I am murderer
When Im inserted on to the top of fifteen family members
Its the curse of the proverbial anarchy starter the martyr
This is what I have been converted to do what I do is insanity
Profofofanity when they manually hammer me annually
You dont figitty faze me yo
I wont tigitty tase you bro
Figgity fucking cut you in half like its nothing minus the laser scope
Then I will ring your bell like Avon
Before displaying some of my various tattoos Trayvon 
The Oscar award winning Aiyana Jones hey Sean 
Sworn to be cannon fodder for your father slaughter daughters
Armor piercing tumblers more deadlier than napalm
Fuck a stray bullet I take aim when the gun draws
For everlasting fame I will maim those who change the gun laws
Cause post traumatic stress disorder ask any vet Ive worked with
My purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus
Ooh listen to the way I slay your crew

Nigga I will twist your liver like Oliver TWIST 
Scratch your name off my calendar
See that was me thru a silencer
What you just heard was a 44 caliber
Now you can fill in the blanks
I will pillage your town
Killing them with Dillinger rounds
Nigga fill in the clip cause Im willing to flip
See Im sort of certified Im fortified live
You would be mortified if I would put on screen what Ive seen
Horrified holy Bibles rivals vital organs
Little bitty baby bodies bridal gowns coffins
Morphine gang bang gangrene slauson swap meet
Meet greet pop I dont sleep I dont stop
I love hate hate cops
Thats why I laugh when you pull it
Im motivated and crass
Im so elated when I see them on the news you fuckin pigs 
They flying the flag half mass
See theres no need for conversation
When were discussing the bullets point of view

Like bumping around the town like when youre driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles Isaac Newton a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite gettin ova with the key
Now rock shocker the mike of the many times times the times tables
Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new knowledge
An emcee to a degree that you cant get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
Ive got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium the radium EMD squared
Kicked out of the Palladium dja think that I cared
Its the sounds of science the sounds of science
Science
RopeaDope
The newest in new Right up to your face and diss you
Waxin and milkin
All of yall square heads
Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reelin and rockin and rollin Bsized Dcup
Order the Quarter Deluxe why dontcha wake up
My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector
Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked and exploded
She woke up in the morning and her face was coated
Buddy you study the man on the mic
D do whatcha like Huh 
Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well I figured out who makes the crack its
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Professor of science cuz I keep droppin it
I smell weak cuz yall keep poppin it
People always ask me whats the phenomenon
Yo whats up Yo whats goin on
No one really knows what Im talkin about
And yeah thats right my names Yauch
Ponce De Leon constantly on
The fountain of youth not Robotron
Peace is a word Ive heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor
Cuz Im gonna die gonna die one day
Cuz Im goin and goin and goin this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
Im goin out first class aint goin out coach
Rock my Adidas never rock Filas
I do not sniff the coke I only smoke the sinsemilla
Well with my nose I knows and with my scope I scopes
What I live I write and thats strictly rope
I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equations
Well Cheech Wizard in a snow blizzard

The real pack cause them bustas try to hold you back

Pussy suckain disguise undercover
Fake brothastryin to come between another

Its 8Bizzal
Do you recall
Mr Big Mr Big
In your trunk splittin wigs
Mane thats the same time I could recollect
Young trick in my face asking me if I claim sets
And heres this other fool with dreads growin from his head
He tryin to tell me bout some shit Farrakhan said
I try to listen cause 8ball aint the one to knock it
But I cant hear over the echo from my empty pocket
Instead of sweating me fool sweat Chuck D
Cause I been true to playa shit since 83
Southern funkadelic preacher Im here to reach ya
Dont be so prejudiced and let my holy words teach ya
I never rap about sets cause I aint been through that
Even though a nigga did dirt and packed straps
I dont do what you do and you dont see what I see
Therefore we could not be the same do you feel me
I come from Tennessee and love drinkin Hennessy
Peace to KRS but heres my philosophy
I got the remedy four seconds after now
Yo my nig tell em who you is

Hell you gon do yo thang Im gon do mine

You might find some other way to pass your time
It aint bout where you from its bout what you do
And doin wrong gon make clues so trouble gon stick to you
True blue pimp shit is hard to break
But playa hatin bustas put the icin on the cake
Hate to see they own homies with a few ends
And still wonder why they cant get no dividends
A man aint who he say he is
If he gotta give false information bout what he had and how he live
And dont shit but the truth set you free
So trick stop all that lyin get those shackles way from me
He who tells the first lie gets the first smack
A chain react on the mack flossin fake facts
A freaky naked hoe makes no record deal
Perpetrators get for real
When hard times seem to find you yeah thats for real 
When all your good days behind you yeah thats for real

And you just constantly have to pay a due yeah thats for real

Eybody gonna say you done changed
And ery motherfucka think ery other motherfucka tryin to find a new hold in the game
See in my past I thought it was all in my mind
But in time I came to find people are blind
To the fact I dont give a fuck about your thoughts
Motherfuck the radio and fuck the magazine talk
Walk with the playa down the highway of what I say
Hear what I say is just another way to make me paid
Instead of gettin sprayed or runnin from police
I am in the studio smoked out bustin rhymes
And jealous hoes male and female
Been givin a nigga hell now that I am 
Jealous of the fact that my mack is not an act
Instead of packin gats Im strapped with my DATs
And all my homies slang dope for a livin
Or livin in a prison cause they couldnt fade the system
I miss them but still I gots to get up on my 
Im on a mission so the future wont see me in prison

A frank inside of a supermarket raw dog
Im the untouchable never to be took out
A Sexy Mother ooh child Prince look out
Im keepin girls of all shades on my trail
From a Sister Act down to a Single White Female
Cause when I hit the skins they all say Damn Kane 
You knock out the Bush like a presidential campaign
But if you think that lickin toes makes me weak
You better treat me like Freddy Krueger dont sleep
I write raps ready to rip and rock real rough rhymes
Run in rugged and raw rapidly ruinin roaches
Point blank I spell murder to a bum
All you backwards rappers REDRUM REDRUM
Cause I do em somethin awful break em down to a morsel
Makin sure that youre no longer adorable
Rappers get so quiet when Im comin that if they
Shitted a dictionary you couldnt get a word from em
Its sort of a tradition in BedStuy to do or die
So steppin to me is suicide
I couldnt think of a rapper takin mines
I feel like Ali Im the greatest of all times
Floatin like a butterfly stingin like a bee
Yeah I know this aint boxing but thats still my pedigree
But as for you you have no appeal
How you get a record deal
Like shelltoe Adidas aint a damn thing changed
The way I shoot off lyrics like a firing range
Breakin out in a cold sweat the death threat
Gettin more props than a movie set
The smooth microphone assassin rhymes keep blastin
Uh I keep the body count massive
But if you say you increased the Body Count troop
You must admit that you joined IceTs group
Cause you aint hurtin niggedy nuthin so why you bluffin
Tryin to be the new Big Daddy Something
But theres only before me no one is richer huh
You couldnt come Pryor if your name was Richard
Cause Im the Alpha and Omega
ArmLeguhLeguhArmHead stayin raw til Im dead
And to battle me you shouldnt even try
Cause with wings on your tongue you still couldnt say nothin fly
And I dont care if you bring a crew
And I dont even care if someone else writes for you
Man you could even be someone the crowd may just like but shoot
You couldnt see me with a bifocal mic
Check my resume Rapmasters Word Up
Yo MTV BET The Box and all that good stuff
And Billboard for my five year duration
And see that I got more spots than a dalmatian
Lets get down to finish this large
You could bring on your whole squad none of you chumps are hard
All that garbage you mumble aint real and seriously seriously
How you get a record deal
A lot of rappers today wonder
Should I ask Kane to write rhymes for me to say
Well youre goddamn right you should
Cause my rhymes are like spandex they make any ass seem good
So act like you know Baby Pop
When I riggedy rock the higgedy hiphop nonstop as I
Freak the funk and flip the flavor to flow with the flyest
A fury full force in the flames of the fire now
May these MCs rest in peace
Because when I come to town the population decrease
I leave em finished dead and thats that huh
Not even Pet Sematary could bring em back
I slay my prey they decay I tell em like Jennifer Holiday
No no no no no noooooooooooo way

On a tour of one night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one man band

Home where my thoughts escaping
Home where my musics playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Everydays an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines Mmm

And every strangers face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

In shades of mediocrity

I need someone to comfort me

Do a nigga four favors when you cant do the fifth
How soon they forget
Run up on you at your granny house give you nine like Fif
How are niggas sposed to love you niggas
Heart beatin fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas

If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didnt go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
Im in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get

Kid who pulled out bust a shot up in the Beacon
Catch me in the corner not speaking
Crushed out heavenly UG rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and broccoli Wallys look stink
He with his man straight from Raleigh Durham
He recognized Kojak I slapped him 5 Masta Killa cracked his Heine for him
Everybody break bread huddle around
Guzzle that Im about to throw hair on your back
Since the face been revealed game got real
Radio been gassing niggas my imposters scream theyre ill
Im the inventor 86 rhyming at the center
Debut 93 LP told you to Enter
Punk faggot niggas stealing my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma beneath the LaZBoy where you hid your knife
Ghost is back stretch Cadillacs fruit cocktails
Hit the shelves at Pauls Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Dorothy try to judge these
Plus Degrees sessical Rasta fiends
Getting waxed all through the drivethru
Take the stand throw my hand all on the Bible and tell lies too
Im the ultimate splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring
Dolomite student enroll holding it

Crush at high speeds strawberry kiwi

These Staten Island ferryboats cash bail bail 
Fresh cellies 50 deep up in the city
We banned for life Apollo Kids live to spit the real
A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks snatch em up son 20 off no tax
Dream merchant tucked in the cloud stay splurging
Rock a eagle head 6inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas vs Jets dudes slid in with one hand
Two Culture Ciphers one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up wasnt looking splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughing first thought was beat the bitch up
Moseyed off gracefully New Yorks most wanted cheeba hawk
Seen the yellow brick road I stole the pastries
Same Ghostface holy in the mind
Last seen Manhattan Chase withdrew the 68 digit in the briefcase
Rawness title is Hell bound
Quick to reload around faces surround look astound
We split a fair one Poconos money gin rummy with glare
Spot the lame bit his ear
Yo and taste a teaspoon 300 goons stash balloons
Locked in lab rooms hit with the Glock spazzed in Grants Tomb
Clocked him like a patient his stocks fall hustle invasion
Knowing now we copped the block off
The chain tricolor freezing in velour icicle galore
Gas station light gleaming on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams James Bond vans
Niggas flipped Timbs rock boats under water watch clams
Pose for the standoff mad timid
Hoping that the gun fall guessing like lottery balls yo

6955,"Gangsta Gangsta Clean Lyrics
Pull over to the side right now
Yo Dre gimme a funkyssa bassline
Heres a little somethin bout a brotha like me
Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That Im a crazy motha from around the way
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now Im the type of punk that you read about
Doin a crime or two thats what the hell I do
You dont like how Im livin well kcuf uoy
This is a crew and Im in it
My man Drell knock you out in a minute
With a right left rightleft youre toothless
And then you say Damn they ruthless
Well make you say it again Damn 
NWAs messing up the program
And then you realize we dont care
We dont just say no were too busy sayin Yeah
About drinking straight out the eight bottle
Tell the truth do I look like a role model
To a kid looking up to me
Life aint nothin but girls and money
Cause Im the type of brotha thats built to last
We had some in the present some in the past
But I dont give a damn cause I keep bailing
Yo tell em what they yelling
Gangsta gangsta thats what they yelling
Its not about a salary its all about reality
Gangsta gangsta
Hell tell you exactly how he feel and dont want a thing back
Homies all standing around just hangin
Some dopedealin some gangbangin
We decide to roll and we deep
See a sucka on Daytons and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my AK pointed in the window
Check it in punk or I might blast
He got scared and hit the gas
We tried to catch him but you all know
You cant catch a 50 so
We headed right back to the fort
Sweatin all the girls in the biker shorts
We didnt get no play from the ladies
With six thugs in a car are you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
We all said Kcuf uoy hctib and kept going
To the hood and we was fittin to
Look for somethin else to get into
Like a new female or in fact
A bum rush but we call it rat pack
On a sucka for nothin at all
Ice Cubell go stupid when Im full of eight ball
I might stumble but still wont lose
Now Im dressed in the county blues
Cause Im the type of brotha thats built to last
We had some in the present some in the past
But I dont give a damn cause I keep bailin
Yo tell em what they yellin
Wait a minute wait a minute cut this
Man what you gon do now
What we gonna do right here is go way back
How far you goin back Way back
As we go a little somethin like this hit it
Heres a little gangsta short in size
A tshirt and Levis is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and EazyE cold rockin it
Well Im EazyE the one they talkin about
Sucka tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll so its time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the 64
With the diamond in the back sunroof top
Diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
Cause Im the E I dont slang or bang
I just knock suckas out like it aint no thang
And all the ladies you know Im talkin to you
We love you Eazy Yeah I love you too
Because you see you know I gotta be legit
So let me tell you stupid suckas who youre messing with
Cause Im the type of brotha thats built to last
We had some in the present some in the past
But I dont really care cause I keep bailin
Yo tell em what they yellin
Gangsta gangsta thats what they yelling
Its not about a salary its all about reality
Gangsta gangsta
Hell up you and yours and anything that gets in his way

Yo Chubb you start it off we gonna freak it
Cmon
Verse One Chubb Rock
Here we go
To the consumer and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I come backwards on stuff you dont deny
If you try to act fly then Ill punk you I and I
When I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise to invade the media shame
Take it insult call me the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lees a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it OJ he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid the drug addict
If you missed me dont kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one
Verse Two BizMarkie
Ladahdi ladahda I like to say
You know me as the inhuman orchestra
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW

The man appointed rap King and Im here to stay
Im down to wreck your body Im not here to scrub
I gotta pass it over to my man Chubb
Verse Three Chubb Rock
From the glass clear era thats the point of the one
Be unique critique from the crumb me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it cheerio kid and here I go
Off beat slackin but the platinum mediocre rappers
With the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The acoustic suits it the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs well it should Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise super star in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild child in the rubadub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out with my rubber band
I can tell that you need me you dont want me to get paunchy
And me I dont want to catch no HIV

You living for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic I made her shit her draws
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol
I said Oh hell naw but yet its that too
You cant discrimahate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it whoo
To put that bitch in slower motion got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision
Is do you want to live or wanna exist
The game changes every day so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it

And I flow just like a brook a stream the rain
And I fly just like a bird up in the sky
And Ill surely die just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then one day it turns to clay
It blows away it finds a ray it finds its way
And there it lays until the rain and sun
Then I breathe just like the wind the breeze that blows

4579,"YEAH
Black niggaaaaaaaaaa
YEAH
Killa killa killa killa
Black nigga killa
Hate brought death
Around the block as the hollow points bust though the punks back
Raising gang feel no pain as I penetrate
Niggas fly deep as I strike a quick pace
I got the evil of a dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to my mankind
Born to kill Im wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hell raisers
Im 30 ot 6 with the scope
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat
As I bring anger
And release more danger from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow and puts lead in that niggas flesh
Aint no hope every nigga wants to be the nine milla on the trigga
The black nigga killa
Deep from the death as I crept
I can feel his Glock in the back of my neck
Im thinkin to myself what the fuck as I pause
I can feel my heart thumpin from my balls
Up against his gun what the fuck could I do
If I make a wrong move the nigga might shoot
My pops always warned me when I was comin up
If I play pussy Im bound to get fucked
Though bein broke as hell it be drivin me crazy
Hooked up with my niggas start jackin niggas daily
Fat sacks of dough to Daytons I got em
Slang em dirt cheap cause everything was profit
Now I got his nine on the back of my mind
As I watch my life pass right before my eyes
The shit that I done is all in my face
Reflections of death as I step with my 38
The black nigga killa
Which bitch made the statement
About the nigga busting caps sporting all black Ben Davis
Im out the door
My pagers blowin up I check my gat twice
Cause niggas like to jack on a late night
And as Im livin like a criminal
I try my best to keep my gang tight and stay away from punk niggas
Strikin down Broadway
I caught some niggas out of bounds from the
Upper MLK
Slowly crept from the cut at a quick pace
Aint no love in my heart all I feel is hate
So 25 with that L might be mando
Cause nigga Im killing for them gold things with that Zapco
I watch the terror in eyes as he backed up
Ease of the break pop that clutch and watch his chest bust
Wide open as I bounce in the night quicker
From the nine milla trigga
The black nigga killa

And kept on stompin
While yall motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites

Dropped four niggas now Im making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes Who you foolin
Yall niggas just phony

Yella Boys on your team so youre losing
Ayy yo Dre stick to producing

EazyE saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But Im a man and aint nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkkas Most
You could yell all day but you dont come close
Cause you know Im the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles but you still got one to go
With the LENCH MOB
And yall disgrace the CPT
Cause youre getting fucked out your green
By a white boy with no Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline

Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho so
I couldnt stop you from getting ganked
Now lets play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube it wasnt worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair Nah cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gangbanged by your manager fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and highheels
So dont believe what Ren say
Cause hes going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you Toby
Used to be my homie now you act like you dont know me
Its a case of divide and conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton but you moved to Riverside
So dont front MC Ren
Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It aint my fault one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga what you thinking bout
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
Cause you cant be the Nigga 4 Life crew

5708,"Dear Black Son theres people youve never met
Who fear and hate you for something that you never did
And these people are so selfconvinced
Sometimes they pull the trigger call that selfdefense
And in that sad insanity
Their fear is realer to them than your humanity
But thats their problem its not yours
Listen to your pop for a second
These are the confessions of a father broken hearted
Who dont know how to pull his only son out of a target
They lied when they said it was the bottom where you started
You were a king long before them ships departed
You are not defined by anybody elses crimes
You dont need to answer for what happens in their minds
You are not confined by their imaginary lines
You dont need permission to exist with the divine
In fact you dont need permission from no one including me
You need not do anything but be just breathe
Whatever you dream let it mean youre free
Tears on your cheek never made nobody weak
Sometimes we got to grieve let it burn let it bleed
Then let yourself heal pray to God that it will
Youve got a spirit that a bullet cant kill
That doesnt make it any less real
They say it takes a man to raise a man
Youre slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man whos slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Dear Black Son
Dear Black Son I cant protect you like I want to
I never judge you all I can do is love you
And thats all anyone can ever do is love you
All I can do is wonder how can anyone not love you
They recognize divine in you
So they try to find themselves by defining you
Theyre living in a myth that they dont want to lose
And now theyre too terrified to face your kind of truth
But every single time you shine its proof that they mightve threw a chain around your body never conquered you
They dont always honor you but they love your culture
Let me show you how to move when the laws approach you
Its best to keep your hands where they can see them
And try to understand that youre not even what theyre peeping
They dont see a sweet kid that loves his little sister
Their mind is seeing five hundred years of pictures
In fact they dont visualize a kid
They see grown man imagery mythic masculinity
But you are not their fetishes or fears
Nor my ambition and tears nothing can interfere
Weve got to trust our seeds once we sow them
We hold them when theyre growing
But we never really own them
We love up on them play with em pray for them
And cling very closely to them moments
They say it takes a man to raise a man
Youre slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man whos slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And her I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last

Its like Im in the dirt diggin up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
All it takes is one song on the radio youre
Right back on it reminding me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But Im coming for closure
Dont suppose an explanation Im owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh you thought it was over
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
Well Ive never recovered
But tonight bet you that what youre
Bout to go throughs tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges Mind saying Let it go fuck this
Hearts saying I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad
And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
Thought some time would pass and Id forget it Forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
May be gone but hes not forgotten
And dont think cause hes been out the picture so long that Ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya
Youre wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold
Have you any idea the shit that Ive gone through
Feelings I harbor All this pentup resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how Im doing
Letters you dont respond to em
Fuck it Im coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on ya
Poof then Im gone voosh
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
Ive been drivin around your side of this town
Like nine frickin hours and fortyfive minutes now
Finally I found your new address park in your drive
Feel like Ive been waitin on this moment all of my life
And its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and Im duckin on the side of your house
See its sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya but I aint here for your empathy
I dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
Its revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potentialI peeked Haha 
Continue to peep still bent low then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
All the way round to the back porch
Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
You dont plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue
Gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Ironys spectacular huh Now whos a faggot you punk
And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
Its just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it
Were in a car right nowwait here comes my favorite lyric
Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
Hows this for a publicity stunt This should be fun
Last album now cause after this youll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell
Bitch I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since youre in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits time is quite near
Hope we dont get stopped no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
As cops appear in my drivers side mirror
Oh God Police Agh 
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
New plan Stan
Slim Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car
Well gotta go almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro its for you Slim this is for him
And Frank Ocean oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
Im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
Im your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope its hopeless Im that denial that youre hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
Backs to the wall Im stackin up all them odds
Toilets clogged yeah cause Im talkin a lot of shit but Im backin it all up
But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
Im the ringing in your ears
Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
Grab for some water
But Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
Im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya
Every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona
Is half a facade and Matthew and Stans just symbolic
Of you not knowin what you had til its gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
Im the hindsight to say I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you dont stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
When its time to walk away Im every guilt trip
The baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
If theres anything you have left to say
Less it makes an impact then dont bother
So fore you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop A wallop 
So one last time Im back
Fore it fades into black and its all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh as we pick up where the last Mathers left off

But now Im in this bitch

Im loaded loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck em I feel like I got ten middle fingers
Im sippin sippin in this bitch and poppin uppers
Girl take this this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs you only see em when the cookie crumble
Real shit nigga my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride though swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on em
I never turn my back on em
Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be benchwarmers
The game aint easy but its fair nigga
Imma sit in this throne so long
Til its a fucking rocking chair nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair nigga
Said Relax Tune baby dont stress out
But I got a lot of shit on my mind though
She said Let that shit work itself out
Let that shit work itself out

Let it all work out let it all work out

They want a piece of me I aint the one thats serving slices
Please swallow I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit pussy niggas on that guilt trip
Itll be on in a heartbeat
You cant hear no pussy niggas shit skip
I fear God never fear men
Give back never give in
Beat odds never beat women
Keep an open mind let em peek in it
Reach highs never reach limits
Need minds I dont need plenty
This C5 this for BI and Left Eye and TBoz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young and I held my tongue
But with that tongue I just keep spitting
So it all worked out
And now Im in this bitch
And life said Tune you knew me for way too long
I never change you know I been this bitch
And then she said Let it all work out
Let it all work out let it all work out Yeah 
Let it all work out let it all work out
Tunechi you a monster
Looked in the mirror but you wasnt there I couldnt find ya
Im lookin for that big old smile full of diamonds
Instead I found this letter you aint finished writin
It read Im sorry for even apologizing
I tried compromising and went kamikaze
I found my mommas pistol where she always hide it
I cry put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me so I called my auntie
Hung up then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it and I woke up with blood all around me
Its mine I didnt die but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet
Yeah and he said
Let it all work out Yeah 
Let it all work out
Im still in this bitch 
Let it all work out
Yeah thank God cause Im still in this bitch 
Let it all work out
Let it all work out Phew 
Let it all work out
But he said Remember this 
Let it all work out
Let it all work out
Aint nobody else like you in this bitch 
Let it all work out Yeah 
Let it all work out
And dont forget what I did this bitch 
Let it all work out
Cant even remember when I didnt bitch 
Let it all
Let it all work out Yeah

Mamas gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can
Its a good thing you dont have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And youd lose it in the snow on the ground
Walking to town and find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
Boy youd better go home where its warm
Where you can
Live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can
And she can
Living on a dreams aint easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
Ah you take em in stride for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
Maybe a prayer
Making me strong where you belong
Where you can
Live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can

5807,"They told me I would never make it I would never achieve it
Reality is nourishment but people dont believe it
I guess its hard to stomach the truth like a bulimic
Its a dirty game and nobody is willin to clean it
But this is for the paraplegic people dreamin of runnin
Ladies married to men who dont please em dreamin of comin
Verbally murderous like David Berkowitz when Im gunnin
Some cowards on the Internet didnt think I would sell
Scared to talk shit in person cause they stuck in a shell
And couldnt understand the pain of bein stuck in a cell
Hell is not a place you go if youre not a Christian
Its the failure of your lifes greatest ambition
Its a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
I dont see the difference in between the wrong and the wrong
Soldiers emptyin the clips at little kids and they moms
Are just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
Humanitys gone smoked up in a gravity bong
By a DemocratRepublican Cheech and Chong
Immortal Technique you never heard me preach in a song
Im not controversial Im just speakin the facts
Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
And shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
And since lifes a gamble like the craps tables at Vegas
I freestyle my destiny its not written in pages
I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
As if our peoples history started with slavery
Painfully I discovered the shit they kept a secret
This is the exodus like the black Jews out of Egypt
I keep it reality based with the music I make
Blow up the truth in your face with the style I run with
Like the Navy missile that shot down Flight 800
Im like the Africans who came here before Columbus
And from the 1500s until after the morrow
I watched Latin America get raped in the sorrow
You see the Spaniards never left despus de Colon
And if you dont believe me you can click on Univision
I never seen so much racism in all of my life
Every program and newscast all of em white
Its like apartheid with 10 percent rulin the rest
That type of stressll make me put the fuckin tool to your chest
Step in my way nigga I wouldnt wanna be ya
I burn slow like pissin drunk with gonorrhea
Ill do a free show in North Korea burnin the flag
While J Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
Tryna confuse you makin it hard to follow this
Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous
You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
Sellin your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
But thatll never be me cause Im leavin the past
Like an abused wife with the kids leavin your ass
Like a drug addict clean and sober leavin the stash
Unbreakable Technique leavin the plane crash
Im out with the black box and I refuse to return
I spit reality instead of what you usually learn
And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice
Cause Im the only motherfucker that could change my life
Some people think I wont make it but I know that I will
Escape the emptiness cause that shit is slow and it kills
The flow and the skill I made yall believe it at last
You can make the future but it starts with leavin the past

5591,"My mellow Latee was kicking flavor
The RE posse said Yo Latifah we can do this
So I paused and took a thought
Then my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex
Cause Im in full effect
Queen Latifah is fiveoh on this set
Youve been begging and dying
For somebodys rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave you me
Im coolin teaching those needing schoolin
And the mic This mic in my hand Im rulin
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away
Some MCs act bold and arrogant
Vain and using each other to compete with
These subjects I pity
Cause their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme thats so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste
But dont consider biting
Theres penalties for those who dont do right
And just be reciting
Everyone elses word that took a lot of thinking
Its not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
Well mine are growing
Yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say
And even in spite of me
Brothers catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness
Just call me Your highness
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away
Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble
Youre begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious
The same as the pace
The crowds they love me
The brothers give only hugs
Their shrinktofit buttonflies fit quite snug
As a bug you know why Because Im bugging
Off the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex off the sounds that Im pumping
Im jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on just get into it
Dont lie and say youve been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away
The scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Dont step up in my face
You dont want to feel the taste
Dont try to play me out
Cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap
Sisters clocking my sound why
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen LATIFAH in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite
Dont make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
Suckers on the tip
Youre loving me youre leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on you know the time
Just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness

Representin Group Home shout out to Lost Boyz Def Squad
Charles Suitt Mr Sexx DJ Clue and Desert Storm
Lets drop it
Haha Hoo Canibus freestyle niggas know Clue
Yo I speak at frequencies dogs would have trouble hearin
Canibus is the lyrical version of German engineering
Raw metaphors keep you high for months
Fly around the Earth twice without refuelin once
Aint too many categories I can fit in when it come to spittin
Cause Im overqualified for the position
The laserguided lyrical hybrid
Creatin scripts so sick I gotta armwrestle my pen to write it
Dont get excited cause if I ever catch one of you wannabes bitin
Were gonna be fistfightin
So motherfuckers what you want I got the shotgun pumped
You feel like a frog nigga Then jump
I posses the lyrical ammo to battle
And rip any one of you warmblooded mammals to shambles
I make examples of you and eat a mouth full of ya crew
The type of MC you cant outdo
Ill battle you on the net Ill battle you in the flesh
Ill battle you over the phone you can call me collect
Ill battle you for the respect Ill battle you over a blank cheque
Ill battle you with a gun to my neck
Ill battle you standin over the toilet with my dick out
Ill battle you jugglin a hand grenade with the pin out
In a stolen car with the VIN number ripped out
Drinkin a Guinness Stout doin a 360 spinout
I stay righteous like Farrakhan puffin on the marijuan
You understand where Im comin from
You number one Then Im negative two
Basically nigga that means Im still better than you
Basic mathematics the verbal mechanics of rhymin
Behold I crush a piece of coal and create a diamond
On the microphone Im sicker than those
Whove AcquiredImmuneDeficiencySyndromes
And every word I utter for hiphop lovers
Will reflect forever like two mirrors facin each other
The baddest MOther FUcker
Let me break the style down so you dont have to wonder
I walk the BLock with GLock COcked
Tryin to get the DROp on the COps
Blow spots capsize boats shipwreck yachts
Headshots hit you at 300 nautical knots
You callin the cops complainin about the hiphop
Gettin Benjamins like The LOX it dont stop
Eheh eheh put away your burners you cant serve us
My whole camp is allergic to bein murdered
Metaphors is proof I got more than just a couple screws loose
Latinos call me the Black Jess
So for all who believe the telekinesis of Jesus
I touch a paraplegic and heal him

7655,"Back in the days was kinda crazy kid I started out with nothin
Wasnt livin like Thanksgiving I was turkey without the stuffin
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the po house
Say mama caught the drama she would bleed tryin to feed fo mouths
Wasnt rockin Girbauds I barely had clothes and when it snow
And temperatures droppin below zero you know I froze
No CDs a black and white TV I see thats about to retire
With a hanger for the antenna turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin in my cabinet but cans of Raid
Im knockin on my neighbors door to borrow a cup of sugar for my KoolAid
I wasnt freshly dipped my gear was straight ripped
Im trippin cause my winter coat got lost buttons and zippers that wouldnt stay zipped
I never remembered a dinner the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black I had KitKats on top of Cracker Jacks
Walkin the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldnt speak I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin humped from the stunts I always struck out
The one you like says take a hike if you cant pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world 
Blowin up blowin up in the world

Black I dont disown her Im just a kid from Corona
With a GED diploma with more ribs showin than Tony Romas
In order to get straight I gots to to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin down on the corner slangin fat rocks to bottles with the black tops
For cops got my shorty watchin my back hops
Makin mad lucci bought up Louis Vuitton Gucci
Hoochies callin me boochi while they smooch me givin up the coochie
Now Im a felon started sellin and splittin melons
Some started jellin and tellin police just cause I was swellin
Hangin out on the corner playin ceelo rollin for half a kilo
Yo youll never see G low or goin below
Yeah straight gettin fortunate as long as fiends was torchin it
It started gettin hot around the block the cops was scorchin it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
This business in drugs is gettin too risky
So now I just lamp collect stamps snatch tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby Im blowin up in the world

I got put on by DJ Polo cut the record Its a Demo
And started chillin in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin no time for pains sportin gold chains and rings
Clockin money and fame nothin changed Im still the same
Just spendin twenties and tens at women pullin on my linen
Then grinnin cause I was winnin in this game from the beginnin
The lyrical skills was kinda ill gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build known for rappers run and go write wills
And turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low now I puff on cigars and blow Os
So catch a flashback of a G Rap track attacked like a head crack
Get smacked through your cap with the lead black
And heres a new cut for poobutt rappers hangin from off my two nuts
Like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G Rap dont sleep money unless its with ya girl

Feel the fire whenever we act up
Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery
So forget about it when you hear about it

Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm
Every murder is a structure
Every time I hit you niggas with another jam be blacking

Now Im back to beat you in the head Ill bring another banger
With my nigga Twist everything we do be up to wanger

Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top
Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block

Motivated for murder whenever I act up
A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up
Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up

Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang em
And get em and do it every single time I hit em
When I do it it just gotta be accurate
I am attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking in back and in front
Cause every time we in the place we fill it to capacity
I be coming with it he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid it gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey the prodigy and Imma be the one to prove it

Earth wind and fire sounded so heavenly
Ohio players and Curtis Mayfield
Aretha Franklins picture on a playbill
Al Green in a tight suit all white
Minnie Riperton high notes all night
Moms even had a box full of 45s
Put the needle down yea that sounds sorta live
Sound like the kind of groove I could rap over
Got drunk off the beat then I was back sober
Bring that part back yea Imma murder that
Donny Hat on the track with Roberta Flack
Hide records

Cant explain that I was just borrowing it
Moms on a rampage lookin for her Parliament
And Donny Hathaway feelin like a castaway
Hiding in grandmoms room more than half the day

And nobody home now Imma be a crying kid
But its seeming like Im safe for the time being
My uncle gettin all the blame far as Im seeing
I just gotta lay low like a snake belly
Its a sticky situation like grape jelly
Im on the titanic or some other boat
Got my mother and her brother at each others throat
You better hope mommy never find out
Cause if she does then thats your ass
You know damn well if you touch one
And you get caught thatll be your ass

And the year is
Ninteenseventy Something

With a black and red nap sack
Came to bring the vinyl back
I put it back before anybody notices
He said close call I said yea I know this is
But I got away with it like the perfect crime
And made the fresh tape man it was worth the time
An aggravation and stress almost made a mess
Shed a found out its me she would of laid to rest
But Im over like a fat rat
That was smart its a good thing you hid em in that backpack
It feels so good to get that out the way
Now Im out the door back out to play
Im about to say these are the good time like Chic
And then I hear my mom shriek
Duval
Get back in here uhoh 
How did my record get scratched

Go get my belt
Cmon ma

2764,"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame
You say one love one life
When its one need in the night
One love we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you dont care for it
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well its too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
Were one but were not the same
We get to carry each other carry each other
One
Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much More than a lot
You gave me nothing now its all I got
Were one but were not the same
Well we hurt each other then we do it again
You say love is a temple love a higher law
Love is a temple love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I cant be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love one blood
One life you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters brothers
One life but were not the same
We get to carry each other carry each other
One

6829,"One two in the place to be Im MC Donald D
And in the house Nat the Cat the Syndicate Mobb boss
And standing after me IceT the OG Gangster
Syndicate is about to jump off on a buckwild freestyle
Ice drop some dope shit
Everybody step back from the mic cause I set it off
All playing the wall its time to sweat it off
Anybody with static awww please try
Ill do you like Godfather 3 and do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees with their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I dont rap with girls in my LP
I dont beg for pussy I love the ladies and they love me right back
Now whos the mack
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this microphone and leave suckers unconscious
And if you think you got a S in your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back your front I always hit dont bunt
Crazy posse when Im out on a duck hunt
Emcee IceT answers to no one
Load my rhymes and cock them like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A low stroll and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me and thats right they oughta
Before my crew gets to their daughters
Ha ha ha yo Nat the Cat youre next baby
Yo why dont you get on this Mic
And jump off like suicider off the Brooklyn Bridge baby
Yeah youre a player kick it
Do you know me
Right thats why carry the mic
Im not flashing my American Express
Im playing my cards closed to my vest
My name that you say what Im vesting
Listen up and listen close and listen for the lesson
Black panther resisting that situation
Executing with tact jumping exact
Ripping up slack on the tack
86 didnt mack turn tales and back up at stack the jack
Cause Im venerish Nat The Cat unloading like the million tons of TNT
Yes thats me you see you wanna be but cant MC
Cause on the real the science the knowledge behind your capacity
The simplicity thats how I say
But I said it you know you wonder how did he say that anyway
To you its complex when I flex for flex flood
Stimulates the opposite sets and thats dope
Though why you cant cope
Im throwing you a rope Im about to draw you as you dont rock the boat
Or you be back inside the ocean this time it wont float
You be stuck on the bottom with other suckers I got them
Sporting to see me woof while Im banking the loot
Just off the end you travel around the world in a fly silk suit
My style is custom made suede and leather
Down to fly by in any weather
Donald D the smuggler goin for the juggler
Firing wild out here police sirens
Whats up Do you wanna die by
The Syndicate sniper tonight on a fly by
Swing while I came into the tune that grip ya
Flip ya trip ya rip ya I keep dipping ya
In and out back and forth up and down
Me be sleeping with the heat I cant fuck around
City sounds I proceed with caution
Teach you that BSCs another fortune
Im here to sink your brain Ill take the thought you think
Make you walk the plank to watch you sink
The MOB needs a hitman
Well here Im Uncle Cocaine floods your membrane
As the black ball swings from the chain
Learn to steal learn to wheel and deal
When things got hot caps got peeled
MCs come on step with your rhyme
Whats up put your life on the line
I shall robe them headlock choke them
While you walk them when the Syndicte Sniper get stalk them
Red Beam on target you cant dodge it
Wouldnt wanna be ya ABC ya
Aww yeah man that was MC IceT
Nat The Cat and Donald D you know what Im saying
In your face for 1991 and did something
We outta here for sure it was a homicidal fly by
So peace to Syndicates elders

Were all precious in his sight
And a rose is still and always will be a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
There was a rose I knew I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth hey hey

Steal her honey then forget her

He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power what I am is what I am 
Now believe me when I tell you that Ive been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you its you nobody else
And now youre so tough tryin to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin and flossin tryin to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh oh yeah

Shes cryin you cant hear her

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see youre lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Dont believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl love yourself enough to know
That without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
And without him your life goes on

Look at what youve got with ya
A painted picture
A Mona Lisa in disguise with bedroom eyes
The kind that always gets you
Young dumb hot rookies
Hot for the nookie
Young and dumb quick of the tongue
And dont know how to boogie
Cause once you get in the groove
You cant stick and move
A little slip of the lip and the youngn is whipped
I want to let you know you
Got a lot to learn in this world
Actin like the Duke of Earl
Sportin your new stuff as everybodys old stuff
And you callin that your girl

And your pockets were no joke
When you asked her to hang out with you back then she laughed so hard she choked
But soon as you got your ride
Shes under your arm at your side
She said remember what I said I didnt like you before
I lied
She already done chucked your face
Now heres a typical case
Of a man whose world evolves around a girl
His brain below his waist
Now you remember how the homeboys did her
Shes out for the highest bidder

And treats him like hes royal
Simply put the hand in foot treatment have got him spoiled
Cause he still has to mess around
With every other girl in town
And when your girl finds out what youre really about
Shes heartbroke and let down
Cause the love you had you ruined it
Shes cryin and boohooin it
Shes too sweet to cheat but she knows you cheat
Whats to stop her from doin it

Then ya got those saps
With the weak weak raps
Nothin to say theyd rather pay

You know how much they spend
On one girlfriend
So many dollars on so many girls they call him George Washington
You know what youve been given
Your girl and how shes livin
Sweet though with a dollar bill
Now she cant stop sniffin

And shes your girl who knows

6068,"Yeah now you see what the Lord doin
Rippin pages out the book I had to make the story fluent
Thanks to Marshall Im sober doin what I enjoy doin
Im puttin Chavis Chandler on had to at least pay it forward to him
Yeah every other day another star is born
And thats to freshen the decayin of the art form
Fuck with my commas shit will be quick
Got whats in my pocket out of the dirt filthy rich
I stuck to my promise to momma stay focused
Double entendre Im tryna vocally smoke you you will be missed
The hocus the pocus magician doing tricks in this miserable business
Who spit loyalty forgiveness through biblical scripts
Of morals and wisdom paintin pictures of this
Historical war of attrition whos just the dopest the wokest
Im five years sober
Trauma from my childhood constantly haunts me til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet with thoughts of my side chick in high heels
Cause I didnt want her I needed her though I didnt want her
Im hot as July no lie I wouldnt lie in a sauna
Invest in the truth dont expect me to buy into moments
They done took the charts over so now yall scared of them shook niggas
Jamal Crawford couldnt crossover and sell me them Wolf tickets
Uhh Best Rapper Alive broadcasts in five
Four three two one
Im fly as a dive in the sky in a harness
Anyone alive sleepin on me can die in pajamas
Police call me a threat to society though I am a promise
I am a oneofone like Id say a Isaiah Thomas
You cant fathom thinking deep enough to sink the abyss
You think you Pac Im thinkin of sinkin your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I cant fathom is why the preacher is rich
How to think in the moderation and turn a drink to a sip
Im private when I fly I ball out like Bron do
You in the game but you sit and coach like Tyronn Lue
Me and my soldiers we just out here mobbin like old Italians
Snatching your homies necklace to rock it with your medallion
Over these groceries Im toetotoe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this 44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contraesque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn conscious steps
The booze already made me lose I cant go out like Im Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standin in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware pair of Pumas on
Looking like Im aboard a Lear headed to uniform
Im so lyrically rare I spearheaded the unicorn
I was born a bold one sugarcoated
All the way Im livin put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me they say Aint nobody did this nah
And if they dont they shit been off just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I wont break a fool they dont want me to blow
But every single show they hand out like I owe em
Already paid my dues and wordings uh
But if I said it then they still wont know so I wont waste my time on you
And speakin on the level that ya never on the way they hatin so incredible
My writings on the wall to you its so illegible
Im invincible youre sleepin on me Ima stay woke
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Pull your panties down
Take your wig off let me see your bald head
Thats right I got you on Kodak
Your pictures are goin out to Black Tail
Youre gonna be a star
Yeah
I heard you quit rap your wife went back to porno flicks
You turned drag queen a call girl doin tricks
Nighttime prostitute kid Imma take your loot
I heard you queer now like Boy George blowin flutes
With high heels you stole your moms birth control pills
You on some new stuff I heard about that sex change
You got a vagina your grandmother think its strange
New eyeliner you was flirtin with a gay designer
Your girl felt mines and pulled off her Calvin Kleins
I saw Tampax gonorrhea red stop signs
I looked at her and said Mmm put your panties back on
Then jerked off to Foxy Brown when her verse was on
I wanna stand back and bust nuts at your butts
Your girl is cocked up with lollipops doggie style
I feel Im dealin with plastic watch these fake smiles
Yeah meet my left and my right
Keep it real represent what My nuts 2X 
I got utensils back up kid yo guard your rectum
Im crazy out here mental man dont respect him
You now in pain your mom just had the abortion
Big head Boo I put some roaches on your whole crew
Have you scared with crack pipes your family throwin doodoo
Wear out your welcome your little girl sex desires
Have you handicapped some friends of mine blow your tires
Like Alfred Hitchcock the ghost stands on your block
With nine mils for drug addicts I keep triggers cocked
You on some methane my witchcraft is on your brain
Blow out your headpiece and break out quick on the plane
Seal up your coffins and celebrate with champagne
Get my drink Absolut cranberry juice
Paranoid by rug spots you see the purple moose
You smokin sherm or what I paralyze that butt
Lick my dhead you girls still pee in the bed
Yo take that wig off yo punk let me see that caesar
Keep it real represent what My nuts 3X 
I gets more wreck than kids in babys Pampers
Your wife is banned for leavin bras in my hampers
That heffers ugly plastic why you still bug me
Im on Melrose the coast takin sun strolls
Black girls with weaves white girls with flat butts
With the name HOMO spelled in your name
You was a woman one time man I know your game
With panties stuck up sweat leakin in your crotch
Collard greens you wet pig you cant eat that much
I shut you down your whole face two oclock
Have your girl on sunset in Dennys suckin cock
With white pumps up blonde wigs rottin in the trunks
That homeless monkey Barbie doll crystal junkie

Tie your tubes back my scope is on your asscrack

Cause the walls start shaking the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching and we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me all night long

5575,"I mean Sometimes I see things I guess cause Im a ghost I see ghostly things
Thought I saw something that wasnt there but it was there
Theyre as far as the eye can see
as far as I can see though 
There are shadows haunting me
I see shadows 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
and Im looking real far even if Im asleep 
There are shadows haunting me
aint that something 
Something in the shadows
Maybe its the Pharaohs
Coming to spread the light cause the visions so narrow
Maybe its the killas in the cut with the barrels
Getting high but cant fly without the eye of a sparrow
Fatigued and fatigue ready for battle
My word could move herd like the cattle
Try to stay hard lifes fragile meaning you could lose any moment
My cranium is like Damiens no Omen
I dont bare the mark of the beast
Just the heart of the beast
Rally for em when its dark in the streets
Just a ice cold nigga that be sparking the heat
Tryna make it through the struggle just to say at the least
If they coming tell em come now
Sunset sundown
I dont put my gun down
And I aint tryna run clown
I keep something in the barrels
Fully loaded up knowing theres something in the shadows
Theyre as far as the eye can see
Point blank period get high and hallucinate 
There are shadows haunting me
Stress is building up 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
I smell murder every time that the wind blows 
There are shadows haunting me
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling 
Something in the shadows maybe its the reaper
Maybe its the devil trying to put me in the sleeper
Maybe its God trying to tell me that Im deeper
Ill know soon have faith in a goon
I broke date mad years trying to race with the moon
If the sun give me energy
Why I pull my gun on my enemies
And wait for nightfall to drink Hennessy
Cups of Courvoisier times the same on this Swatch
Or Cartier unless you set your watch different
We got eyes but our watch different
Be on the block different
Be on the low in the spot different
I got bars but the Glock kicking
Im in tune with the moon
And the wolves that howl at it
You could play the game if you foul at it
Tell the pigs its a fair game
I get high and kick my Nike Airs off in first class on the airplane
I wont rest til the day I see the angel of death
And tell him wish me the best
If I dont get it this life may I get it the next
Never settle for less
Street niggas say I did it the best which is true though
Coke since the days of Menudo
Higher than Pluto
Something in the shadows but I aint got a clue though I got no clue 
Im getting drunk off the booze
Im getting high just recording with Poose
Have dreams about the Lord and his crew
Or the devil and his boys
I have voices in my head but I can never make the noise stop cant stop can it 
They always singing on a carol
Far as they can see know theres something in the shadows

Shouldve been in an asylum the way he funeral parlour em
Bottom bitch with the healthy bottom
My bells no cotton
Come from a slum off a strip made of legends
See her face with fresh enough mirror paint on that fresh Benz
King of my city I run for mayor election here on
He step in the scene you to the fifth wing what happened
The don is session brunette and blond sex and Im on rest
And my weapon I hit em with arm injections
Firearm your direction no arm wrestling peasants
Palming that bread he got off on the own connections

Fling skin grin while them plotting for you true
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Me a tell you dem nuh know 
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Fi be real them nuh have a clue 
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose its those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition they do
Oh
Forgive them Father for

Why every Indian wanna be the chief
Feed a man till he full and he still want beef
Give me grief try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase I must decrease
If I treat you kindly does it mean that Im weak
You hear me speak and think I wont take it to the streets
I know enough cats that dont turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you cant list them
How you gon idolize the missing To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming gunning I stand position
Ls known the mission since conception
Lets free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle
March through these streets like Soweto uhh
Like Cain and Abel Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas backstabbers do this
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves to themselves
A friend once said and I found to be true
That everyday people they lie to God too
So what makes you think that they wont lie to you
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Forgive them forgive them 
Forgive them Father for
They know not what they do Forgive them forgive them 
Gwan like dem love you while dem rip you to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart and leff you fi dead

6403,"I am content to die for my beliefs
So cut off my head and make me a martyr
The people will always remember it
No they will forget
A man who walks with God can walk anywhere
Hence I fear nothing
The point of guerilla war is not to succeed
Its always been just to make the enemy bleed
Deprivin the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need
Bullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave
The only way a guerilla war can ever be over
Is when the occupation cant afford more soldiers
Until they have to draft the last of you into the service
And you refuse because you dont see the purpose
The only way to counter the insurgents that are wellequipped
Is to paint the people fightin for freedom as terrorists
Then find a faction lookin for foreign investment
Install them in power and murder any objections
You cant stop a revolution from breathin
So to beat em they offer people the illusion of freedom
But when youre done dreamin and wake up tortured for treason
Then you can see them hidin behind the god they believe in
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
During the night before the start of the dawn
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
Guerilla war when the army is gone
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
So Id rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless
I dont need the circus or the day of national observance
I need you to think for you and stop bein a servant
Pawns only move a square in the game that theyre used in
And realize it too late like the shooting of Huey Newton
Or Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allende
Slaughtered by the powerhungry branches of their own gente
Ghandi wasnt killed by Pakistani nationals
He was assassinated by a Hindu radical
And Che Guevara rebel to a US continent
Was sold to the CIA by Bolivian communists
Wasnt Yitzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist
And Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence
Malcolm X was seen as a threat to the FBI
But to blast em they used Muslims from the NOI
Even the 35th President of the Republic
Was murdered by factions of his own government
So now that its proven that a soldier of revolution
Or head of an empire disguised in a constitution
Can not escape the retribution or manipulation
Of the selfappointed rulers of the planets corporations
So Ima need every generation to put your hands up
Cause you can only get em off your back when you stand up
Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
During the night before the start of the dawn
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
Guerilla war when the army is gone
Thats the place a martyr is born Motherfucker its on 
I was a man blessed by God
To survive some of the worst circumstances
I had many things a beautiful woman I loved a home money
And I gave it all up to bleed and to die free
Sometimes I look back on that life
And I wonder what it wouldve been like
And in moments of weakness I think about trading it
Then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality
And I realize that Im in the heart of a war
And thats the place a martyr is born

Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand

You made a first class fool out of me
But Im as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
Id never seen your face

Its a family affair and then were out of here
There is no doubt here cause this is our year
So flex to a Queen LatifahDe La Soul sound
Go ahead mama get down 
It was inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible
We never put ourselves on any pedestal
But the rhyme is so good its practically edible Say what 
So check the sounds of Mama Zulu

And if youre wondering why I got kids so big
They werent born from the body they were born from the soul

Probably the only artist who can father time John Amos
Rapper God erupted out of a ComicConcano
Committin lyrical homicide while beside Premo
To the downers Im Drano to the genre Im Thanos
Any spitter think he sicker than that I have the antidote
Take it back to when it was eighths in the pack
Kidnap you over that lil rap you wrote leave your family taken aback
By the handsome quote that I left on that ransom note
I aint one of these dudes who be computer screen beefin
Gorilla nigga killin his Twitter TL verbal abusin females
Bill Maher use the term nigga so loosely
Cause truthfully he know that he be usin it on the DL
Louis CK know he can use it in front of Pookie
But know damn well that he wouldnt use it in front of DL
White kids graduate to relationships with a ton of perks
Black kids just aggravated and had to take a ton of Percs
You come to church the 1st and 21st and when it come to dirt
Gucci aint the only ones puttin black faces on front of shirts
Black women wanna be built like cartoon characters Eric Cartman
That bears a strikin resemblance to Sara Baartman
Now Google that when you get a chance
You gon find out Americas heartless
Remember the effort has to go into the art not the wave
Everybody talking bout they own their masters
But if the music dont age well it dont matter
Its like you own a hundred percent of nothing
Know your value
The Butcher comin nigga
All them times you gave em your best got you complicatin your stress
Cash rules your last move got em contemplatin your next
Im the one behind the wheel when them conversations go left
I need violence Rasheed Wallace Im okay with a TEC
Whats the difference from a nigga who lived it and storytellers
Of course we felons sold a brick whiter than Tori Spelling
Roll with killers nobody on my block was poorer than us
I put a fork in the pot and got a euphoric feeling uh
Young heathens clap tools over VVS jewels
White kids pull heaters at school wanna CBS News
Became a legend for the skeptics who aint believe he that dude
And for mornings I never ate unless they feed me at school uhhuh
Servin out pots had me turnin out blocks
Its Griselda nigga you know we The Firm without Fox
Everything about timing and I was stern on my clock
Cause niggas out now grindin tryna earn what I got uh
Stick to the script my advantage was hustle
So Im sayin off the muscle Im here and careers I could cancel a couple
The shooter cross the Atlantic to touch you
Rubber bands in the duffle with both hands full I aint panic I juggle
Im very confident yall barely poppin it huh
Yall niggas treat every project chick like Kerry Washington
Jail backstabbin to Hell I took a consequence
A yard big enough at the crib to bury hostages

7563,"One two three kick it
Ayo Dre whats goin on man Whats goin on
Ay what chall gonna do for this last record
Nah tell me what chaall gonna do
Okay you want me to do the intro Aight
Parental discretion is advised for the moment
While Im gettin candid now understand it
Aint too typical in any way
Though the pro on the mic is the DOtotheC this is an intro
I know The DOC makes you wanna take a Valium
So buy a bucket cause upcomin is my album
And for the record meanin my record check it
Listen to the single and youll be like Yo I gotta get it
But in the meantime listen to the rhyme
Of the Dr Dre played with NWA
Yellas on the drum roll rockin the beat
Ayo Dre Where you gonna take this shit man
Ayo lets take it to the street WORD UP 
Let em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckas to stop guessin
Cause I dont give a fuck about radio play
Observe the English I display
Lyrics for the adults children have been barred
And scarred from listenin to somethin so muthafuckin hard
Dope Pumpin thats so my shit will never falter
Yo its Dre so fuck the Mind of Minolta
Psycho like no other muthafucka
So step to me wrong GO for what you NO
But be warned never will I leave like a regular
Cause Im a little better than the regular competitor
I use to see em on stage
Earnin money like a thief but without a gauge
Until I got full of clockin the lame gettin pull
They said you wasnt gon get paid Nah thats bullshit
They like it stylistic and I enchant the crowd like Im a mystic
CCCC CCCcameras are flashin when Im in action
A photo or fresh with the flair for fashion
Pure simplicity see its elementary
You hear one of the hardest muthafuckaz this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise and they guys
Parental discretion is advised
Ren is most extremely high performance
The black hat cause I worn this cause its like enormous
Some shit I dont take it not even in a toilet
And shit from a suckas put in a pot and Ill boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe the muthafuckaz will learn
Im not a sub cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince cause Im a principal
Im engineerin the shit that youre hearin
Cause when it comes to power Im powersteerin
Silly you say I say youre silly when you say it
Rushin to the eject to put my shit in and play it
Its like Apollo but Im not an amateur
And Im not givin a fuck while Im damagin ya
Its for the record so Rens lyrics is gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved Id win it
Possession is mine and Im the holder
Cause a nigga like Ren dont give a fuck cause Im older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it Parental discretion is advised
I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
Cause if you fail to see read it in Braille itll still be funky
So whats next is the flex of a genius
My rapidstuttersteppin if you seen this
Dope you hope that I dont really mean this
But if Play made a greater hightop fade
Its not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guessed it was a test of a different style
Its just another muthafucka on the pile
Drivin your ass with the flow of the tongue
You hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung to your attention
By the hardest muthafuckin artist that is known for lynchin
Any sucka in a minute stagger em all
When I start flowin like Niagara Falls
Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when Im mad and then my tail rattle
I get low on the flow so let your kids know
When I bust parental discretion is a must
Little did they know that I would be arrivin
And its surprisin rockin it from where I been
But its the E here to take no mistakes will be made
In the trade where funky ass records are bein played
Fuck the regular Yo as I get better the
Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
So I get em hot thinkin theyre gonna get it
As they sit rubbin their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny but
Theres no service of beef without money
So slip the Cnote and you can choke
On a wingdingdingaling down your throat
Foreplay to me aint shit
When you spread em Im ready then you can get the dick
Of the Ez if you can deal with the size
But if you cant parental discretions advised
Shut the fuck up

Fifteen years a lot of love is missin
I done already showed Im not above the dissin
Imma take what Im owed won wait til Im old
The game got rules and yall breakin the code
Yall dont really think I can be hot in the club
Yall think Im washed up like I got in the tub but
Im keepin it poppin the streets watchin
Im keepin em locked and the beat knockin
Hear me comin with this song that I brung in
DaddyO told me this when I was still a youngun
Aint nothin like hip hop music

They walk in the store I love when they cop it
Make you other rappers struggle to top it
But this man flow with the greatest ease
Never did care about the haters please
He done paid his dues paid his fees
He done stayed overseas made his Gs
But now I got a wife and she bad as Halle
Her moms is a militant dad is rowdy
The fans kind of act like they glad Im outtie
But they prolly sittin at home sad and pouty
You show me some love Imma show it right back

My limo drivers white my attorney black
Show me some love like Im Bernie Mac

Uptown Bronx and them crooks in Queens
I work like a maid when she cooks and cleans
Cuz its about to be a wrap from the looks of things
The game is changed the game is strange
The game is lame and it aint the same
But thats how it is you can ask Giz
You can ask Biz we did it for the kids
Listen here this is different here
If you got an eye for detail and efficient ear
I wont disappear Imma keep on givin
Imma keep on livin Imma keep bein driven
Im down to earth and Im close to ground
And spit shit better than most around
This how hip hop is supposed to sound
Tear them other cats posters down now

6562,"Im about to take this beat and teach you bout the agony of defeat
In this football game in the street
And no it aint two hand touch its rough tackle
When niggas ball on your block and they bust at you
The fields full of players and they all trying to score
The whole team sits on the bench in the down pour
Cause no matter the weather the game dont stop
Competing with other teams that reign on top
Your offense gotta be cats with no conscience
Nononsense niggas with no options
That know how to carry that rock
Make the handoff and run off the block
Its hard to get first down when your new in this rough town
You sell a pound its a touchdown
And niggas see the pigskin they blast cops
So federal agents dress as mascots
Niggas hold weight but its not for lifting
The only white lines is the ones niggas sniffing
I know it sounds a bit different the only quarter is a quarter ki
If that aint a penalty it oughta be
And the concession stand is so sick
Serving you the cat rat and dog on a stick
But if you ask why somebody got slain
Yo its just an unfriendly game
The game dont stop cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what Im saying
Its just an Unfriendly Game
This aint America is it
This aint America is it
Where can I be
Yo ayo its Monday night
We on some watch the game shit
But I can go outside and still see the same shit
Cause look theres a bunch of niggas in a huddle
Looks like they calling the play
Come on kids dont be all in the way
Cause thats Pookie he the fucking quarterback
Cause he like to use the shotgun if he dont I know he got one
And thats Budda he the fucking running back
Cause he always say he gone quit
And he always wind up running back
The rest of them
Ill just say they play the line
Cause they like to protect Pookie and Pookie make them stay in line
And if they make a wrong move they penalized
Not by the referee but by Pookie brother Jeffery
And Jeff dont touch shit he sit and watch
Oversees the whole block from his own private luxury box
He the one that makes the deals happen
Smoking big cigars while his stars are in the field scrapping
But tonight the line of scrimmage got penetrated
The block got raided and everybody got traded
Now they wearing stripes in a pen
Guess thats how the game go
Nigga you dont know
Highlights at 10
Wednesday police arrested 12 men in a downtown drug raid
The cartel known on the streets as the Sharks
Was transporting large amounts of marijuana
In shipments of little league football equipment
Theres a new team in from out of town
Whats the sound
Out of bounds
And the front line niggas stay ready for the blitz sonny
So you wont make a sack of money
And every now and then somebody drops the ball
And the next team be right there to take it all
Now somebody new is trying to make a score in your territory
Its the same old story
And if you want your corner back you better wear a vest
Just in case you gotta catch a bullet to the chest
Believe me that shit can be a humdinger
Cause every quarterback in this leagues a gunslinger
The halftime shows kinda ill
Hood rat bitches dancing to Dru Hill
Another nigga down and out
A crackhead with no name yo
Its just an unfriendly game
The game dont stop cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what Im saying
Its just an Unfriendly Game
This aint America is it
This aint America is it

Who woulda ever thought same niggas

You are the same nigga though 
Same nigga that couldnt get the deal
Now Im the hottest nigga wit a deal
You aint changed a bit 
Yo niggas never got nothin good to say quick to blame
Fore you judge me feel my pain
You know it aint a vest in the world that could shield my reign
You aint got money for the gas bitch get out the range
Got welcomed to the game wit like 4 mil and change
Niggas feelin like I changed but Im feelin the same
So who cares if they beg to differ
When all them niggas that beg to differ
Is cokeheads and sniffers
Take me for example least I made it
You think niggas in the hood should appreciate it
By time its happy birthday its gon be belated
When you me everything you do get exaggerated
You miss a nigga pound they gon say you flipped out
Take a piss in the street they say you pulled your dick out
As a youth its just a lot of shit I wanna live out
Got a lot of friends but only had a few when I was without
Same niggas I was starvin couldnt get a crumb from
Sometimes I think where all these motherfuckers come from
I needed money for school couldnt get no ones from
Got jumped in the park and couldnt get the guns from
Instead of rollin wit a clique roll wit my sis
Hell no these motherfuckers cant hold my stick
You think I care if they get mad I dont owe them shit
Wanna hold sumthin hold my dick nigga
We might be from a different hood
But we the same niggas

Been through a lot of shit so Im glad to be grown
But yo where were these freaks when I had no jeeps

Cross from PS 92 7th and 8th
Asked you for dough and you said No dead in my face
But now that Im on its like I owe everybody somethin
All my niggas dead so everybody frontin
Same kids went to Catholic school is dealers
And same niggas had no heart is now killers
Sometimes I reminisce on what I said in the mist
But even when I dream it wasnt better than this
But actually the niggas who would scrap for me
Or go as far as getting guns and clap for me
Aint even here to get a platinum plaque for me
I talk to them but they dont talk back to me
I aint know you that long so aint much I can ask of you
And when I reminisce I cant take it back wit you
I cant ask Yo what happen to my nigga Black or Q

Aint fuckin wit my sister cuz Im mad at my mom
Blink sayin That aint you wit a gat in your palm
But Blink its either that or be harmed
So the doctor give me pills for the wound stitch my flesh
Give a nigga last wish so he could pick his death
So my sister wanna rap and I wish her the best
But I would never wanna wish her my stress
Cause its like when I hurt yall laugh
They put me on every forecast sayin that I bought ass
So I drink a tall glass before I spaz
Then I take it like a man and let it all pass
I wanted big bucks no whammys understand me
I show niggas love and niggas underhand me
Then they wonder why I want no family
What I need a hooker for gettin head from
And I fear when New Years come cuz it might be the year
A good nigga die cuz when you good life aint fair
Like you call on the saints but the saints dont hear
You could cry to the Lord its like Christ dont hear
So instead of hood winking I give you the plain facts

5586,"At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 1 reasons youll never be this raw
My crew is representing for BK dont play
Or you might have to get Crime Watch around your way
Cause Brooklyn keep on taking it still from way back
Say black trying to get that fortune like Sajak
There must be at least twenty reasons you cant win and
In this rap game youre hopeless heres a top ten
10s very simple and plain its petty crime
Its only 94 when you wrote your first rhyme
And now you think you got more skill than power tools
But never could your feet fit up in our shoes
You only got one delivery
Onedimensional rappers is dead as chivalry
Dont get your spot blown up block sewn up
I lift MCs to tone up rip your zone up
I got more flavors than womens douche
Make ends with Mexicans and rock dreads in Flatbush
9 you cant see mine cant find mine
Cant do mine step to mine when my crew find
A frontingass nigga we get in this
You dont want to get beat and boxed like Biz
You aint wild cause you run with wild kids
Now the chorus is gonna tell you what 8 and 7 is
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
6 I bury that ass like Halle
All up on tracks like a trolley my golly
Like Bob Marley we jammin by all means
And real gangsters dont talk shit in magazines
5 never judge a rapper by the song he make
Some of the coolest rapping niggas will drop your ass in a lake
And on the other hand some of them screaming Keep it real
Their videos the only time they ever busted steel
4 you dont faze me this aint Star Trek
I know where you park your cars at as far as that
Beef thats going on in all these spots
In parking lots niggas pop more shit than shots
Funny dummy lyrics dont stun me
If I was your only pair of pants you still couldnt run me
Out this rap game its INC for life
Niggas gonna know soon cause Brownsvilles trife
All up in the mix like blenders
Offenders life enders whatever genders dont offend us
Coming at you gonna catch you and when we find you
Dont lose count let me remind you
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
One two one two this be number trey
Might be in the game but I dont think you wanna play
Im coming with the flav getting more rich than Bey
I say this Master jam more than Jay
And two is my crew is coming with the newest
Cant do us knock your teeth out trying to cue us
You want to step to us come clean on the scene
Without the drama my team making all the green
Im in your spleen no afro with mad sheen
In my ride young teen girls getting mean
Every Day just like Mary J
Im downtown Brooklyn where niggas play
The corners and blocks like street lamps I beat champs
In rapping leaving niggas wondering what happened
And that be the number one reason you cant flow
But bring back the other two shits to let em know
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker

Aight fuck that shit Word word
Fuck that other shit yknow what Im sayin
We gonna do a lil somethin like this
Yknow what Im sayin
Stay up on that shit 
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Knowm sayin Big Nas Grand Wizard God what is it
Its like HahaÂ you know what Im sayin
Yo go ahead and rip that shit dun
I rap for listeners blunt heads fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessyholders and oldschool niggas then I be dissin a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor fuck whos the liver
My man put the battery in my back a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My durations infinite moneywise or physiology
Poetry thats a part of me retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hiphop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco bluntsll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
Its real grew up a trife life the times of white lines the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac cold strap
With my peeps thats into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler I guess that means peace
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dicerollin match from craps to ceelo
With sidebets so roll a deuce nothin below
Peace God Peace God now the shit is explained
Im takin niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
Its like that yall
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Aliz niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine God
Check the prognosis Is it real or showbiz
My window faces shootouts drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses only the drama
For real a nickelplate is my fate my medicine is the ganja
Heres my basis my razor embraces many faces
Youre telephone blown black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro dramatic automatic 44 I let blow
And back down popo when Im vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brains blank
I see dark streets hustlin brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin for somethin somell prosper some fail
Judges hangin niggas uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics thats real
Word to Christ a disciple of streets trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say Peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat that niggas name made bell rings black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo son heard he was kingpin
Yo fuck rap is real Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge

A couple Os a few Xs
My current feels just like my exes

Ive got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs Wagner pies
And walked off to look for America
Kathy I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
Ive gone to look for America
Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said Be careful his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette I think theres one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
Kathy Im lost I said though I knew she was sleeping
Im empty and aching and I dont know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
Theyve all come to look for America
All come to look for America

6741,"The world fears a person with a dream
Because to have a dream gives you the ambition to wanna fulfill wanna that dream
And if you live your life fulling that dream youre gonna glow man Because theres a magnificence and a moment that comes with fulfilling you dream that you cant achieve being a part of someone elses
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love God I need you right now
You got famous fell off came back up damn thats insane
The same as you must be to be in this game
In this game you suffer hit strangers
Like Usain you bolt towards your dream
But haters speak disdain
Know my name and your name
But one things for sure man
Success is a sickness and there aint no cure man
Cure all is work hard and dont take no tours off
And even on off days you cant act like youre off
The payoff is tenfold in dollars and euros
Pitfalls of vanity pride and your ego
Just let go and live up to your full potential
What they say is hearsay its inconsequential
But naysayers say no but they are so simple
That they judge appearance and cant touch the mental
They are sheep they follow shepherds and man
Im Malcolm Im Martin I follow my plan
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love God I need you right now
Do it for family but they dont believe
That dreams that you have can even be achieved
Get ready young sailor heres rough on these seas
Cant let no doubt or selfpity drown me
Its design when you sign and the vultures appear
And if you should succeed then its worse by the year
But the worse curse is failure it kills by the day
Watch your dreams and ambitions as they fade away
See my curse is Ill verse in these verses I verse
Will still be overlooked like a body in hearse
But this Lazarus rap and this is my rebirth
This is no pen no paper just my dream on verse
The boot lady told me she dreamed I was cursed
Told her if you cant tell I returned to Earth
Returned to the dirt returned to the essence
Cause no weapon formed that gives me a succession
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes
All my dreams get knocked right back down
Two steps forward three steps back round
They keep pulling Im pushing Im shoving they showing no love God I need you right now
I hope youve learned about the business of chasing your dreams out there
I hope youre chasing your dreams till youre exhausted till your feet hurt till your bones ache and till you get it youre hoping that you wont let it go
I want this to be more than good music to you I hope its inspiration for you
Chad Butler told me a few years back fight for your dream Michael like a drowning man fightin for air
Follow your dreams no matter what people may say
They gon talk they gon front they gon hate
At the end of the day its between you and God cause you know what it takes

5318,"Made Nas Proud Lyrics
Freedom or jail clips inserted
A babys bein born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end as far as rap goes
Its only natural I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name
Yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus Nas wrote the Bible
Now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
I aint mad at you young king this unsung song is hauntin
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins my Old Earth grin sung a church hymn
She birthed in September took my first wind again the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz fled out lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas weak flow yo Cole lets murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas just bein nasty nigga
Military hat fatigue pants saggin Hennyd up
Execs askin will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor Arm and Hammer
But I had a appeal I was a charmer
Yet still bein my mamas son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosbys
But the street life robbed me of that so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help Older niggas was gettin mad
But thats the gift and the curse thats the good and the bad
At least you got Jay but he already one of the greats
And its hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign but they aint let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked thats when they point blame
So point blank young Cole you wont be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed I just wanted it to bring the warnin
Global warmin to that cold world you was breathin
Thats some advice I never got
If I dont sell another record Ill just steady rock
While you was writin down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say whats on ya mind you can stand the test of time
Now Im playin Born Sinner loud saw you live rock the crowd
Like wow you made your nigga Nas proud
So you aint let Nas down
Its just part of the game becoming a rap king my nigga
You aint let Nas down
How that sound Here the crown pass it to you like nothin nigga
You aint let Nas down
Long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin

Uhh
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Talk to em talk to em 
I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me
Im holding onto my last bit of decency
I need a vacay a change of scenery
But mama said wherever Ima go Im taking me with me
I told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me
She got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me
Its not the drugs that got me out of my zone
Going days without eating in a crowd I feel alone mama
Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night
I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
I speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me
She told me theres a higher power and a lower power
And that Ill die if I dont find the strength to overpower
Then I replied well arent we all
She said yeah but that should be on Gods terms not yours
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
Tryin to weather the storm
I thought that black cloud was gone
Its been beside me all along not the song
I wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute
Tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute
Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs worse
Cant be depression couldnt have it this long
So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron my nigga
Speaking of secrets thats when I got the Kaylin text
Read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next
She said youre going through a lot
Im hoping you aint in the grave and dead
Cause not too many people know your brains a mess
Who knew that she was keeping track of it all
I wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all
I aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap
Pen and pad in my hand and I was writing a note
Didnt get far as soon as I wrote down mom I just stopped
Couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her
Couldnt explain the why to her
Couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her
And shortly after that my pastor called
Which at first I kinda thought it was weird
But that convo preserved me bout Gods grace and mercy
He aint even say goodbye he said let us pray
And then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes
Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear
Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured
Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour
All my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack
If everybody calls you a duck will you just quack
Guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back
Cause when I had that burner ready to bust I didnt clap
Joe
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
Guess Im insanitys definition
Trying to step over in sanitys repetition
But I cant it got me tripping
Whatever love we had was dead that night
Looking back we both needed cooler heads that night
Was going off no sleep eyes red that night
While you was drunk texting me I hope I read that right
You was beefing bout Giselle beefing bout Alexa
Suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that I had sexed her
I was laughing thought it was funny
Giselles the homie Alexas twenty
With hip withdrawals
Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
I wouldnt dick her at all
Im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me
Was there for four months yet you said this was a new me
In your head guess the answer to this jealousy
Was to turn around and try to make me jealous B
But the part that you neglect
Was never mind jealousy this was bout respect
Yall Instagramming pictures trying to get me upset
You turned that into a night we both would never forget
We both said some things we both probably regret
You was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool
Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
Now Im fucking homeboy up just off the principle
I guess he caught him self antagonizing me
But hes a young nigga thats no surprising me
Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes
I left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho
I guess the part where I lose
Is now they got my face plastered all over the news Im being falsely accused
And I dont understand was this all part of a plan
I guess Ill tell the whole truth when on the stand
How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house
Now they got a search warrant just to come to my house
Question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid
And you know Jersey gun laws Im talking hollow tips
So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know whats going on
Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
Your face is fine this is a big waste of time
Lets get back to that jealousy
Now you got a nigga facing three felonies
All for what cause we were no longer dealing
You attack me but Im the villain over a fucking iPhone and feelings
Check you never see me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait
So now the whole world is watching me get burned here
Which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here
Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
Anytime theres a pole in the bar centered
So even though its from afar now
I still wish you the best I know your hearts tender
Im sorry all I just got my own scars to tend to
Signing off truly yours with love Gods sinner
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But he tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror

never forget We both said some things we both probably regret You was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you Now Im fucking homeboy up just off the principle I guess he caught him self antagonizing me But hes a young nigga thats no surprising me Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes I left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho I guess the part where I lose Is now they got my face plastered all over the news Im being falsely accused And I dont understand was this all part of a plan I guess Ill tell the whole truth when on the stand How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house Now they got a search warrant just to come to my house Question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid And you know Jersey gun laws Im talking hollow tips So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want But you and I know whats going on Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind Your face is fine this is a big waste of time Lets get back to that jealousy Now you got a nigga facing three felonies All for what cause we were no longer dealing You attack me but Im the villain over a fucking iPhone and feelings Check you never see me act like a jerk I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait So now the whole world is watching me get burned here Which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders Anytime theres a pole in the bar centered So even though its from afar now I still wish you the best I know your hearts tender Im sorry all I just got my own scars to tend to Signing off truly yours with love Gods sinner My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But he tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But he tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human,Mic check mic check One two one two New Joe Budden Uhh Please somebody help my soul Please somebody help my soul Please somebody help my soul Please somebody help my soul Talk to em talk to em I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me Im holding onto my last bit of decency I need a vacay a change of scenery But mama said wherever Ima go Im taking me with me I told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me She got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me Its not the drugs that got me out of my zone Going days without eating in a crowd I feel alone mama Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me I speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me She told me theres a higher power and a lower power And that Ill die if I dont find the strength to overpower Then I replied well arent we all She said yeah but that should be on Gods terms not yours My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But He tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human Tryin to weather the storm I thought that black cloud was gone Its been beside me all along not the song I wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute Tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs worse Cant be depression couldnt have it this long So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron my nigga Speaking of secrets thats when I got the Kaylin text Read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next She said youre going through a lot Im hoping you aint in the grave and dead Cause not too many people know your brains a mess Who knew that she was keeping track of it all I wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all I aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap Pen and pad in my hand and I was writing a note Didnt get far as soon as I wrote down mom I just stopped Couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her Couldnt explain the why to her Couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her And shortly after that my pastor called Which at first I kinda thought it was weird But that convo preserved me bout Gods grace and mercy He aint even say goodbye he said let us pray And then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour All my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack If everybody calls you a duck will you just quack Guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back Cause when I had that burner ready to bust I didnt clap Joe My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But He tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove

5233,"Wanted On the Run LyricsRunning Breathing
Wanted 100 miles and runnin
Through the rain and the sun when them fed folks comin
Keep your head up youngin gotta keep ya heads up youngin
The streetsll give your head up youngin
Listen clip your contacts stay focused like contacts
Your heads open for a contract
Cant go where mom at the last place you wanna bring the dram at
The first place they gonna track I promise
Cant relax but remain the calmest
Couple rules that your play by stay by stay live
You keep your boots on your laces tight
And only troop on the late night if you play right you stay right right
You never play the day light jakes get on your tail
Never let them see the break lights
Catch me if you can when Im dippin from the cops
Mr Gingerbread never falling victim of the fox
Chorus Wanted Dead or Alive 2x 
Wanted but you cant stop runnin
With a price on your head be prepared to gunnin
Dont be scared like the Red Coats comin nigga
Stay underground and keep runnin like Tubman
You cant sleep not a peep no slumber
Man I sleeped about a 100 hours rest this summer
No stress when your dealin with the run in
Waking up in cold sweats pissed scared of the rumblin
Fuck it just prepare for the trouble
Dont be shit scared nigga with your head undercovers
This not a broad threat I got something for em
On the steps with two tecs this is not a warnin
Nigga they close like camera flash
When the hammer blast put on your State Prop camouflage
Crack the box or the avalanche put on your Montana mask
Get to clappin like its Pakistan
What every strap cause an accident
Make a traffic jam dodge all the traps you can keep runnin
Chorus Wanted Dead or Alive 2x 
All you got to say is hide me I ride free
I be the one to change your birth SS or ID I got all that 
Aint no more hangin with the YG State Prop
No Roc private doc case you need an IV
No more Bent thats Accord money 420
Schemes cant afford money money yous award money
Whether 90 or the first degree any murder in the first degree
Well be the third degree and they looking for the perjury
If you aint murk the G perfectly youll be in surgery
Take the seed out the nursery nurse him at the precinct
Give em dessert that aint where he deserve to be
And I went through this personally certainly
32 for burglary now it was referred to me
So they play us in no way know way
Blaze up the roadways AC and OJ
Read the paper eggs and OJ
Call CD the head of the OJays
Thats a gipsy caps risky all the chips we had

You done pissed me off what is yall leaving for
Oh what A white girl with a flow aint been seen before
Bow down until your knees get sore
Treat Neimans like a grocery store
And Selfridges get the same rapport
Ask Bey when we off on tour
Hopping out a fly whip screaming This aint yours
How famous can one get fore she get tired
One phone call that make all the money get wired
Uh spit fire thatll burn down an empire
20 deep in the Sprinter tryin the Benz tires
Wave hello when I breeze by ya
Make enough in ten months I could live off or retire woo 
But I just wont quit
Tryna figure out which part of this you just dont get huh
Lord lemme know if you got this preaching about prophets
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Bow down to a Goddess bow down to a Goddess
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Goddess got it
Same critics wondered if I had it in me
Now want me to play friendly
But how the hell you play friendly when the mention of my name could cause a media frenzy
The cameras flash everywhere make it hard to miss me
Lately I been crazy tell a psych ward commit me
After any competition coming up against me
You think its anything better then come convince me
Until then Ill be leading the race
So bow down put your knee to your face
While I make wine outta water turn rappers into martyrs
Set it off whenever IGG in the place uh
Young rapper Goddess yall a boring read like Rappers Digest
I could never see you fall like I skip through August
Im thinkin bout now would be the time to start this
Lord lemme know if you got this preaching about prophets
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Bow down to a Goddess bow down to a Goddess
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess
Put your hands in the sky but only if you feel the vibe
They wanna bury me alive but yall aint know real gods never die
Put your hands in the sky but only if you feel the vibe
They wanna bury me alive but yall aint know real gods never die
Lord lemme know if you got this preaching about prophets
It aint no one man can stop us bow down to a Goddess

4506,"Theres big pieces of a life she cant remember
Her mind shuts down its trying to protect her
Might be for the best to forget but it seems like
They always reappear when she least expects
Late nights we lay awake drowning in the lake that pours out of her face
Years late but shes still not safe
Memories leap out ant time any place
The way he smelledthe way he smiled
The evil she even recognized as a child
Hand on her throat sting of a fist
Instead of her first kiss she got this
Shameful feeling painful secret
Lonely knowin that nobody would believe it
Every wound that escapes her time capsule
Hurts like the day it was born and its brand new
I wasnt there babygirl but Im here
I dont know what to say I just hear
If theres one wish I could make true
I would shoulder that pain and take it off you
Dont run babygirl dont run
You gotta face what you fighting head on
Only one thing I could say in truth
You gotta deal with the demons before they deal with you
How can she find peace in her mind when
Love means returning to the scene of a crime
I can feel it inside weve reopened wounds every time we intertwine
Such an evil design when you cant even enjoy the sweetness you find
Trying to see through the tears in your eyes and rebuild your shrine one piece at a time
E K made it all fade away
Colors dont burn no more its all gray
Cant find heaven from within that shell but its enough of a blessing if just not seen hell
Constant inner dialog says just end this roller coaster ride youre on
Only one solution seems final slide into a hole where your pain cant find you
She said if I was meant to die he wouldve killed me
There must be a reason that I still breathe
I dont have the tools to rebuild me
But I still believe that one day I could feel free
And my body can be mine again
My eyes can learn how to shine again
My inner child wont have to hide and then
When Im strong then love could be invited in
Sweet God thats all I ask of thee
Im willing to give what you demand of me
Im learning to embrace the reality
That life doesnt always turn out how its planned to be
I didnt deserve what was handed me
Only one who can grant happiness is me
What it takes for her to face the day
I can only hope to be half that brave

5976,"Yo I had to reinvent I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents man I been competin since
I look beyond what people sayin and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights cherish these people
Life is a movie but therell never be a sequel
And Im good with that as long as Im peaceful
As long as seven years from now Im takin my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days man do they go quick
Just yesterday I swear it was 06
Ten years ago thats when you proposed
I looked down Yes I suppose
All things go all things go
All things go all things go
I feel one minute yeah we got it then its gone
While we keep waitin for a moment to live for
So cant nobody ever tell me that Im wrong
Cause Ima ride out wit you still the night is young
And we keep goin we go We go we go 
We wake back up and do it all again And we know we know 
Said Fuck the world we ridin til the end
When all is said and done look what weve become Oh we go 
I just want you to know that I did it for you
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me but I didnt invite him
Why didnt he ask Or am I just buggin
Cause since I got fame they dont act the same
Even though they know that I love em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him he aint even call me
And thats the reflection of me
Yes I get it I get it was all me
Ill pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me
All things go all things go
All things go all things go
I feel one minute yeah we got it then its gone
While we keep waitin for a moment to live for
So cant nobody ever tell me that Im wrong
Cause Ima ride out wit you still the night is young
And we keep goin we go We go we go 
We wake back up and do it all again And we know we know 
Said Fuck the world we ridin til the end
When all is said and done look what weve become Oh we go 
I just want you to know that I did it for you
Lemme make this clear Im not difficult Im just bout my business
Im not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and thats a fact
Id give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why Im so overprotective
The more I work the more I feel like somehow theyre neglected
I want Caiah to go to college just to say We did it
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like Caiah is the both of them
Its like hes Caiahs little angel lookin over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and Ill always love him
And Im just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when Im around him
Gee we did it lets leave this imprint
Just finished writin this is The Pinkprint
All things go all things go
All things go all things go

Fuckin with them streets aint no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I dont never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets never on no sober shit
Posttraumatic stress I feel like thats what Im copin with
So I smoke the best impossible not to notice this
30000 feet up I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time aint even over yet
Im tryna live my life so when its over I got no regrets
The keys to success multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it til its over with
Napa Valley Dolce my cup runneth over with

5301,"On the mic at this time in the place to be
Im the Inhuman Orchestra called Biz Markie
That made you dance make the music with my mouth and all
But Im here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
Where I can be found if youre lookin
For me the Biz so just come check me out
Cause 247 Im mikin the house
So when I come in the Mall and then I start to roam
You wouldnt think its a store you would think its my home
Cause when I come in the place then I hang up a sign
Reads Home sweet home this house is mine
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I been to many malls from state to state
But Ive never been in say one this great I hate
To say about the other shopping centers thats left
But the Albee Square Mall is the doodoodef
I be in there everyday walkin around chillin
From when they opened all the way until when
Its about time for the place to close
Im just running things like a pair of panty hose
They all know me the Biz Markie
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in every store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
If I could move in party people I just might
So I could stay forever and it wont be just like
A bum that you see sleepin on a park bench
So how will it be when you see Biz Markie
I fade them all been havin fun
See to me this mall is like number one
And any other shoppers there that try to compare
There aint no way they could hang out with Albee Square
Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
I step in the place and shop around for a while
Buy some jewelry for Treny and Ali and after that Ill
Go take a stroll inside of Gibbs Pups
Then buy some fresh silks Ballys too
Next stop Olympic wanted to buy some sneakers
Then hit the Game Room to pick me up a Cesar
Stroll around with a fly female
While securitys riffin about leanin on the rail
After that I go eat some food at Wendys
In the Albee cafeteria could be shoppin plenty
From store to store just stuffin face
And I do the pfrronetwo while sayin my grace
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
Never use a quarter cause I got a calling card
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
Thats where I be until the day is done
Just coolin in the place thats number one
So next time youll be in Brooklyn walkin around
Play like Price Is Right and come on down
And
Go shoppin
Go shoppin
Go shop lets all go shoppin 3x 
Go shoppin
Go shoppin
Go shoppin Swan and Biz go shoppin
Lalalala
Lalalalalala till end

Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas

Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang go and make it bang
Gettin followed by them hollows go and make it bang
Niggas aint been to church in a minute
But its funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen
You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role its easy acting like Mitch
Paid In Full was more than reading a script
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water
Yeah while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh Im drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it Rodriguez
The illusion of money we dont believe in
You ask me Tyga looking like a genius
Im Kim Jong of the crack song
Gil ScottHeron to the black poem
Woo the revolution will be televised
Cause we done see all and they telling lies
Creep up on these niggas

Its only right for a queen to floss your shit
Rolex crowns I emboss your wrist
The minimums niggas aint synonyms
Dual exhausts driving flying saucers
Diamond crosses hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didnt know what the goal was
Shine remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse controlled by the iPad
Ahhh my living room rap scream crack money
I dont trust rap niggas or rap money
See this air hole tech and get ratttttt from me
Creep up on these niggas

Two years later admitting it all them niggas is renting shit
They ask why Im still talking dope why not
The biggest rappers in the game broke voil
They say its hate but its these welldressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh you aint know you got coached through it
Wooo the rap fans got hoaxed through it
Haaa the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Chess moves on your checkerboard king him

Uh this is O Dog in the courtyard
You wonder why Im still here

2488,"Its the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide at least half of a playing field
Because theres no explaining
What your imagination can make you see and feel
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Now its not a meaningless question
To ask if theyve been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any mans hand ever made that land
Then I think it wouldve showed
Thats why it seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
I know thats right
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
They say theres a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he dont need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know its a meaningless question to ask
If those stories are right
Because what matters most
Is the feeling you get when youre hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Yeaaaaahhhh thats when thats when they got you hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

The jury found that they were all not guilty not guilty 
Weve been told that all along Crenshaw Boulevard that theres a series of fires A lot of looting is going on A disaster area obviously
The jury found that they were all not guilty not guilty 
Make it rough
A lot of activity continues here at this command post 
Make it rough
We have sporadic fires throughout the city of Los Angeles 
Not guilty the filthy devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper cuss bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I cant trust a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born wicked Laurence Powell foul
Cut his fuckin throat and I smile
Go to Simi Valley and surely
Somebody knows the address of the jury
Pay a little visit Who is it Ohh its Ice Cube 
Can I talk to the grand wizard then boom
Make him eat the barrel modern day feral
Now hes zipped up like Leather Tuscadero
Pretty soon well catch Sergeant Koon
Shoot him in the face run up in him with a broom
stick prick devils aint shit
Introduce his ass to the AK40 dick
Two days niggas layed in the cut
To get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up
Wrong nigga to fuck with
Make it rough
Wrong nigga to fuck with
I got a Mac10 for Officer Wind
Damn his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
In a casket crew cut faggot
Now he aint nothing but food for the maggots
Lunch punch Hawaiian lying
Niggas aint buying ya story bore me
Tearing up shit with fire shooters looters
Now I got a laptop computer
I told you it would happen and you heard it read it
But all you can call me was antiSemitic
Regret it Nope said it Yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step
Niggas had to break you off something give Bush a push
But your National Guard aint hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me cause you know what
We woulda to this muthafucka up
Wrong nigga to fuck with
Make it rough
Wrong nigga to fuck with
Ayy Muggs make it rough
Wrong nigga to fuck with
Wrong nigga to fuck with
Its on Gone With the Wind
And I know white men cant dunk
Now Im stealing blunts and a cake from Betty Crocker
Orville Reddenbacher
Dont fuck with the blackowned stores
But hit the Foot Lockers
Steal motherfuck Fire Marshall Bill
Oh what the hell Throw the cocktail I smell smoke
Got the fuck out Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out didnt get stuck out
In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus Western Surplus got the heaters
Meet us so we can get the 9s and the whatnots
Got the Mossberg with the doubleeyed buckshot
Ready for Darryl and like Baretta would say
Keep your eye on the barrel a sparrow
Dont do the crime if you cant do the time
But Im rolling so thats a fuckedup slogan
The Hogans Heroes spotted the guerilla by the Sizzler
Hitting up police killer
The superduper nigga thatll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up so what the fuck
Wrong nigga to fuck with
Huh make it rough
Wrong nigga to fuck with

Aerial views of the ground
Freudian slumber empty of sound
Over the rooftops and houses
Lost as it tries to be seen

Stop me from dreaming
Dont be absurd
Well if we can help you we will
Youre looking tired and ill
As I count backwards
Your eyes become heavier still
Sleep wont you allow yourself fall
Nothing can hurt you at all

Youll have no trouble until
You catch your breath

6184,"I let you into my diary to admire me
The makeup of this man I let you see the higher me
The selfrighteous drug dealer dichotomy
Im drawing from both sides I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door entrada
Rip me apart and see whats inside of this piata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada thats one saga
One chapter of black magic Im Harold Potter
Feels like Im doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers wont allow us to bloom
And blossom I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adis I blow my own dice before I toss em
Lost some niggas some other niggas double crossed em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
Wrestled with the work we was like the four horsemen
Ric Flair with the flame Im motherfucking Gorgeous Woo 
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid crane kickno Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But they devil red tires double tread
I post and parks up that gets me double head
Tightrope walking tryna keep a level head
But bright lights blind look at what the devil did
She left the door open gave a fuck if Im famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the Alist
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
Im the only one left and the memories fading
So I write this alone in Vegas
Theyll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when youre rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
Its 911 youre on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista Im steppin out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupils now the teacher
The game cant grow by just followin the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede ya yuugh
Upgrade them upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it
She left the door open gave a fuck if Im famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the Alist
I write this alone in Vegas

8155,"Yo
We got broke niggas woke niggas who want smoke niggas
I fucked with Scott Storch so you know we got coke
Niggas fake with having Im lacing karats
Darlings in the states and Paris amazed the fabrics
I was rich when they wasnt still rich when you was
Men it is what it is Im a habitual plug
If I said it you say I was pathological
Got shot twice a night I checked myself out the hospital
I was pumping Keith Sweat had the gun in these sweats
Talks of killing his moms I couldnt live with regrets
Coco
Yooh yooh
So many bitches I swear Im a dickless
Now that the bags is different to talk different
Alright here we go
Yo here we go
Yo
So many bitches I swear Im a dickless
Now that the bags is bigger they talk different
She want the best life now so heres your wish miss
Weve been shitting or some about to do Christmas
Off white colored a truck to the hood love them toys
Aint no future and theres some good love and joy
Skin brown color on the joy
We mashed potatoes on the arms to avoid the noise
I told flex Im a thug man Im a die fly
Chanel forego 60 bands New Yorks flag
I chop the top off the Porshe when it we convert
My Cleopatra in Dubai try make me convert Im saying
Salam alaykom my uni country you know listen
Um
Trendsetters pristine boys niggas their ice
We woke up at the awards every rapper just like me
I inspire the bosses
Shit Ive been moving white like fire in crosses
No trump intended
Made me a menace thats work on the team playing when
Zach was on Memphis
When he win for the grounds real dont tell you how
Theres some other motherfucking clown will
And you could think spike for the motion pictures
A couple Jesus aint nice thats the frozen scriptures
Team rocking I mean Remi popping Drake popping
Pick and roll caught him M alone and Im Stockton
And you wonder why them niggas depress
We selling the same dope I just picture the best is coca
Uhhuh yeah
I done survive in the Bronx amongst killers and thieves
Hustled in the cold and below zero degrees
Id have seen shit that most probably wouldnt believe
So the second time on Flex fitting to be a breeze
Yo Flex respect to all these MCs stepping this far
The lyrical MCs please keep rapping them bars
The bar set they reach now Im resetting that bar
Promised yall by tomorrow Im gonna be mentioned with God
This is me catching the charge premeditated murder one
The cheese like my son the truth you never heard a son
Huh you heard Im fronting then somebody lied
You heard somebody did something to me somebody died
And if they didnt kill him bet somebody tried
So if hes still alive then God was on somebodys side
Somebody try to defined Myse no definition
One of the best cats thatspitting that get no recognition
I repping dudes sitting in prison when 90 something didnt numbers
And 90 summers to some of our closest friends from us
Dumb us we let these retreats not much
Jay Z tried tell us dont let this shit become us
What you see thats how they want us beef and fueling
Among us chasing the fame wearing the same chains that hung us
Then they lock us up for the same cane that brung us
We got to change the game but just maintain the hunger
The aim is getting younger theyre shooting at our babies now
Feminizing men dudes moving like ladies now
They said you sound like a hater sometimes I say
Nah I tell the truth is only hate when you lying
Theyve been waiting to find my kind
Divine being a shining McDonalds climax by just using my mind
Cuz nah I dont touch em see what they did to Russell
Some of these chicks done turning rape into hustle
Now have you really been assaulted and rape mind me I love you
I swear if I was there how to shot the coward for you
But listen Im trying to tell you that shit is a scam
They trying to divide the black women and men
So as the black man I stand right up here and I apologize
For that pain and neglect that left ya traumatize
You see when my father died I swear my mama tried
To turn me to a man I aint fell she is qualified
Thats why I went outside and I witnessed the homicides
And the drug dealers whoever was shooting we idolize
Thats why I despise when the rats got idolized
You played the game of snitch technical fault you disqualified
Nigga I defied them odds and I survived
Im 2Pac Shakur meets knowledge is modernized
They say that I provide a feeling thats undenied
Barring nobody I am the realest nigga alive
Your feelings then you died or you just dealing with pride
Yeah I know that I be spreading all bullshit and decides
For the minute that yall decide to celebrate authenticity
Every category you have its gonna mention me nigga
I gave him history facts bars consistently
How the hell they dont respect that its a mystery
So fuck yall listen they dont mean shit to me
Seeing my people revolve is my victory
Harry Belafonte well I call him Mr B
Said I had a gift God gave that gift to me
To lead the people from bondage and out of misery
Swami speak the truth to the Reaper come and visit me
You see my mission different thats why I see shit differently
Shit you might see a success I might disagree
Chick you might be paying for sex I might get for free
I think its lame to pay for sex but it might just be me
Maybe its just the grease levels and different leagues
Im war already thats why Im always in fatigue
Listen please dont get it confused because
Im elevating them switching my views and Im uplifting my dudes
I flip quick you get shit misconstrued
And I put a nigga in the clip on the news
So youre gonna choose which one you want me this preaching the unity
Or to me that be the reason your people reading your eulogy
I know its a contradiction understand its two of me
Its the goons Myse from the Bronx then its the new of me
Its the whole of me thats comfortable where the shooters be then the revolutionary newer version of Huey P
Flex can you agree that I did what I told you
I came up here and I shifted the culture they listening closer
They robbed me different they dont switch they approach up
That bullshit spitting is over now and they listened to Hova
444 tell me I aspire death Im flattered but I aint really buying that
But what I will say is that they wasnt jacking that kind of rap
Before I came up here stop me where Im lying at
Iron sharpens iron nigga I brought the fire back
I eat a tiger I brought lions that retired back
Real going admire that but the fake going down play
Swear these squares uncomfortable around me Why
Cuz I proudly point out they fraudulence
Then I expose these actors to their audience
Yall be ignorant that they dont move according to that shit that they recording and yall still applaud it me
Im reporting it live from the corners
When they do crime and get more time than Warner
You see Im trying to warn you its no more honor nah
They done trading these principles for designer
Your righthand man might kill you for some vagina
And the so called jeez get pistols to the minors
And this will yall be trying to compare to me
From where I swear this whole industry scared of me its clear
This shit its just like breathing enemies Im guard here
You should be making a prayer to me its rare
Youll see another rapper thats this complete
That speak like a scholar while honor like Pistol Pete
When his drama Im the piranha trying to get the meat pause
Im kind of like white collar mixed with street on my momma
Im just the lead Im not heart beat her the streets
I am the place where life and art seem to meet
See first I palm heat then I laid on Palm Beach
Now I got the world on my palm my song speak
And they stop looking they listen they pay attention
Because they be saying the same shit I just say it different
I just paint a picture of dimensions they cant mention
Cuz they aint bended it when they spit it it aint convincing
The image they predict aint the position
The image they predictable bars aint their position
Of course everybody gonna say they was in the kitchen
But what about the block getting locked facing that prison
When either you gonna tell what you wont sit in that cell
Everybody a G before that thats when its real
Now thats when you can tell the morals have finished still
When your back against the wall your character get revealed
So either you gon squeal and try to make you a deal
Or youre gonna pick 12 and you lose weight on the pill
I know that and going pill to a coward or civilian
With the Gs no I just kept with a million
Tell me how does it feel you sit witnessing greatness
The doubters is sick I know that haters gonna hate this
With the real rice been waiting for me to take this game
Back from the fake so please pardon my lateness but
I was busy fighting for freedom
These kids needed food for thought I had to feed them
They needed something to follow I had the lead em
Men of honour was becoming this thing I had to breed them
Chicks keep calling me God all in my DMs
No disrespect but God aint that your BM
Guess she realized your fraud
See a queen could tell the difference between a king
And the pawn when she see him
And yup I am here my motto is copper dim
Growing up in the Bronx and my heart darker than pm
And pool full of sharks I learned to swim
They hid their hands after they threw the rocks that I turned into gems
Nigga we turning men way before puberty shit
By age ten it wasnt nothing yall could do to me
America have ruined me Poverty real hunger
Oppression pain same shit that may kill Manga
And they still wonder what Im marching for
To identify allies when its time for war
Which Ill gonna do when they declare martial law
And then the soldier with guns knocking at your door huh
You aint even prepared
The revolution done starting you aint even aware
You see the Dred Scott case takes
We cant be free and these United States cause we aint even from here
Long as Im breathing this air until its even and fair
Ima fight cuz one thing I dont believe in its fear
I guess the reason Im here is to maintain the balance nigga
Im the place between peace and balance
Between screaming and silence ignorance acknowledge nigga
Just fighting off these demons is a challenge
It is the talent just keepin my composure
While you beef with me knowing I could fold you
Knowing if I told my soldier he would mow you
Down like a lawn you see is pros vs cons
Is knowing that Im in the right but its still wrong
Its chess why sacrifice the knight for a pawn
Yo flex Im gone before I leave your residence
I hope you realize this is black excellence
This is black brilliance black power resilience
The Black Panther not to film the real shit
This black Wall Street time to rebuild this
We need a thousand Oprahs and a thousand Will Smiths
We need celebrities of a higher pedigree
To have some integrity that one to leave a legacy
Shit Im fighting for Im probably aint gonna never see
But my kids will just hope today remember me
Hope today remember he defied the odds
He played the hand he was dealt never shuffle the cards
A1 since day one he never fuck with no frauds
He frontlined and never get you nothing but bars
Nothing but the uncut raw shit they make your nose bleed
The Bible verses the shit that niggas souls need
The OG told me it was designed to divide us brother
Cuz even in Wakanda we is fighting each other
So just imagine if we was all fighting together
We all be winning and all of our lives would be better
Good people died just so I can have a life
And thats why I give my life as a sacrifice
Good people died just so I can have a life
And thats why I gave my life as a sacrifice

6154,"Im gon ride Im gon ride
They gon ride we all gon ride
Ive come from the heart of South Side
Holdin it down for my niggas that died
I gotta busy bird on my side
Pop shit and get your whole mouth wired
Baby had tried to steal off the payroll
Ill have niggas scrappin the skin off yo face
With the same shit they peel the potatoes
I thank the Lord for my blessings and Im glad he gave us
The willpower and reflexes of Larry Davis
You dont wanna see my block formin
Thats a hundred and one doggs
And I dont mean the ones with the spots on em
Were respected highly
Cause you dont need to practice gymnastics to catch a body
Me and moneys like Whitney next to Bobby
If I bring all my niggas Ill need an extra lobby
As soon as you aint around jake
You get your ass whipped for chips
Now thats the real definition of poundcake
I got the crown snake and you can tell when Im shopping
Cause when the mall stampedin you feel the ground shake
I got a car I only drive on Thursdays
Im a stunna Banks blows more cake than birthdays
Look at here aint nobody round here scared
Im headin for the top and Im almost there
Oh yeeuh this shiny shit right here
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear
You know how I gets down this pound holds six rounds
I told ya Id be back bitch talk that shit now
You hear that fofif sound duck when I spit rounds
Cause this aint Beverly Hills you in the bricks now
We aint got shit down here but dope and guns for sale
You get your head cracked and niggas dont run and tell
Its like we sell crack get caught head back to jail
We on that fuck the police shit we livin in hell
You better guard your grill homey and stand your ground
These bullets burn they hit whoevers standin around
I never learn even after I took a couple shots
I just got me some BandAids and bought a couple Glocks
Had to go on a rampage and hit a couple blocks
Once they hear that 12gauge thats when the trouble stops
If its beef then Im ready to ride
Just come to Cashville you can find me on the South Side
Motherfucker
Look at here aint nobody round here scared
Im headin for the top and Im almost there
Oh yeeuh this shiny shit right here
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear
Now I aint from Michigan but Im in the Fab Five
You know Yayo and 50 Buck and Game you know my fuckin name
Whether the truck or train my minds stuck on the grind
Cause somewhere down the line a lot of suckers came
Yeah aint talkin shit but we can all tell he ass
Jabs will black his eyes like the R Kelly mask
You gotta blast me yo cause the Louisville
Will have yo head lookin like the top of a pistachio
The young gunner with a raspy flow
Got every boyfriend thinkin their girlfriends a nasty ho
My heart laughin its small
Maybe its cause my grandpop dropped right after the ball
Banks hops out bulletproof this bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel when you hot they hawk you
I got the hood on my shoulder
Chain big as a boulder
The 357 tucker
Motherfucker
Look at here aint nobody round here scared
Im headin for the top and Im almost there
Oh yeeuh this shiny shit right here
Ill work magic and make you niggas disappear
Yeeuh haha

5506,"And natures game once more begins
Here we go like yes yes yall
To the beat yall
Aint no sleep yall
To the break of dawn
Five oclock in the morning
We keep rockin on
The workin people runnin like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin in the meat market
Chicks take a seat park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like its heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get er done
That ole hit n run
Turn em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Aint nothin like wakin up with a stranger in your bed nope
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today
Its all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but cant take away the frown
Found under the makeup
I asked her whats your passion
Answered whats the paper
She sleepin and they dont want her to wake up
Maybe then shell realize her own beauty
Baby you a star and not just a star on some dudes home movies
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Steppin out I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
Im slippin in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree now we hang behind the rope we VIP
We do it BIG
Aint no need to see ID
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off dont need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the skys fallin
Like you Chicken Little come on
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one

Where theres love overflowing
I wish I was home I wish I was back there
With the things I been knowing
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin the scene makes it all clean
Maybe theres a chance for me to go back there
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where theres love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend let me start again
Suddenly my world has changed its face
But I still know where Im going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet Ive watched it growing
If youre listening God
Please dont make it hard to know
For us to believe in the things that we see
Tell us should we run away
Or should we try and stay
Or would it be better just to let things be
Living here in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So its real real to me
And Ive learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find a world full of love
Like yours like mine like home

Been livin the life crazy ice
Hit the baddest chicks in the world maybe twice
The swag the gear the bread
All the whips is a year ahead I only fear the feds
Forty five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank call it a free throw
Funny cause I had the Vision since Coleco

Whether Im on 5th or LA at the swap meet
Its all good cause I know the gangstas got me
First things first the jars are broccoli
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one niggas cant guard me properly
And when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milograms of oxy

6749,"You ever have a cold in the summer
That shit be the worse
It gets better though
Howâtheyâturn a topâdog to an underdog
Its a coldâworld even in the summer dawg
Like a hunnid missed calls in my number log
I talk to God fore I talk to people from them blogs
Gotta see through it when its thick as London fog
Im from the city baby I done grew up under Small
Not to bring up old shit Im not a plunger dawg
No dalmatian but I come through with a hunnid dawg
And they dont bark they bite
Let it spark they might
Gotta walk straight right
Turn the dark to daylight
Let em talk they right
In your heart stay light
Play your part stay tight
Bosses park where they like
Dont you let them trick you out your spot and put that guy on
Rather cut em off and let a bygone be a bygone
When you ballin you that nigga that they got they eye on
So I think I know just how it feel to be a Zion
Bussin out sneakers swingin on rims
Being number 1 bringing on Ms
Hope the Knicks get him Ima bring him Timbs
Tell em lace his boots Ima give a king some gems
Like look you the great hope and a scapegoat
You gon have to make quotes and take notes
And some cant take smoke so they may choke
But those who learn to make boats stay afloat
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer

No feelings for the whole summer
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
The media promoting fake they just stampin and shit
You dont wanna see us beef then stop ampin and shit
They was giving Meek an L said he wouldnt prevail
Next thing you know that boy was in a championship
So everyday Im goin in Im on some vampire shit
And every night Im in my bag like Im campin and shit
The trenches that we grew up in need to know you can win
So you see me in my hood on my champion shit
See a minor setback breed a major get back
If I lose it aint over I be yelling bet back
I come from where they take it you might never get back
Gotta shoutout New Jersey yall wont get the Nets back
Play for keeps round here Pradas deep round here
Shooters creep round here hard to sleep round here
Life cheap round here Grim Reap round here
Spilled milk get wiped up we dont weep round here
We just goin harder we raisin sons and growin daughters
Came a long way and workin on going farther
Grew up not knowing fathers seeing no one bother
But know my story gets better cause I know the author
Keep readin its a comeback story
I told her that if you leave dont ever come back shawty
I be sayin word to Mother she the one that taught me
Karma is a bitch who hoes around and come back for me
Cold
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Devil tryna take ya soul from ya
Callin but he got my old number
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer

Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
Ohohohoh its gon be a cold summer
Im chillin for the whole summer
No feelings for the whole summer
I just feel like life is hot and cold
Ups and downs back and forth
Wins and losses
Its gon be some sunshine and its gon some rain
And when it rain it pours
But ask yourself can you weather the storm until the sun shines again

7245,"Yeah
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all aall aall aall
Wasnt ready to be no millionaire I was illprepared
I was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
From the beginning it wasnt bout the ends it was bout
Bustin raps and standin for somethin fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin act like youre happy Im fuckin back again
With another anthem why stop when it doesnt have to end
It aint over til I say its over enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up Im afraid of Whatll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit I salivate at it wait is up
Hands up like its 12 noon nah homie hold them bitches straighter up
Wave em til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos I aint deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt cause
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all aall aall aall
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
Im so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I dont got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can man will I survive in this climate or what
They said I was washedup and got a bloodbath
Im not a rapper Im an adapter I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floors open if youd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muhfucka and if I dont make the cut
What Like I give a fuck Ima light this bitch up like Im driving a truck
Through the side of a pump zero to sixty hop in and gun it
Like GUnit without the hyphen Im hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut
And I look like I might just give up eh mightve mistook

Refuse to quit fuse is lit cant defuse the wick

As soon as I get thrown in a booth I spit
But my respect is overdue Im showin you the flow no one do
Cause I dont own no diploma for school I quit

So you better trade your fuckin mics in for some toolboxes
Cause youll never take my pride from me itll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me I dont want you to buhlieve
Cause this is somethin that I must use to succeed
And if you dont like me then fuck you Selfesteem

Man nobody gave me shit I wait my motherfuckin turn Turn 
Therapy for my soul
I had a few hits even had a few misses
Got clumsy in the kitchen even broke a few dishes
Street life scarred me my soul need therapy Therapy 
Therapy for my soul
I aint never been the one to complain thats win or lose
Made moves and paid dues walk in my shoes
Its like a nigga came with directions I really made me
I was drownin then I threw me a float I really saved me
Put down everything that I love thats on my legacy
Never fucked over nobody to make a better me
If you ask me what happened with Kink we grew apart
Tried to sue he took me to court shit broke my heart
Same nigga you made a millionaire sue you for millions
Made man and he want it all none for my children
If 15 wasnt my dawg I wouldve touched them
When that shit went down with Gibbs I couldnt trust him
Invested my hard earned money tied up my bread
But he gon try to tell you Im flawed thats in his head
Its happening just the way that I said it good on your own
And if Im honest nothin gangsta about you leave this alone yeah
And everybody wonderin what happened with me and Coach
Same shit that happened between Tommy and Ghost
Cause yeah the checks comin in but the trust aint there
I would say its all him but that wouldnt be fair
I was fresh up out the streets tryna fight my own demons
Knew somethin wasnt right guess I had my own reasons
Mission impossible I aint underplan that
Shake took his own life I aint understand that
Had me feelin numb laid in bed for a week
Eyes didnt close one time thats a week with no sleep
Ima keep it solid he the reason me and Ross talk
Never ashamed to admit that I was wrong yeah thats boss talk
Since we talkin boss talk lets address the sucka shit
Grown man playin on Instagram real sucka shit
Why the fuck this clown nigga playin with my legacy
Solid in these streets thats some shit that you will never be
Talking bout power but weak niggas do the most
In real life nigga you really borrow money from Ghost
All that lil boy shit yeah it make it evident
Made millions in these streets what the fuck is 50 Cent
And its still free Meech love him if he right or wrong
But the streets wanna know do we really get along
If you askin me nigga thats one thousand percent
If I did somethin wrong then I gotta repent
Aint no hatred in my heart aint no hatred in my veins
If you felt me being distant think its time to explain
I was stickin to my plan while Raf Simons took the stand
He tried to GMoney me whats happenin with your man
Tried to throw me in your case guess he tryna save face
No exception know the rules I just handled it with grace
And I aint sayin that you told him to do it I know better
Still the same nigga nothin but love thats forever
See my ego and my pride yeah I put it all aside
Reminiscing bout all them late nights we used to vibe
When its all said and done were brothers your mother love us
The Feds did you dirty cant stand them motherfuckers
Speaking bout brothers welcome home Tee
A nigga might owe you money but that nigga aint me
I be lookin for the truth cause that shit be hard to find
All these lies and these rumors fuckin with my peace of mind
Been listenin to my thoughts and lately Ive been concerned
Feel like my soul on fire let that motherfucker burn
Man nobody gave me shit I wait my motherfuckin turn Turn

But she a Gemini so stay on her friendly side
Shell put that look on you its like somebody friend just died
My pretty Black princess smell sweet like that incense
That you buy at the bookstore supporting Black business
Teach her what black is the fact is her parents are thorough
She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough
I keep her hair braided bought her a black Barbie
I keep her mind free she aint no black zombie

Manenberg Gugulethu where youd just be blessed to get through
For beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Coloured for realizing were African
For all my cousins back home the strength of Mommys backbone
The length of which she went for raising sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elnas back I march
Fist raised caramel shining in all our glory
For Mauritius St Helena my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Eadie for Norma Leslie Ndidi
For Auntie Betty for Melanie all the same family
Fiona Jo Burg complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
This worlds yours and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls raise up your hands the world should clap for us

6992,"Only Slaves DREAM Lyrics
Do you think that the powers that be
Are goin to let you do what you want to do for eternity
Of course you dont so what do you fear
Why you spazzin out why you so scared
Everybody wanna be first
Nobody wants to be last
Do you think a God that created this would watch all of us die while others just laugh
What happens when the money system crash
And theres no more value in the cash
You gon suck dick and sell ass
You gon try to fight back with ya hands
You probably change your money into gold
You gon use that to try and buy soul
Buy some drugs with it buy a piece of hole
Dont tell me I dont wanna know
You need to come up with a better plan
The Devil smash metal weapons like glass
Right now we outmatched and outclassed
We have to stay on a spiritual path
Cause in the absence of love we blastin one another with blood
Media shows up to capture the buzz
Im a child of God not a rapper from the gutter
Im six of one and half a dozen of the other
This is not one of those I told you so moments
This is just Canibus being open
Lower egoic minds brush aside
But cant nullify the high science that is coming from the rhymes
I couldnt believe it the day that I was told
That every person alive does not have a soul
And is not in control of these cotton pickin polls
Politicians declare the war of attrition on the globe
And stole all the fishin holes Grandma got the chitlins on the stove
Thatll overload the senses in your nose
Young folk cant even afford to get old
How many YouTube views before you go gold
How many albums last week you sold How many leaked downloads
Oh you still believe the Soundscan bro
Dont be discouraged write and produce and record and you love it
This is your art and thats the point of it
When you get paid from it things change people behave stubborn
And say rude things to judge it
They want you to thug it so they can have you like a test subject
Handcuffed and take mug shots of it
I told you before Im nobodys spit puppet
I say what I want you take what you want from it
This is a social experiment put on by the public
Hiphop is completely corrupted
You aint rappin bout that you aint rappin bout nothin
I aint never gon starve I been white tail huntin
Yall motherfuckers is buggin speakin with no substance
Hiphops the way it is because of you cousin
It aint my fault you locked me out of it
99 percent of my fans aint nothin
But scumbag scum buckets blood suckin cock fuckers
My lyrics too advanced for the average block hustler
You know my name Im deeply inspired
On a mountain lion meat diet eat and be quiet
Recycle the fire and deep fry it
That line is hot but you said it before you get a C minus
My shit is timeless like the Great Wall of China
Sick in the biggest way like a dinosaur virus
Spreadin through Verizon Wireless
Homeland Securitys tryin it just to see if you lyin Bis
They step to me never thought it would happen like this
You a flight risk we need that microphone back Bis
Diversionary tactics Magik madness
Canibus you cant leave this miserable prison planet God damnit
We dont care what your fans think
Cause 99 percent of all of this dont exist
The observer changes the properties of the observed
This is done with your mind not with your words
Word Yeah Im about to show you nerds
You bookworms really startin to get on my nerves
I cant talk like you but I can understand you
I know what this entire ordeal can expand to
I love hiphop Ive always been a fan too
Im a big fan of everything you do
I appreciate the purchases the online searches
I hope you enjoy the verses it was great to be of service
This was always my purpose
Im always workin to be a better person everyday
And still growin like the Earth is
Peace to the Gods and the Earths kid

Is it a matter of opinion
Or just a contradiction
But from where I come from
All the blondes have more fun
Well just awatch them sisters on a Saturday night
Peroxide causin all the fights
I took a rose in Texas
She gimme plenty of practice
But I couldnt touch the surface
Cause of recent facelift
She had no idea what loves about
Cept the one oclock call on the casting couch
Sissy from New York
Was on the cover of New Vogue
I aint supposed to be available
So completely untouchable
I got a limousine n bodyguard and chaperone
But God knows Rodder just needs to ball
You can keep your black and your redheads
You can keep your brunettes too
I wanna girl thats semi intelligent
Gimme a blonde thats six feet two boy
And that aint all
I had a crush on Bardot
Fell in love with Monroe
Read about em in the nationals
All the juicy little scandals
But I never saw em dancin at the county hall
With the short fat guys prematurely bald
Dig this
You can keep your black and your redheads
You can keep your brunettes too
Dont wanna subservient woman
Gimme a blonde thats six feet two boy
And that aint all

There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song no heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me

And to think that you are mine you are mine alone
There is no greater love

2602,"Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
A love has got ame down
A tear just hit athe ground
So I started writing you this song
But the words I wrote came out all wrong
Yeah but its all right
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
When you cant define athe crime
Athen life aint worth a dime
When they take away everything you got
And they rub your nose in the funky spot
Not without a fight
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
When you work your fingers to the bone
Now what does that get you nothing
In a crowd of people
Youre still alone
You hope that tells you something
The road to heaven is paved in hell
And it makes you wonder
Why were here at all
Check out the shape of your circumstance
He wears the dress and she wears the pants
Here comes Jill and she needs romance
But you cant do jack so shut up and dance
Sex is like a gun
You aim you shoot you run
When youre splittin hairs with Mr Clean
Its like gettin head from a guillotine
And the night has just begun
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance

3657,"I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just cant keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
Laa lalalalalaa
Lalalalalaa
Lalalalalaa
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But theyll never kill the thrills weve got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last
Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just cant keep still

When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
It was all good just a week ago
Shoe box full no sneakers though
Just moved in its been a week or so
Brand new coupe so the seat could go
White Benz White Benz light tint Light tint 
Riding like What the fuck is an indictment
Spent ten thous for excitement
Thats how the day goes thats how the nights went
Louis bags Balenciagas
The ones talked about by the fashion bloggers
You know me Im a Murcielaga
In the same lime green as the Air Max joggers
But if it wasnt here will she wanna go
You dont wanna ask but you wanna know
Will my baby weather the storm
Stick around til the weather is warm
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
She like shopping but never trendy
A little Gucci maybe Fendi
Island hopping the West Indies
Diddy said got us all about the Benjis
Key tile phelipe chow
Reservations we could sleep now
Ask how much I dont allow such
Pull an AMEX out ya reptile clutch
But who knew that the sky get cloudy
I bought her four rings didnt think shed be outty
Huh the games over seize my Range Rover
Feds said somebody gave my name over
Now Im inside shes outside
What should you do How about ride
Guess nothing lasts forever
I thought we could watch these clouds pass together
But hey
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
You cant ride big on lil rims
You wanna do it big You need a Lil Kim
Raise ya hand high look in the man eye
I dont know em your honor cant lie
Money comes money goes
So you need to blow it like a runny nose
On a lady who aint turn 180
Place no one above ya sweet sady
Sun stop shining she never got shady
She couldve watched them box you in like a Brady
But she stood up like what up
Its a cold world zip the coat put the hood up
Thats some sick shit thats a ill bitch
When you dead broke she make you feel rich
See mama youre my Rihanna
Pull the umbrella when you see drama
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh
When the money goes will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey uh

Mojique thinks of days before Americans came
He serves the foreigners in growing numbers
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
He dreams of days that he can still remember now
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
Mojique sends the package to the American man
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
He feels the time is surely now or never more

He calls the wind to guide him on his mission

Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a goddamn minute
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait one fucking minute
Im looking at your year end list
Youre choosing rappers youre friends with
Who be rapping what their friends did
Toolie ratchets and extensions
Wait wait wait a minute
We done already heard their best shit
We already got the message
They on a lean molly Percocet trip
Think I found what real success is
Running around here since The Message
Forty pounder full of death wish
Money counter full of blessings
I sent a cannonball right out the cannon barrel
Through your wall closet through your damn apparel
Through your grandma chair through your granite countertop
And I aint tryna stop it til you standing on the doorstep
Of the man upstairs nigga youre next
Wait a minute nigga
Ive been going crazy on these records way before Flex
This the bad half Shady vortex armed in navy warfare
Yall them Barnum Bailey boys
Best to back the fuck up or get smacked the fuck up eighty million different ways
If I say its fuck the world then the worlds getting fucked
Eighty million different ways when Im finished with it
Then the worlds gon get the AIDS like some 1984 sex
This the traumatize your favorite rapper year
This the homicide related racketeer
All Im tryna hear today is trap and drill
Its all downhill from here like Jack and Jill wait
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
Im giving all my hoes an ultimatum she my mascot
Im just tryna motivate her Im just popping
Shes just getting ass shot like a Soulja Boy home invader
I get a whole clip to all my haters
Just so I could go and get exonerated
Wait wait wait a minute
Wait a motherfucking minute
I watch you niggas go tool up
Im Compton menace on school bus
Its documented boy prove what
Been dropping gems since I grew up
I got to fill this void move bruh
The targets been destroyed boo ya
These nerds rapping for attention
For a word from Vlad or Akademik
Prefer to slap you over engine
Im Murs rapping for the Guinness
Wait wait wait a minute
I know you heard Im back in business
Im going harder than Tha Carter X
Im birds flapping independent
Im tycooning through the pressure
Im typhooning through this weather
I might do a nigga beat for em
Give it back to him a little PHresher
Got the cash holding on line two Brinks truck noise on one
Casanova with the rifle fuckboy dont run
Im live from it with the streams
Buying guns and getting beams
You guys coming with your teams
Its feeling like iFunny with the memes
I flip the blade like say something
Around dough like Rajon
Let you rip the stage then I come and rip the stage
Down more like Trey Songz
Category slaughter gang shit
Feel me nigga this is God hustle
Phantom or the Vette
Tomi Lahren Charlamagne shit the odd couple
Wait wait wait a minute
Im primal if Im fuckin mating with her
I bend her over stick her on the expensive car
Tyler fucking Creator with it
You a lame you from Twitter fame
You had a chain thats your nigga chain
Face down on your computer key sleep
Closest you gon be to laying in your name
Body bag after body bag
Leave a trail laying in your lane
Im Cold Chillin on the record business
But I aint saying I distribute Kane
Wait a motherfucking minute
You popping molly with the actors
I fucked the baddest of the white bitches
Im Talib Kweli with the blackness
Im most def with immigration
Ladies on top of ladies
Im Mos Def with immigration
Babies on top of babies
Wait a motherfucking minute

Now heres what I want yall to do for me 
Back caught you lookin for the same thing
Its a new thing check out this I bring
Uh oh the roll below the level cause Im livin low
Next to the bass Cmon turn up the radio
They claiming Im a criminal
But now I wonder how some people never know
The enemy could be their friend guardian
Im not a hooligan I rock the party and
Clear all the madness Im not a racist
Preach to teach to all Cause some they never had this 
Number one not born to run about the gun
I wasnt licensed to have one
The minute they see me fear me
Im the epitome of public enemy
Used abused without clues
I refuse to blow a fuse
They even had it on the news
Dont believe the hype

Yes was the start of my last jam
So here it is again another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics you can hang em Ill hold the rope
But they hope to the Pope and pray it aint dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Dont tell me that you understand until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane insane
Yes to them but to me Im a different kind
Were brothers of the same mind unblind
Caught in the middle and not surrendering
I dont rhyme for the sake of riddling
Some claim that Im a smuggler
Some say I never heard of ya a rap burglar
False media we dont need it do we
Its fake thats what it be to ya dig me

All the jealous punks cant stop the dunk
Coming from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate they drink Clorox
Attack the Black because I know they lack exact
The cold facts and still they try to Xerox
The leader of the new school uncool
Never played the fool just made the rules
Remember theres a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a time bomb
In the daytime radios scared of me
Cause Im mad plus Im the enemy
They cant come on and play me in prime time
Cause I know the time cause Im getting mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know Im living right so here go the micsike
Before I let it go dont rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to Herb yo if you cant swing this
Learn the words you might sing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it defy it I swing Bolos
And then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that some media is the wack
As you believe its true
It blows me through the roof
Suckers liars get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
From them I say dont believe the hype
Yo Chuck they must be on the pipe right 
Their pens and pads Ill snatch cause Ive had it
Im not a addict fiending for static
Ill see their tape recorder and I grab it
No you cant have it back silly rabbit 
Im going to my media assassin

Yo Griff get the green black and red and
Gold down countdown to Armageddon

Put the left in effect and I still will
Rock the hard jams treat it like a seminar
Reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard
Some say Im negative but theyre not positive
But what I got to give The media says this 
Red black and green you know what I mean
Yo dont believe that hype
They got to be beaming that pipe you know what Im saying
Yo them Megas got em going up to see Captain Kirk
Like a jerk and they outta work
Let me tell you a little something man
A lot of people on daytime radio scared of us
Because they too ignorant to understand the lyrics of the
Truth that we pumping into them cloggedup brain cells
That just spun their little wooden skulls they call caps
You know what Im saying

Dont worry Flavor vision aint blurry you know what Im saying

But the bars that I spit through God exist
Who we be thats who we are
Versace Gucci Louis Vuitton
My taste expensive as a superstar
So I take what I want like a coup dtat
From profit sharing to profiteering
Now they stop and stare cause we cop McLarens
But we not preparing for Gods appearance
Too busy dominating and domineering
Our competition securin our position
Now our greed dangerous as a heart condition
Rap niggas lie like politicians
So I gotta tell the truth thats a smart decision
Capitalism is a cataclysm
If white collar crime is a bad decision
Then the makers who routinely crash the system
Would quickly get they asses dragged to prison
Need money to eat need money to live
Need money to keep need money to give
But when pursuit of the money is your only goal
Then you lose control then you lose your soul
Dollars and cents to rob our children of their innocence
So when its sent we come to our nations capital to cash the check
According to Dr King when he saw it clear in his dream
We built the pyramids they built a pyramid scheme

Try to tax mines and youll be on the news tomorrow
Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out with suicidal thoughts
All my life Ive been a lady bruiser a wrong chooser
School refuser drug abuser born loser
Clothes bummy nose runny it wasnt funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
Imma hit the mainstream with ill raps thats poison like gangrene

Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
Im not a coward and fronting on me I wont allow it

You full of shit you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eatin all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin bitch I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty half full Ill spill ya
Try me and run into a wall outfielder
You know Ima ball til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor I enjoy em while they still ripe
Bitch stop playin I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals then Ima have a mink soon
Tell em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth but I guess thats a foreign language to yall

But most of yall dont get the picture less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin you dont know the half of it
Young Money Cash Money
Paper chasin tell that paper Look Im right behind ya
Bitch real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say Im borderline crazy sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams I dont sleep so I cant find her
You niggas are gelatin peanuts to an elephant

Yeah with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin well now wish me well
Tell em kiss my ass call it kiss and tell
Word to my mama Im out of my lima bean
Dont wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits bitch Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas thats tryna front and see
Son of Gun Son of Sam you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech I glow like Buddha
Disturb me and youll be all over the flo like Luda
Bitch I flow like scuba bitch Im bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho she gon blow right through ya
I be mackin bout my stackin now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold bitch but our actions is cooler
Wayne these niggas out they mind

That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these I fuck these on your mind pause
To feed them on my grind did I get a little love

If you gettin money just throw it in the bag
Well alright
Loso and Drizzy baby
Uh uh we up in Barneys goin dumb again
Every time we leave the manager say come again
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back I make her feel young again
If her card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They dont give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him tell me thats her baby
I hope that I never meet him that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah she say she lucky that she his

If they ask how much tell em what its lookin like
Everything I buy fly its like Im bookin flights

Took my pistol out unlocked it
Pulled the hammer back and cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet

Dropped in the middle of the floor and he aint breathin

Watch my hands

I just want to jam for you Ev Everybody get up 
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you Get on up Get on up 
Get down get down On down 
Like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I get on up
Rhythm and funk makes you hump like Technotronic Ill make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
Danananadada without eating my damn spinach
Cause when Im on a roll thats when Redman start to chill
Round off backflip cartwheel
Ahh youre nasty I know
When my afro grow that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue on the menu and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
Its like this its like that I wont slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throw down and strut
Yo E whats that funk mode Get on up
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you Ev Everybody get up 
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you Get on up Get on up 
Check this out here let the rough cutcut your ear
Hit Squads the crew Im twentytwo and Becks the beer
Float like Muhammad rollon like Secret
Me rip the crowd in half on the sneak tip
Til they crumble too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a babee while the others bumbumble
Dondandan dododonding
Extremely wild like the hair on Don King
Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
Its the huh the funk now Im known around the globe
So buckle up hush up while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound grab my bozack then I freeze now Freeze now 
On your mark get ready get set lets go
With the flow to jet like Delta or Jesse O
Wens with the Benz I clean my front lens
With a system that knocks harder than RinTinTin
Without question Im flexy when Im sexin
Wicked when I kick it like A Tribe Called Quest and
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed since pops dropped the seed
I knew Id be the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged more nuggets in the bucket
Thats dumb dumb dollars and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E whats that funk mode Get on up
I just want to jam for you
I just want to jam for you Ev Everybody get up

Then they go with the flow thats ferocious
Kill em off with the minimal dosage
You dont wanna see the result of my ultimatum when I focus
And I got the streets on lock
Muthafuckas feast on Twist like they feast on Pac
Im a beast and the beats dont stop
Twista and the Legendary Traxster and we so hot
Kill em off if we ever get into it in a minute Imma murder em and put em in a bodybag aint nothing they can do about it
Dump em in the streets youll never know it was Get Money that was in the controversy cause I off whoever knew about it
Take it up another level when Im off of tropical and raise it up another decimal in my mentality
Physically I be from the inner city of the Windy City but Im spiritually from another galaxy
And I be one of them niggas that never do give a fuck
What you say as long as Imma get em up
Witness that Im fly look at the way I kick back
Quickest in the Chi guess you can say I spit that

Take over the game no cheat code
And Imma ball like Shaq no free throws Im on
When it be coming to this rap shit Im top shotta
Midwest godfather honored in the city like Bambaataa
And Im a damn problem a speedknot mobsta
Blowing on the top ganja
Everything I wear cost top dollar

If youre bout getting money come fuck with me
If you blowing on loud come fuck with me
If you need a new style come fuck with me

Mass of the rap lance rigs with photons
Come on write that over more gigs and role bombs
Make you have to hold your kids in your arms
Got you the remedy
We stand the test of time like Im the statue of liberty
And Im bringing the wrath on my enemy and Im an immortal
When Im in a portal full of math and chemistry
Telling you that Imma get em when I see you coming with the rhetoric that let me know you wanna get annihilated
I am at the pinnacle of what I wanna be then leave an enemy in back of me and anybody violated
Put em at the bottom of the barrel Im a animal
I kill em with the ammunition there gon be no murdering me
Coming to the surface of the Earth and the purpose of work is the worth of a person per hundred million money for me
Protons neutrons electrons
Building blocks to a decepticon
You just met with tron the upset LeBron

Buy some love at the five and dime
A little bit of love from the counter store
Get it on credit if you need some more
Ill be the figure of your disgrace
A crisscross pattern upon your face
A womans just too tired to think
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink
I wish I was invisible so I could climb through the telephone
When it hurts my ear and it hurts my brain
And it makes me feel too much
Too much too much too much
Dont cut me down when Im talking to you
Cause Im much too tall to feel that small
Love is a temple love is a shrine
Love is pure and love is blind
Love is a religious sign
Im gonna leave this love behind
Love is hot and love is cold
Ive been bought and Ive been sold
Love is rock and love is roll

Aw yeah
Right about now its time to get busy
Huh straight out the box nonstop
Kurupt the Kingpin Xzibit Crooked I
Wait a minute um 
Crooked I
This is the art of manslaughter
When Im rockin Im more shockin than droppin a boom box in bath water
You entered the wrong scuffle
You catchin a chrome buckle
I uppercut niggas hard enough to break my own knuckles
Deliver the sick verbals
My shotty spit a round before you hit the ground
Your body spin around in six circles
Diminishin infamous menaces
Im waitin to get dicced if not Im a start finishin innocents
Lyrics lyrics Im breezin the region
Freezin gs in your legion
Freakin ancient techniques when Im speakin phoenician
Its all about Crooked
These bitches shout Crooked
Ill make you say the West Coast aint shit without Crooked
I own a vicious label niggasll get disabled
When Im spittin rhymes written on project kitchen tables
I load this 45 and let slugs dive at ya
Now thats for Crooked I the scrap happy mic snatcha
Daz
Motherfuccers can you dig that huh
Can you fucc with this
Lets get Kurupt the Kingpin to fucc yall niggas up
Yall dont wanna see none of this west coast MC shit
Yeah how you like me now motherfucker
Kurupt
Terror starts in the midst of your heart starts
The storm my vocals float like arks
In the mystic state of mind when I create a rhyme
My microphone massacres every year the same time
With audio amputations vocal thoughts of a loud talker
Up against the microphone night stalker
With a tendency of bashing MCs like ten of me
As you can see I continue mashin MCs
Kaboom the room gets cleared as my views get clearer
Extraterrestrial microphone terror
In effect get infected
Tell me what the fucc you expected
These venemous injections
I leave whole sections and sections full of injections
From these poisonous melodies and selections
I select the methods of slow anguish
I mangle shit with my language
Tell me have you ever seen one elope
With the microphone
In a scandal like abilities to make MCs explode
Baboom alone in my own zone
So dont compare me to none
Not ones nearly
Severe cause I severely impare MCs
Near me oppose and fear me I got plots and theories
Sincerely I could have the spot locked
Niggas get stoned for touching microphones
With no knowledge on how to rock
Daz
Yeah back in effect it dont stop
Turn your speakers up DJ Battlecat on the table
We fuckin it up like this and like that yeah
Got my homeboy Xzibit in the motherfuckin house
Alkaholiks
Xzibit
When I was enlisted
I came to the table double fisted
Sadistic heavy artillery for all my enemies
Bust shots up in the sky screamin obsenities
Make niggas sport khakis and chucks from here to Italy
Itll be a cold day in Hell when you see Xzibit fail
Act like a bitch on bail tuck tail and run
See we do it how it cant be done
Im the rough cut plus how the west was won
Or direct descendant of the gatling gun
Dont test me son you fucc around and catch you one
That aint a threat thats a promise I can definitely keep
You cant compete wit 25 niggas wit heat in the street
Ready to repeat round after round at you
All hell break lose when the whole Pound come through
I found that you and yours can never fucc wit mine
I own shit but gimme some more like Busta Rhymes
Cross the line now you gotta pay the piper
Im The Alkaholik sniper that be keepin the crowds hyper
Its ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Cant stop till me and my niggas is platinum plus
My Dogg Kurupt

Judge not less you be judged first
My nigga my nigga
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Burnin in hell but dont deserve to be
Got niggas I dont even know that wanna murder me
Just because theyve heard of me and they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real when you see that spark itll kill
Peep how I park it and chill take it over there walk wit it
From YO to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit it
Come through flyin up 129
Up the School Street cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs Get at me nigga
Get at me nigga
What the deal is Never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Cant help but feel this puttin goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
Its the calm before the storm
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and its gettin warm feel me yo
Look through my eyes see what I see

Look through my eyes see what I see

I can understand why yall niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
Cause I leave blood wherever I go wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark about to bark 
Take it to the heart cause its real like that
Give him chills but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real what you dont know is gon get ya
With the steel what you dont know is gon split ya
I can blaze tracks make niggas play racks and raise stacks
Paybacks a bitch didnt you used to say that
Play around in dirt youll get mud
Cause you know I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof make it a quickie for real
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street Yes 
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
I bear my soul niggas wouldnt dare my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time sold an eighth then told its not an eighth
But then its out of state and its too late for changes to be made
Thats what I get for fuckin with strangers in the shade
This is it yall niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight
Take away hate now Im supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldnt give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelins put aside cause now I gotta reach him
What Id like to do is turn my head like I dont know him
But it seems like Ive been called on to show him so Ima show him
And if you never met me then youve no right to judge me
Ive got a good heart but this heart can get ugly yes
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street Yes 
Look through my eyes see what I see
Do as I do be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Well late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long
Tonights the night yes it is

Early in the morning at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you wont too soon
Cause people let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that hed died out on the mainline

6602,"Midnight chillin at AM PM
Coolin drinkin apple juice
In Evils BM
The sounds up loud
To attract attention
Armor Alled tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin
Bumpin Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin
I was ridin shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin bout Get out
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool thru his fuckin mouth
Why would they step
When they know were strapped
I never cruise LA
Without a gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caught the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the car door
Thats where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin bad
The car seats were turnin red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadnt yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Take you on a walk through hell
South Central
Yo E drive drive drive man drive fuck it lets get the fuck outta here man
We boned down Vernon
Made a right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin through the ETGs
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
E where we goin
He didnt even answer that
Checked the rear view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from
What made these brothers come
Bang Our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didnt come to play
Bust a right turn parked
And then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched
Three of us bleedin
It was ten past midnight
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Midnight time for a homicide
South Central
Come on man yall bleeding bad man you gotta keep up man we cant stop here
I really didnt like
How this shit was goin down
Wrong night wrong time
Wrong fuckin part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoovers hood
Three niggas bleedin
That shit dont look good
See over there red dont go
Some places reds all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Broke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin crazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin worse
And Evil was gettin dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket but fuck it it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Take you on a walk through hell
South Central
Yall just lay down on the floor of this car fuck the police man imma handle this
When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I waited till they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked em up I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear yo Im outty yall
Dont know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers the cops
Dumped the GTA
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evils car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin bout my allnight death bout
Then somethin woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin police
When theyre tryin to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch
It was six in the mornin
",you gotta keep up man we cant stop here I really didnt like How this shit was goin down Wrong night wrong time Wrong fuckin part of town Ya see we was deep In the Hoovers hood Three niggas bleedin That shit dont look good See over there red dont go Some places reds all they know But not our luck Tonight we was real fucked Broke down an alley And we instantly had to duck Fuckin police on a gang sweep No time to deal with one time So we had to creep Broke through a back yard Ran through a vacant lot E Hen and Don kept up To be some niggas shot Shit was gettin crazy So I had to get busy Hen was bleedin worse And Evil was gettin dizzy Looked in a parking lot I needed a snatch bar Had to hot wire So I moved on an old car It was a bucket but fuck it it had to do Started it up And scooped my whole crew Two blocks later We saw fuckin blue lights The pigs were behind us It was half past midnight Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang Take you on a walk through hell South Central Yall just lay down on the floor of this car fuck the police man imma handle this When they pulled us over Shit got worse I waited till they got out And then I hit reverse Fucked em up I seen one cop fall Threw it in gear yo Im outty yall Dont know how But somehow we got away Lost the jackers the cops Dumped the GTA Made it back to the hood Fixed the crew up And even though Evils car blew up We made it home and then I crashed out Thinkin bout my allnight death bout Then somethin woke me up From my dark sleep The sound of fuckin police When theyre tryin to creep Broke through my door With no goddamn warning Looked at my watch It was six in the mornin,Midnight chillin at AM PM Coolin drinkin apple juice In Evils BM The sounds up loud To attract attention Armor Alled tires On a lowered suspension Nardi to steer with Alpine deck was glowin Bumpin Big Daddy And the nigga was definitely flowin I was ridin shotgun Donald and Hen in back Look through the tint recognized a jack Two brothers strolled up Talkin bout Get out Donald D blazed Shot one fool thru his fuckin mouth Why would they step When they know were strapped I never cruise LA Without a gat in my lap The other fool shot Caught the E in the shoulder blade I busted through the car door Thats where the nigga laid Hen jumped out Dropped two nines in his forehead Evil was bleedin bad The car seats were turnin red Looked to my left There were two more carloads Niggas in hats and hoods In an attack mode And they hadnt yet begun to fight E hit the gas It was one past midnight Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang Take you on a walk through hell South Central Yo E drive drive drive man drive fuck it lets get the fuck outta here man We boned down Vernon Made a right on Normandie Left on Florence Gettin through the ETGs Spun out on Vermont Made a left on Colden Right on Hoover E where we goin He didnt even answer that Checked the rear view They were still out back Where were these brothers from What made these brothers come Bang Our back window Was removed by a shotgun Now Hen G was shot Don caught a ricochet These motherfuckers was ill They didnt come to play Bust a right turn parked And then we got left Hid in the the bushes Shot the gas tank to fake death But would this really Keep them psyched Three of us bleedin It was ten past midnight Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang Midnight time for a homicide South Central Come on man yall bleeding bad man

In your circle dont mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
I plead the fifth Hell no and No your honor
So the streets honor me humble believe Im on it
I grab my momma Im headed to a different genre
They couldnt understand me now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy crack greed homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight nothing recent
But Ima call the state for back pay they owe me grievance
And you cant knock that block the block with the top that
Open up that Fanta I got that
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Lowlifes with no knives niggas is cutting throats
For that white like Tommy and green paper with the ghosts
Thats power I play my post one day
Youre the best thing since sliced bread the next day youre toast
I can never be toast hell no
I get money in lump sums yea I like my bread by the loaf
I like head by the coast as I stare at the pacific
She asked if I liked it Keep going girl youre terrific
Yeah baby see Im Clyde and Im looking for a Bonnie mami
To get a Gucci ghost watch rings from Avianne
I share my wealth humble beginnings hunger strangled us
Pops had a choice me or drugs he chose angel dust damn 
And the mother some was living more dangerous
Tax season the only time they was claiming us
Picture it like Kodak this bracelet you could hold that
If Im needed know that you can

Have you ever been to heaven
Have you ever seen the gates
Have you bowed unto your highness
And do you know how heaven taste Knock me down
Arm leg leg arm head this is God body
Knowledge wisdom freedom understanding we just want our equality
Food clothing shelter help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta aint no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They cant believe this much skill is in the human body
Hes 62 how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti
Aw fuck it you got me
Question religion question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Yall dwell on devil shit Im in a Diablo
Yellow shit color of JellO shit
Hello bitch its me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and
Have you ever been to heaven
Have you ever seen the gates
Have you bowed unto your highness
And do you know how heaven taste Knock me down
Thats me in the corner thats me in the spotlight
Losing my religion losing my religion
Getting ghost in the Ghost can you see me Can you see me
Have mercy on a Judas angel wings on a ghini
Im secular tell the hecklers seckle down
Yall religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess God in the flesh
Live among the serpents turn arenas into churches
Im like Michael recycle these are not 16s
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher hes a preacher Im a motherfuckin prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions I dont answer to these busters
Only God could judge us motherfuckers uh
Have you ever been to heaven
Have you ever seen the gates
Have you bowed unto your highness
And do you know how heaven taste Knock me down
Heaven or Hell the cards we been dealt
Are the cards that we play play play
Die for what you believe only one god recedes
When the shots spray spray spray

I can feel it 
Ready for war Joe how you wanna blow they spot
I know these dirty cops thatll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer the Punishers ready
Meet me at Vitos with Noodles
Well do this dude while hes slurpin spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fuckin floor
Joey Crack buck em all
If they move Noodles shoot that fuckin whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy
Little did we know that we riddled two middlemen who didnt do diddly
Itll be a cold day in Hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real I wouldnt hesitate to kill
Im still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mothers wake
Smack you then I whack you with my snub treight
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your familys children
Like Amityville and drill the nerves in your cavity fillin
Insanitys buildin a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanitys dealin
A villain without remorse whos willin to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support
I support Pun in anything he does anything he loves
A brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me
One of the best might be even better
Leavin niggas kneelin on they right knee
Spike Lee couldnt paint a better picture
You small change Im blowin out your brains gettin richer
Hit you with the MAC MAC 
Smack your bitch nigga what
You gettin stuck My trigger fingers itchy as a fuck
Truck jewels Jewels cruisin in the Land bumpin Cash Rules
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryna pass through
Thats true So who the next to get it 
TS the best that did it
Get it off your chest kid admit it and its 
Yeah And you dont stop
Twentyshot Glock with the copkillers fill em to the top
Yeah And you dont stop
Joey cracks the rock and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah And you dont stop
Well make it hot nigga what Bring it I blow your whole spot
Yeah And you dont stop
Its still 187 on an undercover cop
Fuck the police I squeeze first make em eat dirt
Take em feetfirst through the morgue then lodge em in the deep earth
The streets cursed the First Amendments culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights
Tonight I hold my rosaries tight as I can
Im one man against the world
Just me and my girl Black Pearl Latina ms fina but keeps it real
You know the deal we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it its no secret watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it
Creep with me as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kickin ass as I blast off heat
And you never see me talk to police
So you should know that I really dont care
Pull you by the hair slit your throat and Ill leave you right there
So beware its rare that niggas want beef
Big Pun speak and let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets
Fuck peace I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin
Catchin niggas while they sleepin no relaxin
Keep your eyes open sharp reflexes
Three TECs is in the jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors Terror Squad ghetto scholars
FullAClips mob inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down
Until Im locked and shot down
Heather B couldnt make me put my Glock down
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine I bust mine every time
Plus Im the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it go and get it
Set it baby and Ima bury ya
So remember the Squad that Im reppin
I fill a clip of my weapon and punish niggas til its Armageddon
Yeah And you dont stop
Twentyshot Glock with the copkillers fill em to the top
Yeah And you dont stop
Joey cracks the rock and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked

Well make it hot nigga what Bring it I blow your whole spot

Come on girls
Do you believe in love
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Dont go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know youve got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then youll know your love is real
You dont need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you til you cant come down
Youll never come down 
Dont go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know you know youve got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then youll know your love is real
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when youre not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isnt right then move on
Second best is never enough
Youll do much better baby on your own

Ive got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that youre really a part of me

I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well

Cause she know that folks catches strays like pet control
These are dangerous times the lifes on the line
A nigga might get it by the knife or the nine

Cause the grim reaper looking for a soul to take

8014,"Ahhhh yeaaaaaaaaah
Eightball MJG in the muthafuckin house
And we came here today to talk to you about this thing called pimpin
It has been misunderstood over the years
So now we have come to set the record straight
Niggas dont do this shit right
It takes a special kind of nigga
You know what Im sayin
Yeah
It takes a nigga thats hard from the start you gotta have heart
To meet a bitch mack her down then rip her apart
Its all in the game a nigga cant change
If you dont break a bitch then your game is lame mayne
See Im from Tennessee with curls and gold teeth
So everywhere I go bitches strike up conversations wit me
About the way I talk about the way I dress
About how my gold teeth look so fresh
See how I bait em in soon as a nigga speak
That deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
Im in my Cadillac chillin like a fat mack
Smoking on a fat sack drinkin on a pint of gnac
I pick up my car phone cause the freak beeped
Its my nigga baby mama but sometimes I creep
Thats just the way it is niggas have to take a chance
When you aint around anybody could be in that ass
But Im just a young nigga tryna make a dollar
And they way I live to some its hard to swallow
See livin down south aint what you think it be
Nine times out of ten niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah thats right
We trying to teach all these lames you know
How to do this shit
Cause its really a hard job
But them lame niggas
They make me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Now let me explain a pimp a nigga about the MONEY
See a ho break a ho
And try to influence the bitch to turn a trick for the nigga who
Persuaded her to sell ass like hoes supposed to
Now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
Surrounded by all these hoes thats goin and givin me money
Its funny how a ho can make you think she wit ya
When all the time shes just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
Take care of your business bring me the money
Yeah this shit is thick
Ho dont violate bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash grab on his ass write that trick a love letter
Train your woman to break a manman meaning another nigga
Just some shit in the game same ol same to make your pimpin thicker
Slicker the pimpin gets freakier gets the bitch
MJG is rich Im coocoo for these tricks
I pimp
Yeah thats right baby I pimp
So uh what you need to do you need to sit dat ass there
And uh right about now Im bout to fire up one of these spliffs
And get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah shit so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Part 2 its all the same G
Trying to school fools on this PIMP
Lesson one First you should pull a bitch fuck her good
Next time tell her no the next time take her dough
Oh you better watch your back too mayne
Cause theres a lot of bitches in the world wit much game
Lesson two Watch that ho dont trust her wit none of yo dough
Never let a bitch know how you make your cash flow
Lesson three If you dont tell that ho who is boss
Bitches like to run shit but end up getting smacked in the mouth
See a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
Push her head into the wall til you hear that crackin sound
Drown in the tub rubadubdub
Some niggas get pussywhupped and fall into a love bugs
Buying hoes this buying hoes that
Then bragging to your friends how you fucked her from back
Never how you took they cash never how you beat they ass
Never how you pull hoes fuck em then drop em fast
I dont understand your plan at all man
But you should be around niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah man these niggas a trip you know what Im sayin
But niggas like me I have to smoke them spliffs
To get my mind off that shit
And when I smoke em I get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
You know I stay high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Wherever there is a ho theres bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can tempt
A sucker will spend his money til he aint got nothin left
Instead of blaming the bitch he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldnt be a ho if it wasnt for the tricks
But I suggest we keep em so a pimp can keep his bitch
It need to be understood there wouldnt be one without the other
So why in the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
Jealous sucker just maaaaad
They cant hang with the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimps game
How in the fuck do you figure that pimpin is dead when nigga you know its alive
Pimpin is misunderstood by those who cant thats why they said it died
Others tried pimpin but was only makin chump change
One track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
Rearrange shit that they done seen in a movie script
Damn aint that a bitch niggas like me
Pimp
MJfuckinG PIMP
Staying down on this pimpin bout these hoes
But some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
And that shit just makes me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah yeah I get so fuckin high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground

7116,"My radio believe me I like it loud
Im the man with the box that can rock the crowd
Walkin down the street to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
Im sorry if you cant understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Dont mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past 10
My story is rough my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold and Im out to crush
My name is Cool J I devastate the show
But I couldnt survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radios bad from the Boulevard
Im a hiphop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it wont rewind
Cause I play every day even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
But I know I cant live without my radio
Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really dont care if youre jealous or not
Cause I make the songs you sing along
And your radios def when my records on
So get off the wall become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radios loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride yes the front and back
You would think it was a party not a Cadillac
Cause I drive up to the ave with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud it could rip your clothes
My stereos thumpin like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad cause the girlies scream
And Im still gettin paid while you look at me mean
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
But I know I cant live without my radio
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
And I know I cant live without my radio
Dont touch that dial Ill be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
Cause the radios thumpin when Im down to play
Im the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
Cause its a actual fact this jam is def
Most definitely created by me
Goin down in radio history
Im good to go on your radio
And Im cold gettin paid cause Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to diss
But its nothin ya frontin ya girl I am stuntin
And my radios loud enough to keep you gruntin
My name is Cool J Im from the Rock
Circulating through your radio nonstop
Im lookin at the wires behind the cassette
And now Im on the right standing on the eject
Wearin light blue Pumas a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
And I know I cant live without my radio
Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
Im on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
Ima make ya dance boogie down and rock
And youll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut Creator rock the beat with your hands
Thats right so dont try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and Earl chillin on the block
With my box cold kickin with the gangster rock
See people cant stop me neither can the police
Im a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool Js here to devastate once more
Pullin all the girls takin out MCs
If ya try to disrespect me I just say Please
Here to command the hiphop land
Kick it live with a box inside my hand

He alone decides who writes a symphony
He lights every star that makes the darkness bright
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night
He still finds the time to hear a childs first prayer
Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live
Hell always say I forgive
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold
He knows every lie that you and I have told

And you goin with it
Yeah nigga
Immortal Technique
Metaphysics
The blingbling era was cute but its about to be done
I leave you full of clips like the Moon blocking the Sun
My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch
Like an escape tunnel in prison I started from scratch
And now these parasites want a percent of my ASCAP
Trying to control perspective like an acid flashback
But heres a quotable for every single record exec
Get your fucking hands out my pocket nigga like Malcolm X
But this aint a movie Im not a fan or a groupie and Im not
The type of cat you can afford to miss if you shoot me
Curse the Heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts darkening dreams
No ones as good as methey just got better marketing schemes
Ill lead you to your own destruction like sparking a fiend
Cause you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream
And thats the primary reason that I hate yall faggots
Ive been nice since niggas got killed over 8ball jackets
And Reebok Pumps that didnt do shit for the sneaker
Im a heatseaker with features thatll reach through the speaker
And murder counterrevolutionaries personally
Break a thermometer and forcefeed his kids mercury
ARs tried jerking me thinking they call shots
Offered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox
Youre all getting shot you little fucking treacherous bitches
This is the business and yall aint getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke then Im taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load nigga Industrial revolution
I want fiftythree million dollars for my calloused hands
Like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban
And fuck packing grams nigga learn to speak and behave
You want to spend twenty years as a government slave
Two million people in prison keep the government paid
Stuck in a sixbyeight cell alive in the grave
I was made by revolution to speak to the masses
Deep in the club toast the truth Reach for your glasses
Ill burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
Innocent deep in a casketColombian fashion
Intoxicated off the flow like thugs passion
You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting
Youre better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion
Youre better off begging for twenty points from a label
Youre better off battling cancer under telephone cables
Technique chemically unstable set to explode
Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code
So if your message aint shit fuck the records you sold
Cause if you go platinum its got nothing to do with luck
It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
Stuck in the underground a general that rose to the limit
Without distribution managers a deal or a gimmick
Revolutionary Volume 2 murder the critics
And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets
This is the business and yall aint getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke then Im taking your company
You could call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load nigga Industrial revolution

6438,"Ayo this the one We all get caught in our own sins Sometimes I have to remind myself that on my worst day I live like somebody on their greatestand so do you Dont let your demons take you to Hell Introduce em to Heaven
Some niggas go to college some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die were just tryna live our life
Look I got homies in the ground skeleton and bones
And niggas doin life they aint never comin home
They said I wouldnt make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me cause she said I did her wrong
Cause I left to chase my dream get it any means
I said that Ill be back she wasnt listenin to me
That backandforth arguin was gettin in between
I said fuck them other niggas I go get it with my team
If we all grind we all shine fuck a parttime
I used to play the block early mornin and dark time
Now its G5 flights fuck a depart time
It was hard times nigga now its our time
Just take a look at my life rappin brought me back to life
Cause I was in them streets my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin like we was in Iraq to fight
Cause niggas gettin murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Whoa I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boilin water in the world of no order
In the hood aint no loyalty aint no world for your daughter
Aint no life for your brother on the life of my mother
Ima get the fam right nigga you damn right
Some niggas go to college some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die were just tryna live our life
Yeah I used to pop a lot of shit now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out hoppin outta shit
Right now Im prayin for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go I acknowledge it
But whoever aint a snakes usually a follower
Luckily I can tell the difference
My man comin home my other man gettin sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hatin on your pictures
We dreamchasin yall niggas walkin behind wishes
Without workin for it not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins others just find ditches
Just ask around bout the militia they malicious
Dblock finish that and cop more dope
Im twostroke you fourstroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Aint nothin all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand thatll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a headshot some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and theyll leave you
You cant see the Devil hes seethrough
Some niggas go to college some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die were just tryna live our life

6175,"Tell em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that Bimmer wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But Im dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard Afenis sons bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hiphop was better off when it was just Dre Scarface and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
Its a cold game nigga Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold caine thats a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange have to blow they mind Cobain
Mama forgive me cause Im tryna make a living hah
Them niggas hatin cause that Royce Phantom killing hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling hah
Me and Ye killing Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Lord willin I see a billion
Til then I let my nuts hang Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Thats the crack music nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music nigga
Im not an army Im a movement
The flow is water Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When Im talkin bout God she posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog steady postin bout her head
Got me thinking like a father is the world safe
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears sunk the Titanic
This is my life and its exactly how I planned it damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off poor kids is freezing
Cookin up in the same pot they aint got to pee in
Mama forgive me cause Im tryna make a living hah
Them niggas hatin cause that Royce Phantom killing hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling hah
Me and Ye killing Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Lord willin I see a billion
Til then I let my nuts hang Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers around greases make them cohesive
Im the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made its sorta Christlike
At the after party thinking what the afterlifes like
He paid for our sins is it really priced right
Fuck it I see the light broads they see the light
Cant deny my Jesus piece thats so Peterlike
Chicks crow for dough get low for mo
A convo piece she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle watch the chain glow
Mama forgive me cause Im tryna make a living hah
Them niggas hatin cause that Royce Phantom killing hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling hah
Me and Ye killing Something like my Jesus piece hah 
Lord willin I see a billion
Til then I let my nuts hang Something like my Jesus piece hah

Just let me be great
Let me be great
I feel like mothafuckin Cassius Clay right now
Genius
Dont be good my nigga be great
After that government cheese we eating steak
After the projects now we on estates
Im from the bottom I know you can relate
Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream Hov got a team
My chain already heavy dont let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush confetti on my fur
Turn right in Rutland niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
Im just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1 of a billion more than niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like its an everyday thing clean
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the uhh
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the lowlow
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murdered Malcolm gave Cassius the shakes
Wait tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know Im gon shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy basking on top
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Lets fuck up the world
Fuck up the uhh
Sipping DUSS boy this aint your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac me Im in the Maybach
This aint grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got strip clubs feeling like Oxford I swear
Teacherteacher Im trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught yall they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere you in the HOVs
Jordan 1s and dungarees
And thats just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
til we all check a billion shit its just the way Im feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling we just top what we top
Cause the bars dont struggle when the struggle dont stop
Just fuck up this world

Take you on vacation every weekend
Look I be up at six niggas sleep in

4412,"Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 1
Its like I have been living a lie
Its beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside
Im settled in somebodys dream
Seeing through one of his eyes
Pieces of somebodys mind
Pictures of thoughts in the frame
I stand alone in the dark now
Sad and crippled and shamed
I loaded my pistol and aimed
Cocked it quick and then bang
Woke up in sweat feeling the death
Creates an eclipse in the brain
Sometimes I think Im insane
I hear the voice when Im asleep
Whispers my name again and again
This is whats shes singing to me
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Verse 2
Sometimes I just want to cry
We kiss in the rain
She is speaking to me once again
Hands in my ear
But this isnt clear
I listen but nothings explained
This is a lie
A feeling inside
I still often drift when I drive
The tears they leave burns on my cheeks
Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down
A view of a soul
The heart of a woman is cold
My conscious is weak
She making me weak
The only love Ive ever known has left me alone
And Im dying inside
The only thing left is my pride
The pain you hear in my rhyme
For happiness Ill never find
All in my mind
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
Bridge
I think Ive finally failed at something
I honestly believe that
Cause looking at us from outside
You would think we would take better care of our hearts
I died when you did mentally
Spiritually
Im numb I feel nothing
Hook
The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips
All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips
And ever after seems so far away from me
The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips
",I listen but nothings explained This is a lie A feeling inside I still often drift when I drive The tears they leave burns on my cheeks Motionless mirrors with eyes staring me down A view of a soul The heart of a woman is cold My conscious is weak She making me weak The only love Ive ever known has left me alone And Im dying inside The only thing left is my pride The pain you hear in my rhyme For happiness Ill never find All in my mind Hook The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips And ever after seems so far away from me The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips Bridge I think Ive finally failed at something I honestly believe that Cause looking at us from outside You would think we would take better care of our hearts I died when you did mentally Spiritually Im numb I feel nothing Hook The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips And ever after seems so far away from me The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips,Hook The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips And ever after seems so far away from me The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips Verse 1 Its like I have been living a lie Its beautiful huh the way I can keep it inside Im settled in somebodys dream Seeing through one of his eyes Pieces of somebodys mind Pictures of thoughts in the frame I stand alone in the dark now Sad and crippled and shamed I loaded my pistol and aimed Cocked it quick and then bang Woke up in sweat feeling the death Creates an eclipse in the brain Sometimes I think Im insane I hear the voice when Im asleep Whispers my name again and again This is whats shes singing to me Hook The voices in my head are screaming louder than my lips All the words I should have said are slipping through my fingertips And ever after seems so far away from me The voices in my head are screaming louder then my lips Verse 2 Sometimes I just want to cry We kiss in the rain She is speaking to me once again Hands in my ear But this isnt clear

Im your host with the most CoolLoDee in the place to be
Whether youre moving your butt or cruisin in your truck
Turn the music up
We gonna get into this SONOGRAM jam by OneBeLo called Unparalleled
Cause no body does it like the SUB you dig
We hard to the apple core raps galore at your door
Pull crowds like a magic sword excalibor
Travel north on a saddled horse on a battle course
Rap in codes tap in morse Lo never lack the force
You need to practice more you aint in my categor
I rap for sport Trackezoids got my back support
So pass the torch and of course I can rattle yours ask for more
The more the Marry merry get your raps divorced
Slice like a razor blade mix tape brigade
Raps erase ya data base snatch your flavor call you Gatorrade
Trying to get major paid like the upper class
You cant escape from the wrath sufferin succatash
Bust your ass with a duffle bag full of mustard gas
Fingertips equiped with a touch of class
We touchin fans we trust no man here comes the plan
All we need is just a chance we must advance
This is who we are
No movie stars
No nudie bars
No jewelery jars
No groovy cars
Some truly are
We just wanna see some elevation in hiphop
Producers slash emcees when the beat drop
Magestik Legend

If you feeling this well
That means somebody need to say Oh Yeah Oh Yeah
Im just clowing you circus acts and nervous cats
With gerber raps I murder wax similar to Roberta Flack
Killing you softly with every word no time for stress
Petty herbs get addressed like the gettysburg
A hundred miles and racing with a wild imagination
Even if I get the job halfdone its halfamazing
Only obligation Trackezoid collaborations
Go together like masturbation and ejaculation
Coming with accurate calculations configurations
Like the pyramids lyrically theres no equivalent
Michigan citizens shouldve been sittin in Switzerland
Listen to lyrics I roll like a Michelin
Tired of rappers smoking phillies
Not really sayin nothin like Milli Vanilli my style Dont be silly
Dont need a filthy record deal people still feel me
Big willies hillbillies I rhyme without achilles
We keep it hot like the summer time when it comes to rhymes
What my tongue designed is nothin but thoughts from the mind
Ive come to find most cats is deaf dumb and blind
So I gotta scat and get mines underline
You lyin
Its raw talent no gimmicks no eye shadow
Keep yo costumes Im like hydraulics to shock value
Im not on clown labels Im black but not Sambo
A FuManChu swing karate chop samples
To body rock avenues while you shark mammal pop channels
Mock hip hop battles for stock capital
I can not help you lasso the black youth
Step into my classroom kid Ill take you back Roots
Ill give a Uncle Tom a shell toe with no lace
Im free from Amistad cant sell me no chains
I follow that mirage sell boat til one day
I found the underground railroad the SUBway

You know my thoughts dont fit the man

He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine

Screamin the chorus halfunconscious I hold my cordless
Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest

6425,"So I was relaxing at the spot
And some dude came through and was like Yo you got flows
I was like Of course and I asked him if he rhymed
And he was like Only when Im off this sizzurp
I love to rap I dont even care if youre whack
You got flows and a beat we can do that
He was like Okay but you go first so I spit an unedited
Spontaneous improvisational verse and we were chillin
Then this fool grabbed the mic and was like
Yeah I be killin stackin millions eatin children
Fuck a slut bitch I interrupted his ignorant ass
And said Unless youre trying to sound like Brother Lynch
On shermstick that the microphone you need to pass
You dont got a Bentley I just heard you talkin about your bus pass
He said Fool you dont know me
Im crazy blood Im a North End rider just ask my homies
I jack white boys like you I replied
Youre white too he said Honky I wear FUBU
Ill fight you Lets go head up
I told him My man slow your roll peep the flow and just wake up
Sampled 
Use your mentality wake up to reality
Use your mentality wake up to reality
Use your mentality wake up to reality
Use your mentality wake up to reality
So I was talking to one of my teachers and they asked me what kind of music I made
And I said Hip Hop Im an MC and I make beats
And he laughed and hes like
Mm you must be like Eminem
First of all hip hop is my life
My culture my blood and me being white
Doesnt have anything to do with my skills
He said Oh youre like Will Smith Puff Daddy dollar dollar bill bill
Nah bro
Never associate me with Eminem blingblingers RB singers
Im just sendin out words that the youth can relate to
So they can stay faithful
Themselves they regulate when ignorant people degrade you
You should respect one another youre a teacher
And still havent learned you shouldnt judge a book by its cover
He said Oh Im sorry brother calm down homie dont bust a cap in me word to your mother
I tried to help my teacher see the light
But ignorance leaves people in the dark seeing only black and white
I looked him in the eyes and told him straight up
You cant teach if you dont listen open your eyes and just wake up
Sampled 
Use your mentality wake up to reality
Use your mentality wake up to reality
Use your mentality wake up to reality
Use your mentality wake up to reality
So I was at the bus stop kicking a beatbox
And started conversing with some lady about music
And she asked me if it was true that
All people have guns smoke blunts and drink forties in hip hop
So I told her
Dont believe everything that you hear
The news associates acculturate violence and fear
Fear extorts fear
Hip hop is universal
A positive outlet with energy flowing through the circle expressing souls without rehearsal
A conscious movement in tune with
The mental physical spiritual side of the music
Its about love
Unfortunately its stereotyped as a culture thats based upon thugs
Hip hop is not about guns
And like all cultures yes some hip hop heads do drugs
Thats not even relevant
In moderation drugs can actually open eyes and expand the elements
Ive come closer to my ancestors remnants
Scripting my life through the force of their spiritual presence
I use my lyrics as the evidence
You question hip hops drug use
You should be questioning the Presidents

7516,"Bass for your face London
Everybody in the house make some noise
I want everybody in the house to say Ho Ho 
Yo Chuck kick it to em man
A ballad behind bars or you could say real rock from the rock An unusual musical happening in a most unusual place The state prison
Get in that cell nigga
I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself because they never did
I wasnt with it but just that very minute it occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweating as I dwell in my cell how long has it been
They got me sitting in the state pen
I gotta get out but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
Im not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
Word Public enemy serving time
They drew the line yall to criticize me for some crime
Nevertheless they could not understand that Im a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength the situations unreal
I got a raw deal so Im looking for the steel
They got me rotting in the time that Im serving
Telling you what happened the same time theyre throwing
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves oh well
The same motherfucker got us living in his hell
You have to realize what is a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up word em up on the level
The reasons are several most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto but only some I can trust yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
But I never did and plus I never been
Im on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked I never clock it yall
Cause time and time again
Time they got me serving to those to them Im not a citizen
But ever when I catch a CO
Sleeping on the job my plan is on goahead
On the strength Ima tell you the deal
I got nothing to lose
Cause Im going for the steel
Dont you know I caught a CO
Falling asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun and he did what I said so
And every mans demand got served
Along with the time they served decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warning I wanted the governor yall
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent because Im militant
Posing a threat you bet its fucking up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like Olivers neck I had to get off
My boys had the feds in check
They couldnt try nothing
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This what it takes for peace
So I just took a piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out to the ghetto no sell out
6 COs we got we ought to put their head out
But Ill give em a chance cause Im civilized
As for rest of the world they cant realize
A cell is hell Im a rebel so I rebel
Between bars got me thinking like an animal
Got a woman CO to call me a copter
She tried to get away and I popped her
Twice right Now who wanna get nice
I had 6 COs and now its 5 to go
And Im serious call me delirious
But Im still a captive I gotta wrap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand now Im looking for the fence
As I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers bruised battered and scarred but hard
Going out with a bang ready to bang out
But power from the sky from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose yes and some came close
I figure I trigger my steel I still stand and hold my post
This is what I mean an antinigga machine
If I come out alive then they wont come clean
Then I threw up my steel bullets flew up
And to my surprise the water tower blew up who shot
What who what the bazooka was who
And to my rescue it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway so I just got away
The joint broke from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher than the average bluffer
Cause the steel was black the attitude exact
Now the chase is on telling you to cmon
53 brothers on the run and we are gone

5473,"Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk
White miniskirt with a Betty Boop bum
She had an ass like Deborah Cox face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
At times she got my dingaling hard
When she said push hard she kept Vaseline
Open as she swung back couldnt help her dress blew back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rocking Wallows
Drawing cards sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolemite few tips from Goines
Birthday gave her two fifty cent coins
Puppy love gorgeous face amazed by lip gloss
Cherry scent when the princess spoked yo it bounched off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs Cole
Girls so pretty kids with little biddies hope the years go slow slow
Surrounded by intelligence life through education healthy minds will grow grow
Catch me on a busstop dusted cursin out the cops
But still come and vibe with me
Everybodys talking about WuTang fronting
But you still telling lies to me
Beautiful in lightshows having no intentions on love
But having strung I suppose here we go
Its not the way she bubbed the gum
Shooked her ass Im not the one
Double dutch waiting for the bus with faggot Laurie son
Now N Later lady 7th floor building 780
Fancy fox booties for her socks nothing else can change me
Young Nefertiti knowledge seed with no jewelry on
Tahitian fresh berry tree shes a capricorn
I really liked the girl had dreams about her
Thinking to myself some nights she got louder 
But hating was Sheneneh and Grace and Keylolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me you hit me Grace got the last hit
Eh yo the bitches started swinging and shit so I jumped in
Those were the days made faces in school plays
Paper trays city wide test made half a days
Shooting puppy water might hump the pillow dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga Ill pop her cherry for her
Fresh Air Fund nails done alphabets berets
Jellies bubble yum soda tongue too young to cum
Then engage him with them candy rings ayo I hit that shit
Got jealous when she kissed Rob
I broke her ChickOSticks
Guys and girls
Yall remember those days and shit
Girls walk around in school
One ponytail with the beret
Necks looking like baby powder youknowhatImean
Those were the days right there
Boston Baked Beans girls come to school with mad candy
YouknowhatImean
Youd just come in school for half days and all that
Just to see that little girl right there no mind to this

Once again its the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Aint it a shame rap is goin crazy 
The lyrical skills are gettin kinda lazy 
The gift theyre shootin couldnt even graze me 
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play G
Now who drops rhymes for the mind only a handful
Only the deaf dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet Im tired of hearin this
Bang bang shoot em up baboo you get buckbucked
If you aint down with whats up
Then you can get with these

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasnt
Nothin lyrical hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters nothin against your
Fake lifestyle but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive cause its inedited you think its better with
Explicit illicit lyrics but like a sedative
The rhymes aint hype so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brothers flows like
So here come the flow the lovable huggable colorful flow
The brother that glows in the dark cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe the highs and lows
Its up and down and out you go
So back up regroup slow down and check the cut
And if you still aint down get up on these

I always wondered how a rapper never could wreck shop
But if he had a funky track and a fat hook hed get props
Treated like some kind of hero most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one Im second to none
I come in the circumference 360 as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High you know the rhymes most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets I sinks the ships
So one shot aye captain I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin theyre mackin so I pimpslap em
Showin em whos large in charge runnin em up outta dodge

Grammar like a hammer information receivable
Sent by the Lord here and abroad
With words well adored now they cant be ignored
ForForForForce of course that makes Run the boss
So get lost because I just toss a punk
Make way today and if I may I say
I make pay with Jay so get away OKAY
Gainin weight I ate the whole plate to date
Never rate the great I go state to state
Just peep and keep but dont sleep or weep
Get deep to leap or Ill beep the Jeep
Put down the clown get round the town
I found the sound and Ill pound the ground
Get paid and laid not jayed or fraid
So I stayed and made not a bad debate
Got a group to troop with a shoop de shoop
Shoot hoop then scoop on this loop to loop
Goin off and on not soft of course
Just black and back to go back and forth
Go to school and cool not drool or pool
Got soul and gold and cold hold a jewel
Upset the best I met met a jest
Just lest the pest and I am the best
Got a punch to crunch cold munch for lunch
Not Grady or the lady from the Brady Bunch
Got Gs and Lees like Ds and Ts
Charge Bs to freeze all MCs with ease
No dope to cope just good to go
Theres hope to Pope big nope for nope
Quite clever and never were together forever
RunDMC and were Tougher Than Leather
guitar solo
Strong and mighty hard as can be
The perception of the life were as strong as D
Never frightened Im writin writin for whats right
Not schemin thievin in the night Im keepin with my mic
I got to go for broke and I aint no joke
I wont yoke and choke cept the suckers I smoked
Bumrush and crush leave em in the dust
I choose to bust the bust the scums who mess with us
Only strong survive and the weak will die
As long as Im alive I keep my head up high
Because Im strong in body and smart in mind
I was born to rhyme as a gift to mankind
No punk or chump never givin no slack
Well be killin a villain and like chillin Yo black
Im not a bum Im not dumb its me you run from
Im the king I do my things until my Kingdom Come
guitar solo
Cause Im
Rough and tough cold huff and puff
Dont bluff the stuff got enough to muff
Go long and on no longer song
Go on and on just for past the dawn
Put preach and teach with a speech to reach
All streets and each with beats for treats
Got the King Supreme may seem the clean
With a beat and a ring no dream machine
Not a gang to bang out to hang with slang
Talking yang and tang about everythang
Just brothers and others like fathers and mothers
Who discovered they love us that think theyre up and above us
No crime or time just rhyme and Im
Full grown and own no phone or dime
Just cut the stuff til you get enough
Cause were rougher than tougher and rougher tougher than tough
guitar solo
Ah with a voice like thunder words of wonder
Over all standin tall and the suckers fall under
Posessed with power cowards will cower
Ducks we devour hour hour after hour
Three man riot you cant deny it
Were so ill that you cant defy it
Gonna live POSITIVE forever AND EVER
RunDMC and were Tougher Than Leather

Wooo wooo wooo

Yo yo yo if you feel real good lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah yeah
Put them up put them up
Put them up put them up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Its been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Member when he told you he was bout the Benjamins
You act like you and him then give him a little trim
To begin how you think you really goin to pretend
Like you wasnt down when you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even foolin him
If you did it then then youd probably again
Talking out your neck saying youre a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Whore you going to tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass cause youre thinking its a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine
Dont be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now Lauryn is only human
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
Its silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans come again
Yo Awhen when come again yeah yeah 
When when come again yeah yeah 
My friend come again yeah yeah 
Guys you know youd better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Dont care who they offend popping yin Like you got Yen 
Lets stop pretend the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men still living in his mothers basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child supports late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
Unh unh come again

Hey we have some very intelligent women in here man
Do you think you too young to really love somebody
No no no no no
I say it for me and I am adult and I say wait you too young to be in love
This is silly you infatuated with them
You got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I dont know
It is a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody
Well you tell me whats the difference
Whats the difference
You can love anybody but when you in love with somebody
You looking at it like this
You taking that person for what he or she is
Not matter what he or she look like
And no matter what he or she do
If you can fall in love you can fall out of love
You might stop being in love with that person but you cant stop loving that person
Sometimes they never been loved before they never been in love before
They dont know the feeling to be loved
She poetic

5325,"Chorus Guru and Stikken Moov repeat 2X 
Whats the question Why are you flexin
Heres the answer choice of weapons
Yo The Remainz kid why you flexin like a bicep
Heat on your hip just to get a rep it aint worth it
Just because you pack a biscuit doesnt mean you cant
Become another statistic you figure it
Lifes a gamble even for vandalz I handle mine with minds
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest
The fear of layin in wreck causes the stress
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when its best
Yo little big man feelin your oats because youre strapped
Bustin a cap at another kid whos black
It aint all that when the shots are flyin back
You made a choice and the choice you made was wack
Kinda tipsy with the liquid confidence
Pullin your pistol when it doesnt make sense
To be the bigger man you figure
But in the end it dont pay when youre livin by the trigger
Chorus 2X
Yeah its the master of the who what where and the why
But still I got a problem with seein my brothers die
Ive been around and lived past the average age of us
In every obituary a full page of us
The game is money but what about inner wealth
The mental the spiritual and physical health
But still everyday the city is a test
Thats why some people feel a gun is the best
No doubt I pack protection but every altercation
Or situation doesnt deserve blastin I mastered precisions
Choice of weapon should I peel or peel out
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts
Chorus 2X
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam Stikken Moov swarm
Ready to bust off like Ron Jeremy but I chill G
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three
Thats why I wield the steel yes my microphone is crazy real
Im not the one sellin out to get the mass appeal
But jail cells are filled with my peeps
While the rest are gettin killed in these ill ass streets
Chorus 2X
So pick your weapon a mic or a gun
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns check it
Leavin the spot I seen some wild kids
One stepped to me asked me to freestyle kid
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side
I looked him in the eye smiled and walked to my ride
He was actin kinda hard on the surface
I said to myself that it really wasnt worth it
Yo you think youre all that cause you pack heat
Seein your own brother play the concrete in defeat
Tryin to prove yourself while you put the next man down
But what goes around comes back black best believe that
Chorus 2X
You know what Im sayin
Thats all the real heads all over the world
That realize that this music is real
That we keep it real like that
Peace to all my brothers on the third
And all the real brothers in hiphop
Its like a raps new generation thing baby
Peace to Guru
Its Panche the wild comanche suicide

I am as constant as a northern star
And I said Constantly in the darkness
Wheres that at
If you want me Ill be in the bar
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face sketched on it twice
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet
Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
Im frightened by the devil
And Im drawn to those ones that aint afraid
I remember that time you told me you said
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine
Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case of you darling
Still Id be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
I met a woman she had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said Go to him stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed
Oh but you are in my blood you are my holy wine
Youre so bitter bitter and so sweet

What Imma say cause I dont play
Youre gonna stand up and cheer
At the top of your lungs
Aint no stopping the Sun
Its a movement so move it

Bringing truth that was hidden
From the proof that was given
Make you forget about the life you used to be living
Time to make a change cause nothing stays the same
With discipline we can win and escape the pain
The spark will be within
Then hearts will beat again
What weve been taught must be forgot its time to see again
Up from the bottom we rise like the cream
They cant fool us nowadays were too wise for their schemes
Cut all the tough talking
Weve seen enough coughing coffin
You better recognize the time and get some stuff popping
No way to cheat us now
The babies need us now
Dont run look to the Sun
They cant defeat us now
See us now as we expose false knowledge G
Give new meaning for your life and for your own psychology

Its like War and Peace Yin and Yang Life and Death
You have to respect someone with my type of rep
So ink to the paper and paper to ink
Yall go ahead and be stupid for me its safer to think

I speak to open minds

Thats where the fellows hang out down there
They shoot pool you know
Goodbye everybody
Oh I do believe this is the end
Oh oh goodbye everybody
Oh I do believe that this is the end
Oh I want you to tell my baby
Oh to forgive me for my sins
A guy feels lonely then when you hear something like that
You cant do whatever you wanna do
Because your mind is on the person you know
You figure something youve done
You dont know what it is because she wont tell you
But every time you look at her she just starts to crying and wont say nothing
Then you say to yourself
Its my own fault baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Oh yes my own fault baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Because when you would love me baby
Oh a good time looked down
That wouldnt be true
I go up on my feet and I had a lot of friends
Now bad luck has hit me people
And now Im down again
Oh I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
Im blue and Im lonesome people
My heart is filled with misery
Once I had a lotta money
They say the greatest man until
But bad luck has hit me now
Pain has got me down
Yes I wonder why people
Why does everything have to happen to me
I say Im blue and Im lonesome people
My heart is filled with misery

Youll take my life but Ill take yours too
Youll fire your musket but Ill run you through
So when youre waiting for the next attack

The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death

The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall

We get so near yet so far away
We wont live to fight another day

Without a tear I draw my parting groan

Malice found religion Tony found prison
Im just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilos got a sibling
Father knows best wash my hands alls forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants Jacksons no room for George
Yeh the fear of Gods in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasnt disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime its revealed
What goes around comes around this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that Im free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but Id rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman say my name and Ill appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem pole whats my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
Im here now watch how many niggas plans change
First class flights Ciroc soaked nights
Waking up to models what a motherfuckin life

1523,"There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why oh why oh why cant my dream come true Oh why
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why oh why oh why wont that sun appear
Were lost in a cloud with too much rain
Were trapped in a world thats troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly He can fly 
Deep in my heart theres a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answers answers gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark theres a beckoning candle yeah
And while I can think while I can talk while I can stand while I can walk
While I can dream oh please let my dream come true oh right now
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah
",much rain Were trapped in a world thats troubled with pain But as long as a man has the strength to dream He can redeem his soul and fly He can fly Deep in my heart theres a trembling question Still I am sure that the answers answers gonna come somehow Out there in the dark theres a beckoning candle yeah And while I can think while I can talk while I can stand while I can walk While I can dream oh please let my dream come true oh right now Let it come true right now Oh yeah,There must be lights burning brighter somewhere Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue If I can dream of a better land where all my brothers walk hand in hand Tell me why oh why oh why cant my dream come true Oh why There must be peace and understanding sometime Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear If I can dream of a warmer sun where hope keeps shining on everyone Tell me why oh why oh why wont that sun appear Were lost in a cloud with too
5399,"I Believe When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever Lyrics
Shattered dreams
Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began
Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Without despair
We will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been
Must never end
And with the strength we have wont be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They wont be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind
Mm
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Ever ever ever ever
Ow
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again

Looks through pictures of the ones that he hasnt had yet
When he thinks he wants a closer look
He gets out his little black telephone book
Hes calling calling calling
Hes calling calling calling
Hes calling calling calling

Come sit down here beside me honey
Lets have a little heart to heart
Now look at me and tell me darling

Are you willing to sacrifice
And are you willing to be real nice
All your talent and my good taste

Still he just couldnt get off
Hes just another power junky
Just another silk scarf monkey

Do you believe in God
Cause that is what Im selling
And if you wanna get to heaven

Well Im counting my blessings
