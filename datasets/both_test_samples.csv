1529,"Ive been in this town so long that back in the city
Ive been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time
Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains
Once at night catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But shes still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dudell do in a town full of heroes and villains
Heroes and villains
Just see what youve done
Heroes and villains
Just see what youve done
Stand or fall I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And its all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains
My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started so long ago
Head to toe healthy wealthy and wise
Ive been in this town so long
So long to the city
Im fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff Im alright
By the heroes and

You gon be like Damn A rose grew from the concrete
Same thing with me yknahmean I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin Damn he did this he did this
Just be like DAMN He grew out of that He came out of that
Thats what they should say yknowhatImean
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty nasty
YknowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
Im just tryin to make somethin

7208,"The kiss of death on a rap pick
Then you get a slap quick so guard it with Chapstick
In other words protect and hold your own
It only takes one punch to get ya head flown
Fists of fury suckers get buried
Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
And nothin could save ya from catchin the vapors
Rhymes thatll sting your face like a quick jab
And Im rubbin em in just like Vicks salve
Captivatin dominatin innovatin illustratin fascinatin
Motivatin elevatin terminatin mutilatin
Rhymes theyre worth their weight in
Gold bold never sold to a bidder
That claim to glitter youre so bitter like kitty litter
As for damage dont tell me what another do
Cause I quote that Im RAW
So make room cause fighters are doomed
Try to consume and make your own tomb
A grave or a casket a tisket a tasket
Youre rhymes out of basket
Boy you get your ass kicked
For frontin like you hittin hard
When your arms are too short to box with God
So dont even touch cause I come with too much
Address and bless any mic that I clutch
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle he must be senile
And thats why meanwhile back at the ranch
The brother Asiatic chosen one is expandin with a new branch
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up sucker this is mortal combat
Make you say daddy I dont want none Kool Moe Dee
I seize and freeze MCs with these degrees
Put me to my knees or at ease Chiiiillld please
I break it down to bring on the next act
Rappers are so full of shit they need ExLax
So stop griffin your mind is driftin
Prepare yourself cause I get swift and
Captivate the crowd but you cant understand
At times I gotta say to myself God damn
As I get hot and still be gettin warmer
And I dont have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself never bother another
But if a rapper tries to diss I crush the motherfucker
Frontin MCs that be tryin to riff
Need to save it and dont even play with
Me when I react like a volcano eruptin
I step to you and say Now whats up then
Every wordll be just like surgery
Cuttin you open so rush to emergency
Or even bow to your knees and bend low
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
JOKES aint my style
I aint a child thats why I dont smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
So divine the other rappers need resign
As I go on from night to morn
Beginning to end from Knowledge to Born
Whenever rappers are lookin for static
Looks like a job for KingAsiatic
NE send me competitors
Then again it might just be better to
Just slow down you dont wanna throwdown
I get busy get you dizzy like a merrygoround
Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme
And competition prepare for wartime
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat
I roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol
Of folders molders towin black gold
So let it be said let it be read cause I lead ahead
Of others whose rhymes are old as ProKeds
Tryin to diss the Big Daddy repertoire Moi
You steady screamin out a antique segment wrote
As I just play em like a pregnant roach and STOMP EM
For tryin the forbidden
Your rhymes aint hittin boy you wont be gettin
None of or in front of cause every one of
My adversaries lack you little son of
Obituary columns will read your name
If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane
So any claimin or aimin to be champion
Against me Psssh cant be won
I rank supreme and its a rappers dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem
Cause theres only room for one teacher
Wise words from a wise manll reach ya
I teach freedom justice and equality
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
Slaves from mental death in power
Thats the reason before I drop this bomb
I say peace to the Nation of Islam
Make you say 6X daddy I dont want none 
Make you say say dadaddy I dont want none 
Make mamamake make you say daddy I dont want none 
Make you say 6X daddy I dont want none

3724,"Dirty old street all slushed up in the rain and snow
Little boy and his ma shivering outside a rundown music store window
That night on top of a Christmas tree shines one beautiful star
And lying underneath a brandnew Japanese guitar
I remember in the morning Ma hearing your alarm clock ring
Id lie in bed and listen to you gettin ready for work
The sound of your makeup case on the sink
And the ladies at the office all lipstick perfume and rustlin skirts
And how proud and happy you always looked walking home from work
If Pas eyes were windows into a world so deadly and true
You couldnt stop me from looking but you kept me from crawlin through
And if its a funny old world Ma where a little boys wishes come true
Well I got a few in my pocket and a special one just for you
It aint no phone call on Sunday flowers or a Mothers Day card
It aint no house on a hill with a garden and a nice little yard
I got my hot rod down on Bond Street Im older but youll know me in a glance
Well find us a little rock n roll bar and baby well go out and dance
Well it was me in my Beatle boots you in pink curlers and matador pants
Pullin me up off the couch to do The Twist for my uncles and aunts
Well I found a girl of my own now Ma I popped the question on your birthday
She stood waiting on the front porch while you were telling me to get out there
And say what it was that I had to say
Last night we all sat around laughing at the things that guitar bought us
And I layed awake thinking about the other things its brought us
Well tonight Im taking requests here in the kitchen
This ones for you Ma let me come right out and say it
Its overdue but baby if youre looking for a sad song well I aint gonna play it

Playa hatin pushin stolen whips
We at da dice game rollin trips out of town throwin bricks
Taking over cooking up coke with baking soda

Before i put da braids in i use to let the waves spin
What you be saying dont impress me at all
And them chicks u be jayin dont be sexy at all

Go head and front so i can try this right hand out
Across yo jaw L neva lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce tha law
You got sumthin to say then cough it out

Yall fellas like to stress them chicks impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks i sex them chicks
Then send them home corleone is known to be stoned
When i bone i rubber duck in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the grey BM went to the ATM
Took a thou out later on i had to wild out
In da club knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom pissed Cristal out
Now im thinkin what chick number i can dial out
Cuz its L the harlem pimp baby for real
I got more dimes then that sprint lady and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks but im tryna sell records like Garth Brooks
So f em all when its cold i throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on mega ice is what im heavy on
If it aint Cristal boo i guess its Prignon
If the nanas too tight i throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the 9 mil burst
Ive been off the scene over 3 years and cats is still thirst
They hear Big L drop a ill verse so all you unsigned cats that wanna battle get a deal first

Where your ass was at dog when niggas tried to run off
Where your ass was at dog You made me pull this gun out
Where your ass was at dog when I was in the Pyrex
Where your ass was at dog when I was drinking HiTech
Where your ass was at dog You came through the projects
Where your ass at We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the gram now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store
Had to struggle to get where Im at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt Amoco
12 tryin come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin out the stove and we still bangin honest
Blowing on the O yo we call that ho an onion
Man where your ass was at when we took the city over
Where your ass was at when all theyd ask was Whats the hold up
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news
Now your ass around because were paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help
Lawyers and the commissary aint gon pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I aint got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
Im selfmade selfish with my women selfemployed
Ill buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise
Man where your ass was at dog when niggas wouldnt feed me
Where your ass was at dog when bitches didnt need me
Where your ass was at Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at I had the 6 on my shoulders
Where your ass was at dog when niggas wouldnt feed me
Where your ass was at dog when bitches didnt need me
Where your ass was at dog when niggas tried to run off
Where your ass was at dog You made me pull this gun out
60 for a walk through bitch dont panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog when I was on my comeup
The reason Im here today cause I aint never gave up
Where your ass was at dog when niggas wouldnt feed me
Where your ass was at dog when bitches didnt need me
Where your ass was at dog when niggas tried to run off
Where your ass was at dog You made me pull this gun out

2932,"And Justice for All Lyrics
Halls of justice painted green money talking
Power wolves beset your door hear them stalking
Soon youll please their appetite they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I cant believe the things you say
I cant believe I cant believe the price
You pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost justice is raped justice is gone
Pulling your strings justice is done
Seeking no truth winning is all
Find it so grim so true so real
Apathy their stepping stone so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I cant believe the things you say
I cant believe I cant believe the price
You pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost justice is raped justice is gone
Pulling your strings justice is done
Seeking no truth winning is all
Find it so grim so true so real
Lady justice has been raped truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips now youre done in
Their money tips her scales again make your deal
Just what is truth I cannot tell cannot feel
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I cant believe the things you say
I cant believe I cant believe the price
We pay
Nothing can save us

4846,"It Was a Good Day Remix Lyrics
Hahahah
Thats right
Smooth hah
Yeah
Hahahahah
Just waking up in the mornin gotta thank God
I dont know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin from the dogs no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on but didnt pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do
Thinkin Will I live another twentyfo
I gotta go cause I got me a droptop
And if I hit the switch I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can do it all night
Called up the homies and Im askin yall
Which park are yall playin basketball
Get me on the court and Im trouble
Last week messed around and got a triple double
Freakin brothers everyway like MJ
I cant believe today was a good day
Creep to the pad and hit the showers
Didnt even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin didnt even look in a brothers direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to hort Dogs house they was watchin Yo MTV Raps
Whats the haps on the craps
Shake em up shake em up shake em up shake em
Roll em in a circle of homies and watch me break em
With the seven seveneleven seveneleven
Seven even back do Little Joe
Picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones and Im yellin Domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day
Hahah
Hahah
Left my homies house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna do since the twelve grade
Its ironic I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my Jimmy runs deep so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didnt hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and Im coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the threewheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter lookin for the murder
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cubes a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwin up
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didnt even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day

Last seen on my lambo coupe look sick it needs Campbell soup
Bet your man aint go these I dont think you want to gamble boo
Studio with my hood chick True Religions and bamboo hoops
Laid back coming up with shit she give me head while the sample loops
Horsey on that logo call my rari Polo
You obviously love my old hoes new meaning for YOLO
All you niggas gon learn today im the teacher im the tutor
A few Ray Allens a couple cuties and by Ray Allens I mean the shooters
Serious as a heart attack your girlfriend said she heard Im groovy
Curious as a white girl like hearing something in a scary movie
Dont get in that car girl last time youre gonna hear from her
Lost his bitch I bring her back like next time be more careful bro
Old moneys my lady new moneys my baby
Pimp cup getting licked up by few bitches Im lazy
If its 2 trips I want 80 these cool kids doin crazy
You rocking with the most shady keep tools gripped it aint gravy
All I know is liquor and two of us she prolly gon touch all of us
Im in my own zone my flows grown I made mine up on the short bus
Watch me hit my number again Im out that slum I come to win
He with me then he fam dawg cross him and Im jumping in
Homeboy I got pumpkin skin that mean shit dont get to me
My bitch dont care about no other name she just want know Tiffany
If looks can kill wed be all dead speed boat trips Im sick of sea
I asked her for some bomb head she told me No Diggity
One love to my family you dont look like no kin to me
Back hand like the Wimbledon shes goin off my energy

Yo yo Drew and Inf

Yeah to you forever from me to you
I heard somebody say Church Ima need a suit
Ima need a coupe I wont need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
I got the flow Im tryin to see the roof
Didnt wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do
But Ima leave it to God not Beaver neither you
Cause Ima murder Y kill O and even U
Man I got summer hatin on me cause Im hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin on me cause I aint never sprung
Winter hatin on me cause Im colder than yall
And I will never I will never I will never fall
Im being hated by the seasons
So fuck yall who hatin for no reason


Hey Mr Carter I am him

Two words you never hear Wayne quit
Cause Wayne win and they lose
I call em April babies cause they fools
And when they snooze we up
Feet up like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic I parallel park
In that redandyellow thing old school Atlanta Hawk
Like Im from College Park but Im from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream Soowoo and Dadadoe
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy fuck a pussy leave it there
Long hair dont even care
Hey Mr Carter Young I am him

Im right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B as I share mic time with my heir
Young Carter go farther go further go harder
Is that not why we came And if not then why bother
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
Im far from bein the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my names been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey got me a molotovcocktail flow
Even if you box well cant stop the blows
Kaboom The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also Im so fly Im on auto
Pilot while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros thats right plural
I took so much change from this rap game its your go
Hey Mr Carter Young
Its my go yeah And Ima go so opposite of soft
Off the richter Hector Camacho Man Randy Savage
Far from average above statusquo flow so pro
I know I ride slow and when I pass
They say What up killa Man stop bringin up my past
And next time you mention Pac Biggie or JayZ
Dont forget Weezy Baby

I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows thats what hell find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafs
And I only say Hello
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him like a ring to wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him
Secrets and sharing soda
Thats how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
Its secondhand
But Ill listen to his questions
Ill give my answers when theyre found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know she keeps him down
She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I dont believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And hell speak his sorrows endlessly and hell ask me why
Why cant I leave her

2223,"The Sad Caf Lyrics
Out in the shiny night the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Caf
Oh it seemed like a holy place protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like love and freedom
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Caf
Oh expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by
Some of their dreams came true some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind inside the Sad Caf
Acoustic Solo
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train it dont stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I dont know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Caf
Why dont you meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Caf
Saxophone Solo

3865,"You asked I came so behold the Queen
Lets add a little sense to the scene
Im living positive not out here knocked up
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up
This rhyme doesnt require prime time
Im just sharing thoughts of mine
Back again cause I knew you wanted it
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it
Dropping bombs youre up in arms youre puzzled
The lines will flow like fluid while youre guzzling
The sip I drop you on a BDPproduced track
From KRS to be exact
Its a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking
Cause its knowledge Im seeking
Enough about myself I think its time that I tell you
About the evil that men do
Situations realitywhat a concept
Nothing ever seems to stay in step
So today here is a message to my sisters and brothers
Here are some things I want to cover
A woman strives for a better life but who the hell cares
Because shes living on welfare
I government cant come up with a decent housing plan
So shes in no mans land
Its a sucker who tells you youre equal
You dont need himJohannesburgs crying for freedom
We the people hold these truths to be selfevident
But theres no response from the president
Someones living the good life taxfree
Except for a girl cant find a way to be crack free
And thats just part of the message
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do
Tell me dont you think its a shame
When someone can put a quarter in a video game
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street
You cant treat him the same
Its time to teach the def the dumb the blind
That blackonblack crime only shackles and binds
You to a doom a fate worse than death
But theres still time left
Stop putting your conscience on cease
And bring about some type of peace
Not only in your heart but also in your mind
It will benefit all mankind
Then there will be one thing that will never stop
And its the evil that men do

3251,"You never asked me what I wanted
You only asked me why
I never thought that so much trouble
Was resting on my reply
I could say it was the nights when I was lonely
And you were the only one whod come
I could tell you that I like your sensitivity
When you know its the way that you walk
Why do you have to say that theres always someone
Who can do it better than I can
But dont you think that I know that walking on the water
Wont make me a miracle man
Babys got to have the things she wants
You know shes got to have the things she loves
Shes got a teninch bamboo cigarette holder
And her black patent leather gloves
And Im doing everything just trying to please her
Even crawling around on all fours
Oh I thought by now that it was gonna be easy
But she still seems to want for more
Why do you have to say that theres always someone
Who can do it better than I can
But dont you think that I know that walking on the water
Wont make me a miracle man
Oh yeah
Never given you a bad reputation
Just because youve never been denied
You try to say youve done it all before
Baby you know that you just get tired
Yet everybody loves you so much girl
I just dont know how you stand the strain
Oh I Im the one whos here tonight
And I dont want to do it all in vain
Why do you have to say that theres always someone
Who can do it better than I can
But dont you think that I know that walking on the water
Wont make me a miracle man

Living in this world
Whats happening
Whats happening check it out
Its critical the situation is pitiful
Bear in mind you gotta find somethin spiritual
We never gain cause we blame it on the system
You oughta listen whether Muslim or Christian
Or any other type religion or creed
Cause what we need is less greed
We cant continue to kill ourselves
We gotta build and expand our wealth
So one more time Ill design a rhyme divine
To educate and elevate your mind
Nowadays we gotta fight to live
Human means we got a right to live
Without the homicide without the genocide
Dont tell me let it slide Im feelin ghettofied
So be a soldier of truth
Protect the lives of our youth
Living in this world
Whats happening
Living in this world
Whats happening
Whats happening
In the land of the free home of the brave
Too many of us reach such early graves
They tell us to behave but they dont know
About the neighborhood drug flow
They dont know about the drama or about the guns
I ask how many politicians steal our funds
And how many officers will turn up corrupt
The governments dont care they pass the buck
Im growin tired of the trickery
And the misery its makin me kinda sick you see
But now I meditate so I can get it straight
My thoughts penetrate so I control my fate
So be advised by the wise and concious one
We take the easy way out too often son
We better get some kind of work ethic
Realize it and correct it
Living in this world
Whats happening
Living in this world
Whats happening
Whats happening
From New York to LA dead children lay
Victims of an unfair society
But for those who are blessed
We must correct this mess or dissapear into nothingness
Were living in the age of doom
How many teachers reach all the kids in the classroom
The beast is stalking us but theres no stopping us
As long as we maintain the strength within us
Cause were winners descendants of the kings
They try to hinder us from doin our thing
So get the money but spend it wisely
I get ill when the beats hypnotize me
Realize that the key
Is for each to master his own destiny
Deal with reality and keep a tight focus
Cause theres a lot we got to cope with

Sit back Im about to begin 
I drive up and down Harlem blocks icedout watch
Knots in my socks cops think Im selling rocks
Pulling me over to see if Im drunk but Im sober
They wouldnt fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo youre mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names try to hurt my pride
Youre just mad cause Im a young cat pockets dumb fat
Talking bout Where the gun at I been there and done that
Im through with that illegal life Im staying legit
I love to see cars come cruising by and playing my shit
I walk around with six thou without a pistol my whole cliques wild
Im rich pal no more sticks Im making hits now
I drink Cristal Im through breaking laws
I dont sell coke any more I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes will do whatever it takes
Word up them Federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mousetrap I doubt that
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Aiyo enoughs enough Federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus they want a niggas soul but they know
Big Joey Crack will never rat a cat that he know
For sure death before dishonor I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So Ima keep doing what Im doing
Pursuing my dream till theres enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So wheres your witnesses that you claim to have
Saying that Im taking half extorting New York and not paying tax
Im laid back playing the role laying the low
But its the same old Joe so dont get KOd
Hey yo Im gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid why dont they just let a nigga live
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
What would you do if a vicious enemy
Suddenly started coming at you
Armed to the teeth and ready to kill you

3170,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since weve no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
It doesnt show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How Ill hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home Ill be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear were still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
He doesnt care if its in below
Hes sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He dont care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let It Snow 
OoooohWee goes the storm
Why should he worry when hes nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says Let it snow let it snow

To the mothers they deceited to the fathers they mistreated 
To the sisters they misleaded to the brothers that get beated 
All of us all of us all of us all of us all of us
This is happening to all of us
Yeah if our struggle is a strain then the strain is dominant
My name is prominent for entertainment thats laced with consciousness
But really its just common sense like Lonnie Lynn
You dont need binoculars to see the light coming through the dome like its an oculus
The common myth that were savages with no history or accomplishments
Or knowledge of ourselves they did a job on us
Considering the prediction of economists machines will do our jobs for us
The future for the working class is ominous
They got us indoctrinated through a bitchs brew a religion mixed in with abuse
Emotional we sit in pews its physical we get the noose
And hang ourselves refusing to name ourselves refuse to change ourselves
When I talk about our past it doesnt ring a bell
They make you hate yourself it take effort so check the method
Theyll take you from your family your kids will never respect ya
Attach your sins to the black of skin we get the message
We start acting if we cracking the whip better than the oppressor yes
Every problem cant be solved at the ballot box
We unifying Africa like Gaddafi thats what got Malcolm shot
They out to stop anybody with knowledge that figured out the plot
On the balcony like Martin Luther King I been to the mountaintop
The blue wall of silence its really the blue wall of violence
The good cops who retire and get fired
They screaming black on black as an excuse for you to not care
Til the cops roll up in their SWAT gear


I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan
Sweating all through the night just like the Holy Prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with J Cole and Kweli
Just before Jehovah the God crowned me the king with his goldie locket
Alhamdulillah weve come really far aint it
The little engine who could could power any car cant it
The mothers in Chiraq say the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times the holy Quran and Bible
We on the last page and line the verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the matrix inside of the spaceship but the saviors blind
Or so it seems years after Noah was told he would row upstream
The heavens bursted and the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who worked the chain gangs
I hit that shmoney dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state be sprayed into the backstreet to the driveways
Officer friendly is an enemy now looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the asiatic ancientsemitic peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple

To the sisters disrespected to the brothers unprotected

The children start to march
Against the world

Theyre tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
Theyll fight the world until theyve won

Children of tomorrow live
In the tears that fall today

Bring in peace in any way
Must the world live in the shadow
Of atomic fear
Can they win the fight for peace
Or will they disappear Yeah

Young black intelligent this is not a first
But it feels like its curse and it weighs like a elephant
Heavy on my mind cause I feel so irrelevant
Heavy on my heart its like Im smart for the hell of it
Heavy on my soul its our stroll through the ville again
Stranded on this island feel like Im Gilligan
Friends got jailed and then they got bailed
Stress that Im under I just wonder when they kill again
Please understand that Im living in the concrete
Jungle where I stumble is the crumble under my feet
In the building lobby see my man Bobby
Puffing on a joint thats the point where our eyes meet
Asked whats the weight on the books in my knapsack
Hes so amused Im confused why he asked that
Then I understand the motive and the plan
Hes trying to be the man while I stand getting laughed at
Dudes got jokes but very little hopes
Thats why they trying to bring me down like a halfback
But I got balanced my moms made a promise
If I get the grades Ill be praised like Thomas
Clarence but I dont know if laws in my future
Cops in the war and theyll sure try to shoot ya
All I wanna do is get a B in geometry
Lose my virginity and live my life drama free sing
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I why be I
Why be me why be me
If I fly if I fly
They gon see  they gon see
I might die I might die
But Ill be free but Ill be free
So why be I why be I
Why be me why be me

Penny for your thoughts a nickel for your dreams
A dime for your goals and a quarter in your jeans
Trying to make a dollar outta fortyone cents
Caught up in the barbed wire shorty on the fence
I can be a knifepacking guntoting hooligan
But I cant decide so Im on my way to school again
On my way to duel again me against the world
But all I can think about is me against a girl
Youthful exuberance busting at the seams
Look at all the other kids cussing at the deans
Looking at all the other kids cutting 8th period
But Im on a team and my coach wont hear of it
Hes well aware of it I aint getting pinched
Yall dummies go ahead I aint getting benched
Whole lot of right and a little bit of wrong
And everything youve worked for Gone
As I sit and count these clouds
I sure hope my ma is proud of me
Why be I why be I
Why be me why be me
If I fly if I fly
They gon see  they gon see
I might die I might die
But Ill be free but Ill be free

In this state of emergency and sense of urgency
Just how young is young
Cause the youth be not youth for long
Young society might be afraid of you
But you continue to be you
We are you so we feel you
For that those that see you
We salute you
Continue to find like minds brah
Design your inside concentration desire
Dedication inspiration perspiration
Is the hard work
Doesnt guarantee anything
But without it you dont stand a chance
Intelligence will save you
And us too

4527,"4 3 2 1 Original Verse LyricsMethod where the gods at Redman where the squad at
Yo L is that a mic on your arm Let me borrow that
Whos the God of rap you saying is nice
Ill beat a dead nigga to death and beat a dead nigga to life
If you look at me long enough Ill start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough and then Ill call your bluff
Lets see how many rhymes you got
I can go on for more Millenias than Mazdas got in a car lot
And theres nowhere to run to when I confront ya
Nigga Ill call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surfacetoair missile
I take them in all shapes sizes and forms spit on
Any emcees who aint close enough to shit on
Zero to 60 Im already doing a hundred when Im blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it
Your head will spin so fast youll catch whiplash
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass
Make your hard drive crash the C colon backslash
And Ill go back to the booth to school your whack ass
Because the object of the game is to spark every cell in your brain
At degrees hotter than blue flames
Propane gasses it incinerate you into ashes
I got you breathin harder than girls in Lamaze classes
Stop bitchin about if its written or freestyle
Got the whole Spanish community saying Im muy mal
Charging niggas with booty styles 50 fines
In addition to 25 for whack punchlines
Cause Im the top dog running the yard
And I represent cause I never chained to the fence
Hence to battle me is impossible
Ill put your whole crew in the hospital with IVs all in their nostrils
Stop sleeping on me I aint a mattress
Put you through more drama than a soap opera actress
Dont even think about pulling out and opening fire
Gunshots wound but I remove bullets with pliers
I aspire to kick the fattest that youve ever witnessed
From a far side thats even confusing the fat lip
Rhymes designed from lines of pure knowledge
Ill make your head nod til your neck runs out of cartilage
I think its obvious that I can bring the ruckus
Scream on your crew like a military drill instructor
When I come through niggas stand stiller than statues
If I have to Ill battle your whole rap crew
Then Ill attack you with words thats absurd
And rip your fucking skin off just to get on your nerves

3620,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled fuel injected and steppin out over the line
Oh baby this town rips the bones from your back
Its a death trap its a suicide rap
We gotta get out while were young
Cause tramps like us baby we were born to run
Yes girl we were
Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
Well run till we drop baby well never go back
Oh will you walk with me out on the wire
Cause baby Im just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh can you show me
Beyond the palace hemipowered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
1 2 3 4 The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybodys out on the run tonight
But theres no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
Ill love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh someday girl I dont know when
Were gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go and well walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us

Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of twotens not from an oven but MAC10
A MAC20 maybe if I didnt subtract ten
My background straight from a Black mans culture
Want more Buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle damn you too hard to handle
EDouble slam once and Redman slam two
Break hooks earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor make mines the PFunk

6712,"Im TNT and I just cant lose
An EMCEE with a fuse
When its lit Im hit with the lyrical wit
Of a scientist thats tryin this
Sugar coated rhyme loaded with gunpowder
Now see how the crowd will yell louder
Now the rhyme is dropped and you hear a pop
Think its a shot but you just cant stop
Your heartbeat vibrates at my rate
So why wait I hate to be irate
Anger causes rhyme combustion
Like a tornado the winds start gustin
Rhymes unload reload and explode
Ride the same wave Malcolm X rode
On a higher level cause I left the rest
Outcast outlast F the press
When I hit its like a bulldozer
Boom and there goes ya
Whole world up in smoke
When I go I go for broke Im blowing up
Im on the hype tip Im on the mic with
Tunnel vision cause Im mic whipped
Strung from lung to tongue
I breathe rhymes that come from
A zone thats hidden and forbidden
If any man enters good riddance
A mortal mind is just no contest
The rhyme zone is my conquest
The Twilight Zone will seem like childs play
Am I a genius Heheh Ill say
Im so cool and yet so hyped
When Im on the mic its something like
Hiroshima remember Pearl Harbor
Feel the fire but dont bother
To run for cover you dont escape
On record compact disc or tape
Once you play it the fuse is lit
An explosion you getting hit
With rhythmic prophecies visions I foresee
Me blowing up in your face now stop to see
Smoke fumes in the shape of a mushroom
Cloud the room because I went boom
Ill light the sky like a comet
When it comes to rap Im it Im blowing up
Im blowin up for the fans that crave
Hip hop with relevance Im here to save
Rap from an early grave like god I gave
Life to the mic as I watch it enslave
All the sellouts who yell out obscenities and spell out
MONEY to propel out of the ghetto but like Othello
You kill the mic a cappella youre in the cellar
You rap like rap is a dash for cash youll run out of gas
Its a marathon how long can you last
With repetitious nothing renditions of something
You cant create so you imitate the pumping
Only the strongest can last as long as
I last my reign is the longest
In hiphop history check the book
Victory after victory man look
Rapping is a science the mic is an appliance
So I applied it to an alliance
Of words put them in a rhyme song
Blew them up like a time bomb
Other emcees caught the debris
Little bits and pieces of me
Put my ideas on a track you laid
Is like pulling my pin and Im a grenade Im blowing up
Clap your hands to that
Old track that brought back the man that raps
Much better than the next man Ill take an exfan
And make them rock harder than any other brother can
Whoever didnt understand my game plan
Should feel ashamed like a lame cause Im the same man
That ran the rap yard for years worked hard for years
But never got paid and slaved and starved for years
Then other rappers came off with rhymes that are soft
I went with the flow and you said I fell off hah
Dont be bogus wheres your focus
I did what I had to now notice
The dollars are rolling no more holding
Back the rap attack Im back on top controlling
The whole rap game again like I did way back when
Def Jam was a dream I was slaying men
Whoever thinks he wants some he dont want none
Hes got to be insane or just plain dumb
But if you think you got something to prove
Jump make your move
But come in a tank and ten suits of armor
I wont whip ya Ill bomb ya
And when youre on fire it still aint enough
Cause I dont just burn you boy I blow ya up

If you ask Ill be honest girl you not the only one
Just a man on a mission with my hand on my gun
Couple niggas that hate me but way more people show love
Niggas tryin too hard they dyin to ball
Then turn around and hate on me like its a crime to evolve
Too afraid to be different too ashamed to just listen

Tried to hate on my Crippin tried to hate on my business
Not to call you a bitch but they gon hate on my bitches
So if you fucking with Nip let you know my intentions
Got to think like a rider you gotta know your position

Pop the cork off this imperial Veuv
Crank the music blowin circles out the roof

3509,"Sacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife thats rich with fruit of all the gods
And to face the demons
Of their underworld haunts
The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to fulfill mans desire
By power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two headed reptile symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld
A life thats full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last for an eternity
After living in a golden paradise the ultimate sacrifice
Prophecy of sky gods the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages forest of kings
The search for the truth the book of souls
The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn
They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown
Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies
Prophecy of sky gods the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages forest of kings
The lost book of souls destruction begins
Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed
Domain of the Earth to the journey of truth
The underworld caves Mayan slaves
Defeat of the dark Lords the ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule
The book of souls

Enraged and full of anger hes half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller

A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels

Louder than an atom bomb

5213,"You say one for the treble two for the time
Come on yall lets rock this
You say one for the treble two for the time
Come on
Speech is my hammer bang the world into shape
Now let it fall huh 
My restlessness is my nemesis
Its hard to really chill and sit still committed to page
I write a rhyme sometimes wont finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically addminister subtract the wack
Selector wheel it back Im feeling that
From the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto stay fluid even in staccato Mos Def 
Full blooded full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow Theres the hum
Young man where you from Brooklyn number one
Native son speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow there it is 
While you still tryin to find where it is
Im on the Ave where it lives and dies violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the Kings Engalish
But caught a rash on my lips so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the baseline swish 
Move like an apparition low to the ground with ammunition
Chichipow Move from the gate voice cued
On your tape putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate who choosing your fate yo 
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping to BeBopping to HipHopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man got the whole world watching
Where ya at Im high low east west all over your map
Im getting big props with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock the fairweather friends flock
When your chart position drop then the phone calls
Chill for a minute lets see who else hot snatch your shelf spot
Dont gas yourself akh
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked rock rock rock rock 
The more emotion I put into it the harder I rock
Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits hungh Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline its low life getting treetop high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory a class E felony
Facing the death penalty hungh 
Stimulant and sedative original repetitive
Violently competitive a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to BBoys getting busy
The wartime snap shot the working mans jackpot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the havenots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops woooo 
Its allcity like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you praise you pay you
Do whatever you say do but black it cant save you

Back in nineteenfiftyfive
Man didnt know about a rock n roll show
An all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news
He said Let there be sound
There was sound
Let there be light
There was light
Let there be drums
There was drums
Let there be guitar
There was guitar
Oh let there be rock
And it came to pass
That rock n roll was born
And all across the land every rockin band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The businessmen got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteenmillion fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar
Oh let there be rock
One night in the club called The Shaking Hand
There was a 42 decibel rockin band
And the music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd
Let there be rock

865,"The path is clear
Though no eyes can see
The course laid down long before
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Though many times theyve seen the way to leave
He rides majestic
Past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy
To see reflected there
The trees the sky the lily fair
The scene of death is lying just below
The mountain cuts off the town from view
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill
Let it be revealed
A waterfall his madrigal
An inland sea his symphony
Na na na na na
Na na
Undinal songs
Urge the sailors on
Til lured by the sirens cry
Now as the river dissolves in sea
So Neptune has claimed another soul
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Until the shepherd leads his flock away
The sands of time were eroded by
The river of constant change

8114,"Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit It was now midAugust which meant he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months Two months and all he had to show was three dogeared letters and two very expensive longdistance phone calls True when school had ended and shed returned to Wisconsin and he to Locust Pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity She would date occasionally but merely as amusement She would remain faithful
But lately Waldo had begun to worry He had trouble sleeping at night and when he did he had horrible dreams He lay awake at night tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector tears welling in his eyes as he pictured Marsha her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some neanderthal finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion It was more than the human mind could bear
Visions of Marshas faithlessness haunted him Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts And the thing was they wouldnt understand how she really was He Waldo alone understood this He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche He had made her smile She needed him and he wasnt there Awww 
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers Parade was scheduled to appear Hed just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons lawn for a dollar fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha There was nothing but a circular from the Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America inquiring into his awning needs At least they cared enough to write
It was a New York company You could go anywhere in the mails Then it struck him He didnt have enough money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion true but why not mail himself It was absurdly simple He would ship himself parcel post special delivery The next day Waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment He bought masking tape a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build He judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably A few air holes some water perhaps some midnight snacks and it would probably be as good as going tourist
By Friday afternoon Waldo was set He was thoroughly packed and the Post Office had agreed to pick him up at three oclock Hed marked the package Fragile and as he sat curled up inside resting on the foam rubber cushioning hed thoughtfully included he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marshas face as she opened her door saw the package tipped the deliverer and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person She would kiss him and then maybe they could see a movie If hed only thought of this before Suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up He landed with a thud in a truck and was off
Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair It had been a very rough weekend She had to remember not to drink like that Bill had been nice about it though After it was over hed said he still respected her and after all it was certainly the way of nature and even though no he didnt love her he did feel an affection for her And after all they were grown adults Oh what Bill could teach Waldo But that seemed many years ago
Sheila Klein her very very best friend walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen Oh gawd its absolutely maudlin outside
Ach I know what you mean I feel all icky
Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table licked her finger and made a face Im supposed to be taking these salt pills but she wrinkled her nose they make me feel like throwing up Marsha started to pat herself under the chin an exercise shed seen on television God dont even talk about that She got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins Want one Supposed to be better than steak and then attempted to touch her knees I dont think Ill ever touch a daiquiri again
She gave up and sat down this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone Maybe Billll call she said to Sheilas glance Sheila nibbled on a cuticle After last night I thought maybe youd be through with him I know what you mean My God he was like an octopus Hands all over the place She gestured raising her arms upwards in defense The thing is after a while you get tired of fighting with him you know and after all I didnt really do anything Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him You know what I mean She started to scratch Sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth Ill tell you I felt the same way and even after a while here she bent forward in a whisper I wanted to Now she was laughing very loudly
It was at this point that Mr Jameson of the Clarence Darrow Post Office rang the doorbell of the large stuccocolored frame house When Marsha Bronson opened the door he helped her carry the package in He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had gotten out of her mothers small beige pocketbook in the den
What do you think it is Sheila asked Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back She stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room I dunno
Inside the package Waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the muffled voices Sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton Why dont you look at the return address and see who its from Waldo felt his heart beating He could feel the vibrating footsteps It would be soon
Marsha walked around the carton and read the inkscratched label Ah god its from Waldo
That schmuck said Sheila Waldo trembled with expectation Well you might as well open it said Sheila Both of them tried to lift the staple flap
Ah sst said Marsha groaning he must have nailed it shut They tugged on the flap again My God you need a power drill to get this thing open They pulled again You cant get a grip They both stood still breathing heavily
Why dont you get a scissor said Sheila Marsha ran into the kitchen but all she could find was a little sewing scissor Then she remembered that her father kept a collection of tools in the basement She ran downstairs and when she came back up she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand This is the best I could find She was very out of breath Here you do it IIm gonna die She sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap but the blade was too big and there wasnt enough room God damn this thing she said feeling very exasperated Then smiling I got an idea
What said Marsha
Just watch said Sheila touching her finger to her head
Inside the package Waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe His skin felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart beating in his throat It would be soon Sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package Then she sank down to her knees grasped the cutter by both handles took a deep breath and plunged the long blade through the middle of the package through the masking tape through the cardboard through the cushioning and thud right through the center of Waldo Jeffers head which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun

Well buy the house
Youll need to rest
But now well make it

The clinic called
The xrays fine
I brought you home
I just said home
Sue you said you want it writ
Sue the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words
For I know that you have a son
Oh folly Sue
Ride the train Im far from home
In a season of crime none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue Ive pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face
I touched your face
Sue goodbye
Sue I found your note
That you wrote last night
It cant be right
You went with him
Sue I never dreamed
Im such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown

Why Im so clean Im next thing to Godliness
Niggas try to starve my kids and give my money to his first born
Im not the nigga posed to work for em
You pose the teach culture P about your legacy
And said that niggas follow you you teaching treachery
And now you say you check for me without a check for me
Now what you talkin bout this murder niggas double jeopardy
Niggas sayin let it go you buggin nigga I cant let it be
Tell niggas dont call for me I can only talk for me
I know what my budget read I read the budget every week
Im on the way I talk but its a way out for me

Now I fire on Goliath and watch him fall
Didnt want to kill the short first cause I come for the tall
And when your main artist died who the hell did you call
I bring smoke with water on Im used to the fog
And I empty pipes when clips get clogged
And go to church on Sundays Im the illest of all
Dont ever put Mase with other Bad Boys who had hardship
You know I get it jumping like a mosh pit nigga
Im the first level dirt level yall can never hurt level
Niggas mad I made it to the I will never work level
Since Cain killed Abel Im able to kill Cain
And Love dont steal my nigga change your name
And I see no integrity in you name
And Im haunted by the voice of St James
Champagne came matched my Rollie plain jane
And I say blame God I aint changed
And if niggas never found the killer why is nigga livin here
Everybody Brooklyn niggas gotta play a vision here
And niggas be selling their soul to go to a brunch
And niggas might end up sweet drinking that punch
I suffer good and niggas know Im from another hood
So keep your brotherhood Im tryna make sure that my mother good
I ask sheep but Im really goat to the goats
No matter with Top 5 Im the nigga quoted the most
Im the ghost of Wolf ghost of Rezar
I come with the facts you never consider Im a ghost of Shyne
I speak for every artist never spoke their mind
Representing every artist that was left behind
From Craig Mack to GDep
I still remember them kids trample
For every producer you every stole they sample
Why you playing with me Knowin I make examples
Niggas hide behind money you know thats not a man move
You know youre Frank and Im Tony
You know that itll get lonely its never safe when you owe me
You know the sayin true
You has a chance to do right I dont understand you
You cant stop a nigga came from Wick and Cam fool
But Karma came in getting hold of movers
You flow for the man causin Georgia may show his wrist and piss water
He could have made it right that nigga couldve saved his life
Now there aint now way to fight now he out there waving white
Ay know your strategy
Now what you have is being right now I got a mole in your faculty
So when you get the nerve to come after me what audacity
Gotta know the dollar sign wasnt rappin free
Actually after BIG died what a travesty
Cause when Mase left nigga wouldnt nobody after me
I guess I got the last laugh niggas aint laughing huh
Niggas stay strapping up Im ready for a massacre
Cam blackballed Mase the ball aint black enough
Tupac for us nigga I aint even mad at ya
Pretty nigga always make they hearts melt yeah
Guess you can say I know how Pac felt yeah
Im just a Harlem nigga reppin down a Vegas strip with my own Suge

Local niggas hatin but I cant blame em
Clear the road to the riches but I cant pave em

I dream about the way it would be
Mama had me playing on that classical piano
But that was not the music for me
I had my very first introduction
By singing in a local band
Ive got my rock and my roll instruction
Playing every club in the land
I made a deal with the angel of music
And I found what you said was true
If you give it to the people like the people want it
Theyll give it theyll give it
Theyll give it right back to you
I cant think of anything that I wouldnt do
As long as someone wants me to sing
You dont have to label me a Hollywood hero
Just let me do my righteous thing
Cos when the crowd theyre just waiting for you
And the lights they checkout okay
There aint no words to describe the feeling
That everybodys come to hear you play
Yes I will

And I learned what its all about

A bit of change for a woman thats what Im not having
I keep feelings inside I know who I am
Step to yourself cause I dont wanna hear it
I keep feelings inside I know who I am
Youre not getting younger youre just getting older
What do you get when you fall in love
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow

But then you broke my heart
Now youll try in vain to kiss back a dream
That no longer remains
Cause Im tired its true
Of what Im going through
Its better if were apart
After you put back the pieces
Ill still have a broken heart
In playing your games
You broke every promise
And then the heartaches came to us
Although youre tellin me
That youre so sorry
Then you hurt me from the start
After you put back the pieces

Oh yes I will
If my love you miss
Then always remember
That you started this
For a heart that is real
If once it is broken
It may never heal

With you its just an art I know

Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own

4185,"4th of July Asbury Park Sandy Lyrics
Sandy the fireworks are hailing over Little Eden tonight
Forcing a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July
Down in the town the Circuits full of switchblade lovers so fast so shiny so sharp
As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore
Chasing all them silly New York virgins by the score
And Sandy the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh love me tonight for I may never see you again
Hey Sandy girl
My my baby
Now the greasers ah they tramp the streets
Or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night
Them boys in their high heels ah Sandy
Their skins are so white
And me I just got tired of hanging in them dusty arcades banging them pleasure machines
Chasing the factory girls underneath the boardwalk
Where they all promise to unsnap their jeans
And you know that tiltawhirl down on the south beach drag
I got on it last night and my shirt got caught
And they kept me spinning babe didnt think Id ever get off
Oh Sandy the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life on the water
Running laughing neath the boardwalk
Ah with the boss daughter
I remember Sandy girl
Na na na na na baby
Sandy that waitress I was seeing lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night she said she wont set herself on fire for me anymore
She worked that joint under the boardwalk
She was always the girl you saw bopping down the beach with the radio
The kids say last night she was dressed like a star
In one of them cheap little seaside bars
And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie
For tellin fortunes better than they do
For me this boardwalk lifes through babe
You ought to quit this scene too
Sandy the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh love me tonight and I promise Ill love you forever
Oh I mean it Sandy girl
My my my my my baby
Yeah I promise Sandy girl
Sha la la la la baby

With a confident swagger international
Game so tight the girls had to go

Hah sicka than your average
Money too long cant stash it
In the closet or the mattress

Checks from advances the bank cant cash it
So the price for that never ask it
Just sign my name or pop plastic

Searching for a Glock in the pocket of his fashion
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses
And they left breast yes 
Lets get dressed and toast to the occasion

Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges

Po only know questions that was answered
Keep a number on the high price lawyer
Its foul ways nowadays everybody saw ya

Love comes walkin in
Some kind of alien

Then simply pulls a string
Another world some other time
You lay your sanity on the line

Reach back remember with all your might

With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Oh couldnt see to get a line on you my sweet honey love
Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you my sweet honey love
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
When youre drunk in the alley baby with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
Whoa just seemed too many flies on you
I just cant brush them off
Angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
Whoa thought I heard one sigh for you
Come on up come on up now come on up now

Man 2 Man shut the fuck up Whoa Slow down slow down slow down You see that brick house right there Thats the nigga crib When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up Ima get in the other car Aight
Car revs up
Gunshots
If theres beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
Ill ride by and blow ya brains out
Theres no time to cock it no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do I dont care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
Ill kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Catch you slipping Ima kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Keep thinking Im candy til ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain hop out the top like Jackinthebox
In the hood summer time is the killing season
Its hot out this bitch thats a good enough reason
Ive seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying Lord Jesus help me cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun till you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gon tear ya back up
Gods on ya side Shit Im aight with that
Cause we gon reload them clips and come right back
Its a fact homie you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look nigga dont think you safe cause you moved out the hood
Cause ya mama still around dawg and that aint good
If you was smart youd be shook of me
Cause I get tired of looking for ya
Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me

My heart bleeds for you nigga I cant wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes I can see the bitch in you
Nigga you know the streets talk
So therell be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
Im down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today Im happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts I done been in em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finna get shot it wont do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bonesll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh you a pro at playing Battleship Well this aint the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains
If theres beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
Ill ride by and blow ya brains out
Theres no time to cock it no way you can stop it

Catch you slipping Ima kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
After the fist fights its gunfire boy you get the best of me best of me 
If you dont wanna get shot I suggest you dont go testing me testing me 
All the wrong Ive done the Lord still keep on blessing me blessing me 
Finna run rap cause Dr Dre got the recipe recipe recipe 
Yeah ha ha aye Dre
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
Cause the windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof nigga
Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof nigga
Cause my motherfucking hat is bulletproof nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit I might get a fucking concussion
But better that than a hole in the head right nigga Ha ha ha ha

The Penis Song
Oh no he didnt  Honkey dick 
This is my penis song
I wish that I had a bigger shlong
One that was quite a bit more thick and way more long
One of those porno king kong dongs
Haha check it out yo uh
I wish my dick was bigger yep I can admit it
Im above average on inches but I wanted damn double digits
If I had a big ol cock what would I do
Id probably go to Florida and show it to Trina and screw
Get butt naked and start streaking at my school
And get arrested but at least the girls would be impressed
With my third leg and and then Id go to a keg and
Do a keg stand get drunk and do the running man
With no clothes on just to show off
My dicks bigger than yours when mine is cold and soft
Haha oh yeah
I forgot thats not really the cock that I have
I went out and partybagged em and quickly opened the package
And it fit me like Kriss Krosss old school starter jackets
Tryna convince myself like Size doesnt matter
Anyways Id probably just put it on backwards I mean
I know that God made us all different and special
But shit did he really have to invent lopsided testicles
I dont have them I just I feel bad for like you know the guys with like you know their left one hangs like lower than the right one kinda like akinda like a lazy eye like on your on your balls I donI dont know I just just heard that I feel bad
This is my penis song

Fellas if yall feel me sing along Dont front dont front 


Yo yo yo Ayo ladies Yeah Ladies Yeah Do you want a guy with an average dick Hell no Thenwait you dont No honkey dick Okay thats cool Whatever No thats fine
I promise Im so self conscious
Thats why you never see me skinny dippin in August
Always walkin around with my hands in my pockets
Tryna pump blood into my guy Alfonso
I mean goddamn I dont think you girls understand
Ive had a complex since that song Short Short Man
And even though girls have told me that Im big
When I watch a porno I feel like a little kid
I mean lets take Ron Jeremy
Now if a girl sees him shell compare him to me
And every MC in hiphop has got a huge cock
Or at least talks about it in every song that they drop
I mean shit
If I was really hung Id make a whole album called Me and My Dick
With interludes of all the girls that Id been with
And talk about my package and multiple orgasms
Cause all that I see is that size does matter
We got Enzite penis pumps surgery to Viagra
But when it all adds up you cant really change it
Im not a porno star I just gotta face it
You know I mean what can I do Nothing right This song goes out to like all the like little bit above average dudes to like the small dudes medium dudes but all you big guys man stop 
This is my penis song

5572,"I mean Sometimes I see things I guess cause Im a ghost I see ghostly things
Thought I saw something that wasnt there but it was there
Theyre as far as the eye can see
as far as I can see though 
There are shadows haunting me
I see shadows 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
and Im looking real far even if Im asleep 
There are shadows haunting me
aint that something 
Something in the shadows
Maybe its the Pharaohs
Coming to spread the light cause the visions so narrow
Maybe its the killas in the cut with the barrels
Getting high but cant fly without the eye of a sparrow
Fatigued and fatigue ready for battle
My word could move herd like the cattle
Try to stay hard lifes fragile meaning you could lose any moment
My cranium is like Damiens no Omen
I dont bare the mark of the beast
Just the heart of the beast
Rally for em when its dark in the streets
Just a ice cold nigga that be sparking the heat
Tryna make it through the struggle just to say at the least
If they coming tell em come now
Sunset sundown
I dont put my gun down
And I aint tryna run clown
I keep something in the barrels
Fully loaded up knowing theres something in the shadows
Theyre as far as the eye can see
Point blank period get high and hallucinate 
There are shadows haunting me
Stress is building up 
Theyre as far as the eye can see
I smell murder every time that the wind blows 
There are shadows haunting me
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling 


Something in the shadows maybe its the reaper
Maybe its the devil trying to put me in the sleeper
Maybe its God trying to tell me that Im deeper
Ill know soon have faith in a goon
I broke date mad years trying to race with the moon
If the sun give me energy
Why I pull my gun on my enemies
And wait for nightfall to drink Hennessy
Cups of Courvoisier times the same on this Swatch
Or Cartier unless you set your watch different
We got eyes but our watch different
Be on the block different
Be on the low in the spot different
I got bars but the Glock kicking
Im in tune with the moon
And the wolves that howl at it
You could play the game if you foul at it
Tell the pigs its a fair game
I get high and kick my Nike Airs off in first class on the airplane
I wont rest til the day I see the angel of death
And tell him wish me the best
If I dont get it this life may I get it the next
Never settle for less
Street niggas say I did it the best which is true though
Coke since the days of Menudo
Higher than Pluto
Something in the shadows but I aint got a clue though I got no clue 
Im getting drunk off the booze
Im getting high just recording with Poose
Have dreams about the Lord and his crew
Or the devil and his boys
I have voices in my head but I can never make the noise stop cant stop can it 
They always singing on a carol
Far as they can see know theres something in the shadows
",shadows maybe its the reaper Maybe its the devil trying to put me in the sleeper Maybe its God trying to tell me that Im deeper Ill know soon have faith in a goon I broke date mad years trying to race with the moon If the sun give me energy Why I pull my gun on my enemies And wait for nightfall to drink Hennessy Cups of Courvoisier times the same on this Swatch Or Cartier unless you set your watch different We got eyes but our watch different Be on the block different Be on the low in the spot different I got bars but the Glock kicking Im in tune with the moon And the wolves that howl at it You could play the game if you foul at it Tell the pigs its a fair game I get high and kick my Nike Airs off in first class on the airplane I wont rest til the day I see the angel of death And tell him wish me the best If I dont get it this life may I get it the next Never settle for less Street niggas say I did it the best which is true though Coke since the days of Menudo Higher than Pluto Something in the shadows but I aint got a clue though I got no clue Im getting drunk off the booze Im getting high just recording with Poose Have dreams about the Lord and his crew Or the devil and his boys I have voices in my head but I can never make the noise stop cant stop can it They always singing on a carol Far as they can see know theres something in the shadows,I mean Sometimes I see things I guess cause Im a ghost I see ghostly things Thought I saw something that wasnt there but it was there Theyre as far as the eye can see as far as I can see though There are shadows haunting me I see shadows Theyre as far as the eye can see and Im looking real far even if Im asleep There are shadows haunting me aint that something Something in the shadows Maybe its the Pharaohs Coming to spread the light cause the visions so narrow Maybe its the killas in the cut with the barrels Getting high but cant fly without the eye of a sparrow Fatigued and fatigue ready for battle My word could move herd like the cattle Try to stay hard lifes fragile meaning you could lose any moment My cranium is like Damiens no Omen I dont bare the mark of the beast Just the heart of the beast Rally for em when its dark in the streets Just a ice cold nigga that be sparking the heat Tryna make it through the struggle just to say at the least If they coming tell em come now Sunset sundown I dont put my gun down And I aint tryna run clown I keep something in the barrels Fully loaded up knowing theres something in the shadows Theyre as far as the eye can see Point blank period get high and hallucinate There are shadows haunting me Stress is building up Theyre as far as the eye can see I smell murder every time that the wind blows There are shadows haunting me I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling Something in the
7967,"Say this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred
CL Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met we wasnt on the same page
From petty misunderstandings that got clearer with age
Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put PA on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Bigtyme put down a few songs
Everybody cosigned saying that we could do no wrong
Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped Tell Me Something Good took off and went live
Shit next thing you know we was signing to Jive
Dropped Too Hard to Swallow A Pocket Full of Stones
Put the remix on Menace shit we had it going on
Got love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out wasnt playing too fair
Had to separate ourself bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side aint always what it seems
We dropped Super Tight a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes
We didnt realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice
Took a while to catch on to what homey was doing
But by the time we did all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldnt file taxes
The next thing you know IRS hitting us with axes
Pimp you owe seven figures Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM almost got put on the shelf
Fuck it dropped Ridin Dirty instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title shut everybodys mouth
Got some clout in the game boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters
The old manager calling and say he fina sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets and we cant keep the people waiting
He made a call or two to some folks tellin em man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan Bun got the drawl
RapALot had our back and we just waiting on Jive
We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the NY
Its JayZ saying yall niggas getting fly
He doing Volume 3 and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggas rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it but Pimp wasnt sure
But Big Pimpin hit em 187Pure
Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated cant believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded
And it stated that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and well be on the way
Shit it sounded okay but me I had to ask
If we dont do Big Pimpin 2 would you still put us on blast
A song like that would might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base might think a nigga flop
They got mad and put niggas on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix
We put Dirty Money together and it was aces
But thats around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation said fuck you hoes
We finish the album got ready to do a couple shows
And then he violated one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done we back to the nitty gritty
Album got released big showdown in Chocolate City
Niggas with masks on vests and all black
Its Christmas 2001 bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block nobody could budge
And then he violated now we right back before the judge
They calling him a nuisance put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th he aint been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
In stead of coCEO now Im the fuckin boss
Had the devil on my back got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please
Let me get past this bridge over water thats trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son dont worry
Cause its not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams
You just got to stay true to yourself and to C
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before Im breaking em G
Not to mention I got the world screaming Free Pimp C
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You aint gotta worry about nothing the world is yours
Aint no mo struggles my nigga and no mo strife
I kept it real because to me its UGK for life
",him Shit big Bun was all for it but Pimp wasnt sure But Big Pimpin hit em 187Pure Number one song on every station you turn on MTV and BET we getting our burn on Grammy nominated cant believe that

Down to the garden took a little dip Oh no 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Lil sip took a lil sip
Took a lil sip ttook a lil took a lil took a lil sip
Ayo I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold techs like they mad at the ref
Thats why I keep a cross on my chest either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit watch for the Adams apple
Slick with words dont hate me son
What you eat dont make me shit and who you fuck dont make me cum
Put a price on my head wont make me run
Try to kill me but it cant be done
Cause my words gon live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Me and my bitch took a little trip

Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making As at 11
Or 12 trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell only time gon tell
Fuck her while her mama home baby dont yell
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader fuck your magazine hater
When I say that Im the greatest I aint talking about later
Ima drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wany
And I dont mean no disrespect I praise legends
But this whats next the boy sick cant disinfect
Lifes a bitch and her pussys wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of death

2839,"When I first saw your gallery I liked the ones of ladies
Then you began to hang up me you studied to portray me
In ice and greens and old blue jeans and naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes that all your work discloses
Lady dont love me now I am dead
I am a saint turn down your bed
I have no heart thats what you said
You said I can be cruel but let me be gentle with you
Somewhere in a magazine I found a page about you
I see that now its Josephine who cannot be without you
I keep your house in fit repair I dust the portraits daily
Your mail comes here from everywhere the writing looks like ladies
Lady please love me now I am dead
I am a saint turn down your bed
I have no heart thats what you said
You said I can be cruel but let me be gentle with you
I gave you all my pretty years then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here while you went west for pleasure
And now youre flying back this way like some lost homing pigeon
Theyve monitored your brain you say and changed you with religion
Lady please love me now I was dead

Well I can be cruel but let me be gentle with you
When I first saw your gallery I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me and all their eyes look shady

6504,"You was playin when you was sayin you was ready
Im knowin you aint mean it when you told me you was tired of life
And just wanted to leave it you was drinkin
So I aint really pay it no attention
Took you back to your crib and dropped you off
With the intention of gettin with this Asian bitch
Ive been off in Visionz somethin exquisite
I had to spit that game she was vicious
Im hoppin back on 610 punchin the drop
On my way out to her house I started noticing cops
Somethin tellin me to turn around and follow these dudes
Normally I wouldnt consider but out of the blue Im bustin a U
I get off where they get off at
Wellfamiliar with these streets this where I came up at
Roadblocks yellow tape a crime scene they say
What the fuck just happened I just left this place
I get out and started walkin askin Frog Whats up
Lookin at me dazed like Face its all fucked up
I move a little closer tryin to see who it is
And I saw his baby mama in tears holdin his kids
I aint whole in the inside Im hurting I cant explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies Im knowing this aint how my lifes supposed to be
And it was then it finally hit me
Im standing here nervous as I can be
It was nothing that can prepare me for what Im finna see
Im praying this is a dream and Im bout to awake
But the closer I got the more I realize fate
Wasnt fair to change for me
And why would I think so
My homie had a date with death
He had to make though
Im feelin eerie Im liftin up the yellow tape
By the time I get to the scene
They rollin this away
I wonder whats under this sheet my knees get weak
To the point I had to take me a seat
This shits deep
When they put a nigga down that you was raised around
What was once a minor statements turnin major now
Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal
Had it all money and kids and a wife that read the bible
They say its life and death in the tongue
He had his reasons I shoulda believed him
Anotha soul no longer breathin
Hate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience
My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense


I aint whole in the inside Im hurting I cant explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies Im knowing this aint how my lifes supposed to be
And everybody thinkin its murder but homicide sayin selfinflicted
By the way the body was sitting brains in the kitchen
Who coulda predicted
But the detectives who was fishin
Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position
All I remember was us doin what we did
To survive in these streets where we lived
We was kids growin up in this environment
Nothing but trouble
You either struggled or you hustled
Folded the bubble
Grade school til we dropped out we had a plan
We was either finna be rich or die like a man
We did it all for the love of the hood every journey
Imagine seein your dawg lifeless across a gurney
I wonder what was goin on
You shoulda said that you was feelin mad
I coulda talked you outta that
But never will I see you again
Nor will your kids
Nor will your family or your friends
Its the end
Not even words I write in this song
Can right that wrong
My nigga is gone and life goes on
I aint whole in the inside Im hurting I cant explain whats going on in me
Stop it now with all the lies Im knowing this aint how my lifes supposed to be",to take me a seat This shits deep When they put a nigga down that you was raised around What was once a minor statements turnin major now Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal Had it all money and kids and a wife that read the bible They say its life and death in the tongue He had his reasons I shoulda believed him Anotha soul no longer breathin Hate to say it but this one been heavy on my conscience My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense I aint whole in the inside Im hurting I cant explain whats going on in me Stop it now with all the lies Im knowing this aint how my lifes supposed to be And everybody thinkin its murder but homicide sayin selfinflicted By the way the body was sitting brains in the kitchen Who coulda predicted But the detectives who was fishin Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position All I remember was us doin what we did To survive in these streets where we lived We was kids growin up in this environment Nothing but trouble You either struggled or you hustled Folded the bubble Grade school til we dropped out we had a plan We was either finna be rich or die like a man We did it all for the love of the hood every journey Imagine seein your dawg lifeless across a gurney I wonder what was goin on You shoulda said that you was feelin mad I coulda talked you outta that But never will I see you again Nor will your kids Nor will your family or your friends Its the end Not even words I write in this song Can right that wrong My nigga is gone and life goes on I aint whole in the inside Im hurting I cant explain whats going on in me Stop it now with all the lies Im knowing this aint how my lifes supposed to be,You was playin when you was sayin you was ready Im knowin you aint mean it when you told me you was tired of life And just wanted to leave it you was drinkin So I aint really pay it no attention Took you back to your crib and dropped you off With the intention of gettin with this Asian bitch Ive been off in Visionz somethin exquisite I had to spit that game she was vicious Im hoppin back on 610 punchin the drop On my way out to her house I started noticing cops Somethin tellin me to turn around and follow these dudes Normally I wouldnt consider but out of the blue Im bustin a U I get off where they get off at Wellfamiliar with these streets this where I came up at Roadblocks yellow tape a crime scene they say What the fuck just happened I just left this place I get out and started walkin askin Frog Whats up Lookin at me dazed like Face its all fucked up I move a little closer tryin to see who it is And I saw his baby mama in tears holdin his kids I aint whole in the inside Im hurting I cant explain whats going on in me Stop it now with all the lies Im knowing this aint how my lifes supposed to be And it was then it finally hit me Im standing here nervous as I can be It was nothing that can prepare me for what Im finna see Im praying this is a dream and Im bout to awake But the closer I got the more I realize fate Wasnt fair to change for me And why would I think so My homie had a date with death He had to make though Im feelin eerie Im liftin up the yellow tape By the time I get to the scene They rollin this away I wonder whats under this sheet my knees get weak To the point I had

We aint together no more I guess we was just too young
To even try to start a family in the first place
But I get happy every time I look into his face
Ever since you went away man its been hard for me
Didnt know til you died how much you meant to me
All the time and the patience you put into me
You showed me how to be the man that I was meant to be
Taught me how to play music and bout the melody
And to this day I remember what you was tellin me
You told me Son most of this rap shit is just noise
But if you put some music in it youll get rich boy
Thats why I stay up in the studio up all night
I fuck with live musicians to get the groove right

But he aint the only one cause Annie I miss you too

Tell me why black life isnt life unless theres prison in it
General population of super cell or Johnny or some Jack Man
Powdered coffee peppermint peach cool offs but a paint I wish I had that
And even more than my freedom I wish I had somethin else
I would give back everything Ive accomplished fore this one thang and nothin else
I aint talkin about a relationship cause broads bring too much drama drama 
Id even pass the chance to be a millionaire if I could hug and kiss my momma momma 
I remember like it was yesterday although I was six years old
Momma whats wrong wake up wake up Why yo forehead hot and yo hands so cold

Tellin me everythang was alright but they was sad and cryin and shit
Aint that a bitch My momma aint never came back I wish I could hug and kiss her

Im tryna let you know what the fuck that Ive been through
Two feet in the red dirt school skirt
Sugar cane back lanes
Three jobs took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But dont know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy first deal changed me
Robbed blind basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at em
And even the score
So I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning

Hate to be inconsiderate

And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
And well wear it till the night comes
Woke up it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Blue red green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
Theres a sun show every second
Now the curtain opens
On a portait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away
Woke up it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
And well talk in present tenses
When the curtain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewellight
If only you will stay
Pretty baby wont you

5383,"Ho ho hon when you think on Christmas it be snowin
And people get their equal hit the full one one for growin
Ya knowin were flowin in the ghetto they get nothing
No toys for little boys no curls for girls and turkey stuffing
They laugh they know that half the presents aint thick
You might just wanna ask Yo where my presents Saint Nick
So think a little bout the people minus money
And when you get your dough why dont you show some kindness honey
Go head get fed and spread a little love
Give what you can afford just like The Lord from up above
A quote a note and one you wont believe
Its better to give than to receive
YO Its Christmas no dissin listen all you listeners
Think of all the prisoners thats in prison during Christmas
Not tryin to bring you down but tryin to put you up on
Landed it on the table so youre able to put your cup on
No snow not a flurry so hurry dont you miss it
Not dissin you but whishin you a very merry Christmas
Give up the dough Give up the dough
Give up the dough on Christmas YO
Give up the dough Give up the dough
Give up the dough HERE WE GO HERE WE GO

No toys or presents beneath my tree
I wrote my list I made my wish
Is this what Christmas means to me
No snowflakes droppin cant go shoppin
Rhymes Im apoppin to keep the hiphhoppin
Why cant a Santa Pause for the cause
Im gettin mine you gettin yours
Thats how Christmas is supposed to be
A very merry Christmas for everybodyy
Fight poverty give to the needy
Dont be like The Grinch cause The Grinch is greedy
Deck the malls with bows of holly
Tis the season to be jolly
No presents for my tree yet
And I dont even know if any gifts Im gonna get
Happy holidays not like a lotta days
A few here a few there a new year
Season greetings are the reasons for the cheer
If Santa Claus is coming to town
Hope its my chimney hes coming down
On Christmas because Christmas is
On Christmas because Christmas is
HERRRRE WE GO FLOW 
Hahave a very merry merry and hurry
And if youll need a leader Runll be there for your flurry
Blurry sight and write a rhyme for the night
Christmas is the time for giving not for the type
So open your pockets your heart unlock it
Dollars train from Hollis I give it like I clock it
Cold as the weather minus the humidity
Dont mistake harmonies and kindness for timidity
Christmas this must be the time of year
Leggo of your Eggo rather ego me go there
And here my dear so give a kid a beer
Cause every time you give its coming back lets get it clear
Ill be scopin and hopin brothers lend a ear
So have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

I want my Sega Genesis I want my Nintendo

2285,"First thing I remember was asking papa Why
For there were many things I didnt know
And Daddy always smiled took me by the hand
Saying someday youll understand
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son
Youd better learn it fast youd better learn it young
Cause someday never comes
The time and tears went by and I collected dust
For there were many things I didnt know
When Daddy went away he said try to be a man
And someday youll understand
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son
Youd better learn it fast youd better learn it young
Cause someday never comes
And then one day in April I wasnt even there
For there were many things I didnt know
A son was born to me mama held his hand

5834,"Something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects man
And thats how we roll roll
You know Im well known like Al Capone fully blown like Ton Montana
In a zone sittin on chrome stoned sippin on champagna
Rollin ganja up in Bible paper see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ John Elijah Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream bustin out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard deemer medallion
Mockin God even Italians see my battalion propped abroad
I got the Squad overqualified pullin over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted threewheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you
Theres something Ive been thinking that your crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And thats how we roll roll
I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat
What you broke motherfuckers know about that
Lookin fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly blown Benz chrome rims 
Shinin like the stone gems on my gold rings 
I got it sewn Twinz I cant begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
Ive been a killer and a drug dealer a bugged nigga
But now Im like Puffy cause moneys thicker than blood player
Im still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together and figure which cleaners the best for the hit
I get the job done Puns handlin business
Candlelight dinners havin a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses so expensive my whole familys religious

Long as my crews official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
Im tryna triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God FullAClips and myself thatll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
Im on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin
Im infinite like math so Im gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day bullshit and sittin on your ass
Im all about cash and the power
A stash with the powder that lasts like hittin ass for an hour
Lets get it locked I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops we got Deserts and Glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryna stop our cheddar from stockin forever
Ooohooo baby theres something I want to tell you

6873,"Straight Outta Compton Extended Mix Lyrics
Niggas Wit Attitudes
Niggas Wit Attitudes
Niggas Wit Attitudes
Im comin straight outta Compton
When somethin happens in South Central Los Angeles
Nothin happens Its just another nigga dead dead 
Straight outta Compton crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When Im called off I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass thats how Im goin out
For the punk motherfuckers thats showin out
Niggas start to mumble they wanna rumble
Mix them and cook them in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherfucker like that
With a gat thats pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Aint no tellin when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep you dancin
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK47 is the tool
Dont make me act the motherfuckin fool
Me you can go toe to toe no maybe
Im knockin niggas out the box daily
Yo weekly monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That Im down with the capital CPT
Boy you cant fuck with me
So when Im in your neighbourhood you better duck
Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave believe Im stompin
But when I come back boy Im comin straight outta Compton
Yall aoh aoh
City of Compton
City of Compton
Yo Ren
Whats up
Tell them where you from
Straight outta Compton another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke yo my rep gets bigger
Im a bad motherfucker and you know this
But the pussy ass niggas wont show this
But I dont give a fuck Ima make my snaps
If not from the records from jackin the crops
Just like burglary the definition is jackin
And when Im illegally armed its called packin
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy I go up in it
So if youre at a show in the front row
Ima call you a bitch or dirtyass ho
Youll probably get mad like them bitches are posed to
But that shows me slut youre composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit cause Im tearin up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and thats a law
REN spells Ren but Im raw
See cause Im the motherfuckin Villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killin
Thats takin place without a clue
And once youre on the scope your ass is through
Look you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip
Straight outta Compton
City of Compton
City of Compton
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton is a brother thatll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont give a fuck thats the problem
I see a motherfuckin cop I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see a punk pass I smile
To me its kind of funny the attitudes showin a nigga drivin
But dont know where the fuck he goin just rollin
Lookin for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload you see its about to over the hesitation
And hears the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and Im jettin
But leave a memory no onell be forgettin
So what about the bitch who got shot Fuck her
You think I give a damn about a bitch I aint a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E and if you ever fuck with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
Word to the motherfucker straight outta Compton
City of Compton
City of Compton

To find my space and satisfy you too

Still youd turn away

Kato 808 in my rhymes the Green Hornet
At times I lean on it yall just fiend on it
Im cold fronting throughout the metro
Piloting baby the globe is my area
Yeah the most feared villain in America
Toss the trigger I use to hit the sheriff up
Now Im convincing these dudes to get their lyrics up
Yall niggas bull too much yall niggas said enough
Sickin competitors heavily stressing this with ya
My medicine Yall finna go see the therapist
I gotta settle it black metal to metal
With these brothers on that bullshit pot calling the kettle crisp
What could be better bitch Im rocking the flag with the green black and red
And youre on the confederate boy you work for Merill Lynch
Yall aint fucking with a brother hell bent on success Im living evidence
See its really all about sensation and the fascination
We got to chase it dreams
Im trying to be the champ youre in to racing
Cause fuck wasting time on the consolation prize
Something undetectable to yall naked eyes
Still its probably more real than yall recognize
I specialize in raw carnivorous rhyming
Better silence it yall you couldnt size it
The fourth horseman give rise over the blade
Its going to cut you to a different size
In the days of guerrilla warfare
Making a change like carfare
I want these chumps taken off here
Sip my morning coffee kiss my baby girl
Tell my lady friend Im gone until I save the world
Jump in my hotrod wheel looking super thorough
Rocking an all black cape like the Duke of Earl
The essence of a movement on some smooth shit
Langston Hughes mixed in with some Stanley Kubrick
Sick still yet Im savvy penning a nasty masterpiece
That convey my sentiment exactly
Black Im that nice son from Michaelango or Michael Eric Dyson
Slicing like a viking dog Im white lightning
Im caught with a bone with a slight tick in my mind
Its tight frightening
The flow is part Mozart and part Malcom
Clearly you aint fearing you already know the outcome
Another victory were making history
Im stronger than the walls in the penitentiary

My heart made of stone I guess you can say frozen
So leave me alone Im unbroken outspoken
I stand by my word cause its golden
Out here in the Pacific Ocean West Coastin
Dont let a ho make us enemies Enemies 
Were family just like the Genovese Genovese 
Stick to the script we dont do sucka shit

Trademarks and entities no I aint sellin keys

Dressed like a boss but I rap like Im broke
You off of parole then make sure that you vote

Might pose for the gram with my money phone
Turn my bands to a fan like Im hella young
Take a picture with money all down my arm
Just to show we the same although Im reformed
Diamonds yellow like kettle corn

7277,"I got some skeletons locked in the closet Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
I look over my shoulder not knowing where its comin from
But knowing that its coming I was bugging as a youngin
Now Im runnin from something thatll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
Do any sins go unforgiven I hope not
Cause most of mine were hunger driven nothing in my mothers kitchen
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hittin
So the wellscrewed kid ended up with more than a couple missin
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cookin
I love kids but now Im selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and I dont give a fuck is my plan
Youll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I aint find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing
Cause aint no way in hell this aint Joell thats brave enough to tell you everything
I got some skeletons locked in the closet Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
Fuck all that rappin Ima let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka Ima take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yo thanks a lot Im a bottledrinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Aint nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
Thats when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked Is youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real bro
I got some skeletons locked in the closet Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it Yeah yeah 
Wishing maybe itll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it
I thought I had it all locked away til forever
But no memories fade away they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then whys the pain still with me
Uh
See the problem is I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really theres no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed Im much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 247 dog thats my department
Inter city blues cruise and Im blasting that Marvin
Skeletons aint in my closet thats my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
Its all bleak to me tell my Pop I aint bothered
When he dont speak to me I love you but its weak to me
On one hand life is short and theres no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog Im kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam judge but you dont understand
Me against the world I plan on winning know Im undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here just take care of half the rent
I got some skeletons locked in the closet Yeah yeah 
And Ive been dyin dyin just to find an outlet Yeah 
And Im hoping that no one finds out about it Yeah yeah

2214,"A girl named Mary dreamed of being in love
Gathering water by a lonely road
An angel came and whispered very low
You are the one that our God has chose
To have the Savior as it was told
To many prophets so long ago
And then he placed his hand upon her there
And she knew then the Savior she would bear
At Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
He rendered her a name that none would share
Except when faithfully kneeling in prayer
And she furrowed and said the name of Christ
And knew the dream would happen in life
At Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
Oh you know its Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
To Joseph she exclaimed in truth that night
Of how the angel came with all his light
And soon they went and traveled to the place
Where one bright star would show where his head laid
When all men came from near and afar
To honor glory to the Son of God
And in the manger quietly he lay
Wise men and shepherds knelt by him to pray
Its Christmastime
Oh Christmastime
Oh I said its Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born

Exciteting enlightning inviteing
Im writing shit that I feel
Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion
The motion of Com is like that of a ocean
Devotion cause Im the Earth Wind and Fire of hiphop
By Rakim and Short Ive been inspired
My shit knocks environments of cats with seventeens
Tint time is money the mind is funny how its spent on getting it
Im sitting with descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is money cash hoes
I went from bashful to asshole to international lover of self
Word to the mother on my last record cover its felt
Now deal with it
I wanna get into it
Lets do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So lets just get into it
Lets do this
Can you feel the music
The music oh ah can you feel the music the music
In this neverending battle to please
Niggas magazine writers emcees
Who request hot shit I freeze
And tell them where I was rose we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This neverwentgold nigga rocks shows caratless
You not gon respect self at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day I gotta carry this
And beats rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking RB broads it came true
Journalist I wreck shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice come to find out the angel was me
Some say You changing Rashid
Times are we still close
I rhyme far away away away
From what you accustomed to hearing everyday uhah
You know the dopechoppin gunpoppin homies dying
Im amongst it save the war stories for Private Ryan INI
I wanna get into it
Lets do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So lets just get into it
Lets do this
Can you feel the music
The music oh ah can you feel the music the music
Women cry children laugh men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans
Over weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprahs
My refrigerator poetrys magnetic like ultra
You couldnt hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
Its rumors of gay emcees just dont come around me with it
You still rockin hickies dont let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs of Mary J Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat lost weight but I still rap husky
My verse depth is that of a babys first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when its time to head home
I wanna get into it
Lets do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it

3374,"I have witnessed your death
Ive seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrepit little mind
A fathers son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die again for Him
God wont touch what Ive done
He cries upon my feet
A privileged pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged in fear
Await the coming of the God
I will watch you die again for Him
Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquer divide within
Terrorize the mind
Ive seen the end its yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh it melts
Spilling from the sky
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die
This is Gods war
Gods war
This is Gods war
Gods war
War of holy principles
Im seeking Gods help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heathen man
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead
Fuck your God erase his name
A lady weeps insane with sorrow
Ill take his towers from the world
Youre fuckin raped upon your deathbed
This is Gods war
Gods war
This is Gods war
Gods war
Fucking holy war
Be optimistic happy and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors
Your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For its a point of no return for Almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servants
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy
The great Satan

Do you like this style of rap that Im showin you
The way I flow for you do you know
Yeah baby cmon
Ah baby baby cmon check the rhyme to the song
Uhh aw yeah baby cmon
Ah baby baby cmon and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four gotta keep em on the floor
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What Im used to hearin I cant believe its gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King the beef is on
When I come rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices weak in the knees
So run for your lives Kane with the pen
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills come see how it feels
I pull you one verse if that dont kill I got refills
You cant do me none kid you gets nothin
If my rhymes was in Braille you still couldnt touch em
Man Im a bad cat my style of rap is mad fat
And you know sometimes its so sad that
Rappers today be comin as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft they wouldnt even kill time right
Heres the news you lettin the word hardcore be misused
You aint never paid dues
Be for real you aint tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmn sham
Im glad in this business I didnt forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
Never to walk in anyones shadow
I do my own thing I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
That battles I dont lose none boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die choose one
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin sex the way that I put it in em
And do I crush MCs are you kiddin me
If rappers were grapes Id have a whole wine distillery
So I bring it to your face with the bass then I blow
A rapper off the map with the rap when I flow
Then hit you with the skill that is ill and I know
That all of this is good to go cause yo
Thats the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum
The Brooklyn style cause that is where Im from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track just like that
Amazin the people the style of the rappin is quite fat
Im lickin the lyrics and shootin the gat on the mic black
And this is for all of the rappers that like and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan
Cause all the ladies Im givin em lots of love
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick even the slimmy ones
Watch out Goldie Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
And none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
With skills to pay the bills to make more stacks than
Taller than anybody elses stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers dont believe the magazine rumors
Cause Kane is makin a comeback like Pumas
I get rough G and set it on your whole damn company
And Bogart like my name was Humphrey
When I get through therell be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt I should open a crematorium
I make mad MCs give me my Ps
If you try to disrespect kid you can get these
NUTs like the UNVs
I leave you down on your knees down on your kneehees
Razor sharp many ways of art
Source rings the chart people praise the God
For kickin the flows so fantastic and this one here
Were callin it Lyrical Gymnastics

2036,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you big river
And Im gonna sit right here until I die
I met her accidentally in St Paul Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you big river when you called
Then you took me to St Louis later on down the river
A freighter said shes been here but shes gone boy shes gone
I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone
Now wont you batter down by Baton Rouge River Queen roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans New Orleans
Go on Ive had enough dump my blues down in the Gulf
She loves you big river more than me
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry cry cry

7677,"Raw Remix Lyrics
Here it comes
Since the faroff days when man first heard a scratchy noise
On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones
It has been his aim to add breadth and depth to give realism
And spaciousness and even where it applies to convey actual movement
Intro I start to go my rhymesll flow
So get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you were lounging around its time to get up
Pardon my expression but Imma tear shit up
I appear right here and scare and dare a mere musketeer
That would dare to compare I do declare
Getting busy is where its at
But what youre saying you wouldnt get a point for that
Cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat
You say youre rocking how many shows you get
All your vocals go local on the MIC
Mines go a great distance like ATT
Im not new to this Im true to this nothing you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So yo go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse
Get you a nurse too late get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct I get respect Im out to collect
Cash money cause I get raw
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Boy do I hate a
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Im coming
Here I am RAW
A terrorist here to bring trouble to
Phony MCs I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause Im at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter Im a kilo
Second to none making MCs run
So dont try to step to me cause I aint the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it so I dont see why you all
Try to front perpetrating a stunt
When you know that Ill smoke you up like a blunt
Im genuine like Gucci raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the AM
Ill make a muscle grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed I bust a
Little rhyme with authority superiority
And captivate the whole crowds majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty or Hill Street Blues
Im sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Give a speech like a reverend rappers start severing
And in my lifetime believe Ive never been
Beaten or eaten and just tooken out
You know come to think about it I keep MCs looking out
And real nervous when Im at your service
Give me that title boy you dont deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme you know that it has to
Be perfectly fitted cause Im committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kanell get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know
I damage ya Im not an amateur but a pro
fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
So full of action my name should be a verb
My voice will float on every note
When I clear my throat thats all she wrote
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe its gonna be smooth sailing so on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get them in a battle and make them all history
Ruling and schooling MCs that Im dueling
Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling
On my throne with a bronze microphone
Hmm God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause I get raw
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Aint it good to you
Heres an experiment to begin with
Twentyfour sev chilling killing like a villain
The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever take a loss never
And the rhymes I bust coming off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
Only crushing MCs that be trying to riff
I get strong and titanic do work like a mechanic
Make MCs panic they all get frantic
And skeptic like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rock but hey what you expected
Ill get raw for you just like a warrior
Rapping like a samurai and Ill be damned if I
Ever let a FisherPrice MC hang
Their rhymes are toy nothing but yinyang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And Imma preach your funeral
Tell me who in the world could ever come with more
I get raw

Just let me be great
Let me be great
I feel like mothafuckin Cassius Clay right now
Genius
Dont be good my nigga be great
After that government cheese we eating steak
After the projects now we on estates
Im from the bottom I know you can relate
Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream Hov got a team
My chain already heavy dont let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush confetti on my fur
Turn right in Rutland niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
Im just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1 of a billion more than niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like its an everyday thing clean
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the uhh
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the lowlow
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murdered Malcolm gave Cassius the shakes
Wait tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know Im gon shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy basking on top
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Lets fuck up the world
Fuck up the uhh
Sipping DUSS boy this aint your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac me Im in the Maybach
This aint grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got strip clubs feeling like Oxford I swear
Teacherteacher Im trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught yall they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere you in the HOVs
Jordan 1s and dungarees
And thats just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
til we all check a billion shit its just the way Im feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling we just top what we top
Cause the bars dont struggle when the struggle dont stop
Just fuck up this world

With a trace of misty mornin
And a promise of tomorrow in her eyes

For more than just a day

When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove

6580,"Keep On Keepin On Remix Lyrics
Remix check it out
Bboy where the fuck you at
I been looking for youre ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter baby come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer thats when you had enougha
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
Youre getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby down this Mimosa
You better believe its time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade too bad to be played
Get vexed and Im bound to throw shade
All over your body
Whos body your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life aint all that unless youre doing it right
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Beware of the stare when I step the piece
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
Ayes I can can or why not
If I wanna yes I can can
More honey than a bumblebee hive
Pulling sixtynine ways out my archive
Sweet like licorice sugar for my booga
Juicy like HiC or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I aint afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Ven aqui and Ill get rid of all company
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
A love brand new
Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didnt perform well
They gets no answer when they ringaringa my bell
Youre playing with my time trying to jerk me
Hurt me then desert me you better work me
While you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the LYTE
Only the strong survive only the wise excel
Once said by my borninhell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info of my sheets in the streets
Cause that aint cool and that aint cute
To talk about who knocked the boot on a video shoot
But its all good though you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey make your move and hop up on it
Its natural never be ashamed
Fuck the fame get the name and kick the game
All you gotta do is Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world
Keep on keepin on
You came and you changed my world

Its one oclock and time for lunch
Bumdedum dedum
When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk
Theres always been Ethel
Jacob wake up youve got to tidy your room now
And then Mister Lewis
Isnt it time that he was out on his own
Over the garden wall two little lovebirds cuckoo to you
Keep them mowing blades sharp
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show your show
Dada dadada
Dada dadada

Sunday night Mr Farmer called
Said Listen son youre wasting time
Theres a future for you in the fire escape trade
Come up to town
But I remembered the voice from the past
Gambling only pays when youre winning
I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure
Keep them mowing blades sharp
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show yeah
I know what I like
And I like what I know

6993,"Yo this joint right here is dedicated to all them grimy cats
Thatll stab you in the back nah mean
Disloyal ass niggas all in your business
Snake in the grass ass hoes peeped your stash
You aint goin nowhere snake
See you check it
I hate a nigga all up in your business
Tryin to finally confine about you yo what is this
Damn nigga do you work for the Source I hope they pay you millions
Cause you act like you takin the place of Wendy Williams nigga
I see you in front of my crib in the dark
Lurkin and waitin to see whos car was parked
It aint your chick so why you care for
Why you stop and stare for what you there for
Do you need to know every single thing about my life
Its not enough that I rap and sing about my life
Even when Im sleep you got nothin else to do
But call up your man whos a bitch nigga just like you
Talkin bout my business like it aint nothin
Yall have a two hour discussion on who I might be fuckin
Cats with these feminine ways and traits
Just one example of the type of niggas I hate cmon
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight
These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate
I hate them niggas who just kiss ass
So they can move up in the game like quick fast and they get gassed
Now they walkin round like they so down
Cause they workin up at Motown but slow down nigga
Yall motherfuckers is the worst kind
And I know youre probably hearin this here for the first time
But Imma say that shit other rappers just wont say
Think about it feel it inside but just dont say
Keep them fake hugs when you come in the place
And when I see you Imma say this directly into your face
Yall some fake niggas except now you got a name
And this applies to half of these niggas up in this game
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I had to get a pen and just write this shit down cmon
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you
Never seem to get the shit straight
These are the type of niggas we hate
They smile in your face you think they are friends
They flip and they never be the same again
Come around here actin all fake
These are the type of niggas we hate
I hate bitches that be frontin like they got your back
But when the jump off crack you see its not like that
Certain chicks put the S in snake
Try to give a bitch a break wanna test your weight
Let em stay in your crib even take your whip
Might even babysit while they playin the strip
Kinda chick want to smile up and call you sis
Cant even bring your man around shorty tsk tsk 
Call your moms mom even wear your clothes
Thats why I gotta give it up to them honest hoes
You know what they about from the gate
Stay in there place heres another type of broad I hate What type 
Type to put all of your business in the street uhhuh 
Thats why I only got a handful of peeps
Closely analyze all the new ones I meet
2001 bitches I aint too beat
There you have it
Just a few of examples
And if you cant relate to this shit right here
Chances are youre the type of motherfuckers were talkin about
Ya heard
You see some motherfuckers got nothin to do
But sit around and talk about you

3514,"I Find it Hard to Say Rebel Lyrics
I find it hard to say
That everything is alright
Dont look at me that way
Like everything is alright
Cause my own eyes can see
Through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see
Is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap
And easy to be wasted
As history repeats
So foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lifes so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say
Against these laws of man
Cause like the Bible says
His blood is on their hands
And what I gotta say
And what I gotta say is rebel
While today is still today choose well
And what I gotta say is rebel
It cant go down this way
Choose well choose well choose well
Choose well choose well choose well
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete
And nothing and no one can replace it
No no no no no no no no no no no no
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say and what I gotta say
Is rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel
Rebel rebel rebel rebel rebel
Repent the day is far too spent rebel rebel
Wake up wake up wake up wake up

5526,"Speed of life fast
Its like walking barefoot over broken glass
Its like jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick decisions are made
Lifestyle plush females rush
This high profile personality who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar schoolboys admire
Young girls desire very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme dress code supreme vocabulary obscene
Definition street player you know what I mean
The high rollers x2 
People of the city stop fooling yourself
Crime rules the streets who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash theyll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benzes Ferraris trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to bigtime deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And youre living proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
Youre a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game thats why yall boast
Because youre high priced high speed high post
High roller
Now when I say high rollers I mean the best
Forget the halfsteppers eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of Scarface runnin through their veins
Silk shirts leather suits
Hair always fresh eelskin boots
Large hearts though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruising in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin Pusherman
Yes their fashions high and hard to beat
They buy their Gucci from Guccis not the swap meet
Eat very well much clientele
And whatever you need they probably sell
The high rollers
Oh yes Im here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo or hot as a flame
Theyll shake ya break ya and you wont know their name
Gangsters to the max all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded most men dont understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
Theyre junkies for fun love life on the run
And if things get hot they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame no shame to the game
And they all seek power fuck the fame
The high rollers
Now radio stations probably wont play
This record because of the things I say
Theyll say Im glamorizing the hustling hood
And a record like this can do no good
But Im not here to tell ya right or wrong
I dont know which side of the law you belong
Yes the game has flash but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake hard times lurks
And jails not your only problem though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M16
But to each his own choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit the luxury home
Youll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice
And youre much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right
You wanna be a high roller

Shot with bullets that were meant for me familiys never forgiving me
I know but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner aint quite the future you wanted for me
Was it And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything Ive known owe you everything I own

5466,"Here we are in the apartment corridor
Dorian right yeah I been meaning to speak to you
I dont get up in my neighbours business normally right
But yo these thin ass walls got everything leakin through
Now first things first I dont judge you for the weed smoke
But I can hear your daughter yellin daddy please dont
And its not once or twice but every damn night
Man theres somethin goin on up in here that aint right
Now man to man I can understand
They like to stress a brotha out man we cuss each other out
But you crossin the line by puttin your hands on em
And nobody ever told you not to hit a damn woman
Boy I can tell that my presence was painful
Breathin truth down his neck it must have felt like a strangle
His eyes flashed confusion wavin his hands around
Hes used to raisin his voice on people to back em down
See this is specifically why I left the pistol in the linen closet
Pullin this shit if he was taller I woulda went and got it
Damnit man Im in the right and Im civilized
But little boys really aint used to bein criticized
First off scooter take the bass out your voice
Im respectful with mine and yo you makin a choice
Here and understand its only once that I warn you
Make a move make a threat Ill make it rain knuckles on you
I aint a woman or a baby dawg Im out of your league
My wife heard us gettin loud so shes prayin for peace
She stuck her head out on some keep your temper shit
Little man gon say Close the door mind your business bitch
Ha now thats sweet just what I needed it it seemed that
He invited my right fist for a party on his left cheek
I didnt mean to seem rude so I accepted
But arrived a half a second early right cross connected 
Oh staggered him just by taggin him
Mr tough guy one punch bring out the fag in him
Little man could make moves that I couldnt
He cut and tried to foot it now how should I put it
I stood at full posture and swatted him down the staircase
Bare knuckles to bare face all punches knew their place
Airport style the second one take off the next one land
Learn some respect young man
He glanced down for the brick on the ground
Fist still clenched up Im still stickin his crown
Hes in the jaws of the most turbulant blitz in the world
So fuck hittin ya girl tonight youre hittin the ground
I said somebody need to beat your ass
And then teach your ass and Im sorry I can only do half
And while his mellon swell up a police cruiser pull up
He hopped out all puffed up with the holster of his gun up
Ready to protect and serve
And its in his nature to 38 ya if youre testin his nerves
He helped the wifebeater stand up
But not before he helped Brother Ali into some handcuffs
And you can imagine my surprise
When his girl came down the stairs with tears in her eyes
And a phone in her hand holdin her man
Damn that was not the plan

The tears the tears Ive cried

You dont get paid till the last ones well on his way

Its important that we keep to schedule there must be no delay
I represent a firm of gentlemen who recently purchased this house and all the others in the road
In the interest of humanity weve found a better place for you to gogogo
Oh no this I cant believe
Oh Mary theyre asking us to leave
Get em out by Friday
Ive told you before s good money gone if we let them stay
And if it isnt easy
You can squeeze a little grease and our troubles will soon run away
After all this time they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent
I dont know why it seemed so funny
Seeing as how theyd take more money
The winkler called again he came here this morning
With four hundred pounds and a photograph of the place he has found
A block of flats with central heating
I think were going to find it hard
Now weve got them
Ive always said that cash cash cash can do anything well
Work can be rewarding
When a flash of intuition is a gift that helps you excelsellsellsell
Here we are in Harlow New Town did you recognise your block
Across the square over there
Sadly since last time we spoke weve found weve had to raise the rent again
Just a bit
Oh no this I cant believe
Oh Mary and we agreed to leave
This is an announcement from Genetic Control
It is my sad duty to inform you of a four foot restriction on
Humanoid height
I hear the directors of Genetic Control have been buying all the
Properties that have recently been sold taking risks oh so bold
Its said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
they say its alright 
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity theyve been told they must go
Told they must gogogogo
I think Ive fixed a new deal
A dozen properties well buy at five and sell at thirty four
Some are still inhabited
Its time to send the winkler to see them
Hell have to work some more
With land in your hand youll be happy on earth
Then invest in the Church for your heaven

233,"Take me to the station
And put me on a train
Ive got no expectations
To pass through here again
Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before
Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind
Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
Its here and then its gone
So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
Ive got no expectations
To pass through here again

5645,"Yo I met this girl the other night
Hype superdope body and face her miniskirt tight
Talkin bout legs and lips mindblowin hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told meI was the one
I said Why she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now thats the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said Fast slow hard or soft baby
She said All the above
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
Now I aint no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you she was on some motherfuckin sex trip
Took me to her crib that night leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobelight
And started buggin lightin candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
Yo my pants were on but so what
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkeyass up
Faster than I could say No
It was like a rodeo I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip I said Shit
This girl had crazy plans for the night
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
Now whips aint all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitchs pad
Im talking about latex suits spikeheeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said Dontdontdont whip me
Ill do anything you ask
And then homegirl stripped 38 tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass
This girl tried to kill me
She didnt use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me
She didnt use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin baby oil on her chest
And then she said Gimme gimme gimme
Jumped on my Jimmy and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin husband sixfoot ten
I knew my life would soon end
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didnt use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me
Yoyo nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didnt use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me
Cause he had caught me fuckin his wife
Yo

7557,"Holy Ghost Remix Lyrics
Tell to myself still on fire
Im under attack but Im still on fire
I got some chatter but Im still on fire
I got some threat but Im still on fire
I got some liabilities but Im still on fire
If its not amazing that Im on fire
Ive been to hell and back but Im still on fire
Whats in the back of my mind sittin in the back of that thang
With the two double R sittin in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here thats what I told my chauffeur
And this shit gettin heavy weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out but you dont have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlin for draws and now theres plaques on the walls
Think Im sellin my soul Then you can come get em all
Trade em all for my dawgs yea Im talkin to you
Where did we go wrong Because I dont have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But its real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life you didnt deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look its somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame I charge it all to the game
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga half a mili automobile
Im talkin real luxury dont feel a bump in the road
We aint like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takin it really had me disgusted
Nigga who am I kiddin It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didnt ask for it back
And to be honest with you I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we got each other
Woulda done anything took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livin large
Gangster pitted it kills gave you your first mill
And I aint tell you to blow it I aint tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure yea I know it can stress ya
But youre only a man homie I aint mad at ya
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em
And when you made it that far you should be makin a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doin the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
I swear the Lord is my shepherd Im bout to go cop a Lexus
Im bout to go fuck Alexis take this and flood my Rolexes
This black on black is a blessin
Black on black crime on my weapon
I protect mine on my mama and em these my Usher confessions
Let it burn TeeTee and Tiana sexting
Teepees and mansions I rest in
Two Ts and Top Dawg impress with
TVs that play their investment
KDOT go tee off and TGs and YGs gon press it
Its our turn I pray that I never lose you
Cause I like Benji and beaucoup bucks at my wrists
They do voodoo curse you forever you better not touch it
The clutching Im used to 250 speed racing crucial
Nigga Vrrrrm
Check that homie out homie thats KDot 
My youngins asking me do you consider role models useful
Its hard to say when Im neutral Im tryna find out myself
Find inner peace inside heaven find diamond piece inside hell
Will I learn
Please Lord forgive him you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And aint nobody gave us nothin so we drug dealin
You know we coppin Louie loafers just to thug in em

3287,"Now many many years ago
When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grownup daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed
This made my dad my soninlaw
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
Because she was my fathers wife
To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became
A brotherinlaw to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widows grownup daughter
Who of course was my stepmother
Im my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Im my own grandpa
My fathers wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughters son
My wife is now my mothers mother
And it makes me blue
Because she is my wife
Shes my grandmother too
Im my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Im my own grandpa

Then I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild

You dont know
Dont tell me Negro
Thats nothing
What were you before the white man named you a Negro
What was your name
It couldnt have been Smith or Jones or Bush or Powell
That wasnt your name
They dont have those kind of names where you and I came from
No what was your name
And why dont you now know what your name was then
Where was your history
How did a man wipe out your history
How did the man what did the man do to make you as dumb as you are right now
Motherfuckas I just bought some new chuckas
The old ones bloodied up from stomping out mo suckas
Big bad Killa
Big black gorilla
King Kong on you monkey ass niggas
Step and fetch funky ass flunky ass niggas
Dick in the booty for your Massa ass niggas
I dont fear no man
Not Bush not Clinton not Osama
Ask your Uncle Thomas how he choose Massa over Obama
You could have a million dollars and a white collar
Liberation costs more then a damn dollar
It costs what Christ gave
King gave
X gave
A billion dollars dont make you an exslave
Nigga With an Attitude since fifth grade
I never behave
Rather be a dead man than a live slave
We can say what we like
Put the pressure on em
Ice Cube and Killer Mike
Put the pressure on em
I can do what I want
Put the pressure on em
But god dammit Im gonna
Put the pressure on em

What they made your great granddaddy do
Without a dollar or a penny or a thank you
The same motherfuckers wanna gank you
Cause they hate you and the pussy that you came through
Can anybody tell me that it aint true
That these motherfuckers aint out to hurt you
Theyll lock you up beat you up and work you
Put your life on a thirty year curfew
Little cell little window for you to look through
Even gotta a little chair where he can cook you
Nigga please Imma be in the breeze
Beat em up with my plan like the Japanese
Now Im overseas
And Im trapping these
Thank God I didnt have to cock and squeeze
Black politicians stop bullshitting
And you funky black preachers with your pulpit
Our kings had dreams and a big vision
All you give us is government and religion
Is you a freedom fighter or a stool pigeon
Is you down for your people in the big mission
Or you a dirty nigga working for a fucking Clinton
Or you dirty nigga working for a fucking Bush
Another message for the politicians
Better get the police off our ass quickly
If another old lady die in this city
Swear to god we will burn down the fucking city
Big schemes
Big dreams
Yeah Im with it folk
But twenty years of selling dope just a fucking joke
And so what you the man with that white man
Probation got your answering to a white man

These pigs going ham sammich
In New York killed a young brother
In Atlanta killed a grandmother
And politicians say save the planet
Fuck that save us dammit
From the black pigs helped em kill Sean Bell
I hope its five degrees hotter for your ass in hell
Race traitin bastard you less than trash
I hope when Jesus come back he murder your ass
So you burn in hell til you turn white ash
To the one that say sorry tell em kiss our ass
We dont need em motherfucker you can keep it for yourself
I wish you nothing but pain and bad health
I hope luck run away from you and wealth
No honor in life no honor in death
You a Judas to us nigga kill yourself
No Negro leaders have fought for civil rights
They have begged for civil rights
They have begged the white man for civil rights
They have begged the white man for freedom
And anytime you beg another man to set you free
You will never be free
Freedom is something you have to do for yourselves
And until the American Negro lets the white man know
That we are really really ready and willing to pay the price that is necessary for freedom
Our people will always be walking around and second class citizens or what you call twentieth century slaves
What price are you talking about sir 
The price of freedom is death

That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Aint gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning

Do plenty of shit cause this life how many you get
How many niggas do you know get two
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a lifebid be one a your crew

Lessons detrimental to a young disciple

Keep your enemies close where they can see you

Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
Yo

And let my balls hang like Im on a toilet taking a shit
My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip Drip 
Fuck all that sensuous shit Drip 
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your clique holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman I shift with the ruck
If your if was a spliff wed be all fucked up Word up 
No need to ask you Who is he Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard on many rough cities
Chicago LA any of em Ill have to Norman Bate you Yeah 
I love ta hate you cause yous a freak by nature
Cant wait to face ya mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight with no chaser Word up 
My verbal combats like a miniMac to your back Uhhuh 
As soon as one of you niggas try to overreact Blaow 
The LOD love good confrontation or vamp Word up 
Break your concentration murder your camp Haha 
For the jealous overzealous we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis Bombombom bombombom 
Niggas coming through and acting wild Word 
Yall commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile

Forgot what I already knew ayo you hear me friend
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Secret society trying to keep they eye on me Nah nah 
But Ima stay incogni in places they cant find me
Make my moves strategically the GOD

My Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin title read
You get backslapped so hard make ya nose bleed Ahh 
Some def kids feeling guilty bout the space shit
The truth hurts baby girl so just face it Alright 
But anyway back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing Kid 
Everything is real not just a song that we sing Word up 
From my life to the paper What very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three

How dare you ever in your life walk past me What 
Without acknowledging this man as GOD
I shot your faggot ass
Ugh now who the fuck you think you talking to

Runnin this racket from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
Id rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitchass niggas know we stronger than these weaklings
Seeking for respect that aint there
Knuckleheads beware theres mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulette this mans wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razorwhich I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spat out at any adult that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Mad at the fact that somebodys getting lucci thats not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture
Joey Crack aka Keyser Sze

7983,"I do dirt in search of a clear mind
Money talk somebodys gonna hear mine
Grind early before 930
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death you heard me
My world aint worldly any time could be my time
I get high but still aint seen Chicago skyline
In my prime stakes is high cause its beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents we want the same face
And to think me and the president we from the same place
Fourhundred and twentyone murders aint tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven will I make it through the main gate
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Ah yes my Lord
Ah ah ahah ohohoh

Ah ah ahah ohohoh
Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap he was about to get put on
At his funeral listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming I hurt for em
A cold world thats why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
Ima need to go back I gots to get em
Back and forth in these streets thats the rhythm
Revenge is posed to be the Lords but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch cost my man his life
I cant afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

My money aint straight my fam aint straight
Aint wanna push kis Heaven couldnt wait
I was hurting couldnt get no work
You created me from dustthats why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now Im in a hearse whats this cash really worth
My whole life I had to worry bout eating
I aint have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the Kingdom for Chicago gon come
Im coming back like the Prodigal Son and I got a son
And I dont want my ways following him
The streets swallowing him and I dont want no hollows in him
His mama say she see his father in him hope its the good things
Til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates cause I know youve forgiven what Ive done
Im your son do I have the keys to get in

Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

Sweet Lord Jesus tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning fathers seed
Got a shipment by the sea see my niggas tryna eat
Eat whatevers on your plate save some for me
The worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to Heaven cause I couldnt get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back cause these stripes aint free
We still wading in the water
Cocaine blunts marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell em Talk is cheap niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust leave the praying to my mama though
Another motherfucker out of control just walking my soles
Whoa littered with the abuse
They wasnt for show I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day barefaced giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you They know me on the streets where I grew
If you aint from round here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for the keys to the kingdom
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh Sing 
Help me get get the keys to the kingdom Yeah

And just for that I wanna thank you a lot
Word is bond yall look so good
Every time I see ya in my neighborhood
My crew bugs out when theyre in the party
Instead of baby got back baby got body
Cause youre all shapes and sizes look good in jeans
Wanna do me somethin juicy I know what they mean
Im not tryin to be nasty Im just keepin it real
This goes out to my people who know how I feel
Biz Markie 
All you ladies in the nice tight jeans 
You look good to me

It was so soft and mesmerizin
I met her in Jersey by   
Oh my goodness I almost lost my mind
When I saw this heehaw that was so divine
Now I would usually just kept goin
But it hypnotized me the way she was throwin
I said You want a burger and fries with that shake
She said No I want shrimp lobbster and a steak
Bein Rockefeller is not my duty
The only reason I changed my mind is because
You look good to me
Tell you what happened to me while I was mindin my biz
I came across a girl by the name of Liz
Puerto Rican or Spanish almost went frantic
For bein a 10 she was a body mechanic
I was beebeein on what I was seein
Its like Pocahontas jumped out the TV an
Hourglass shape that made me go ape
Ask Lil Mo she was a superwoman with a cape
She couldnt speak no English I had Fat Joe with me
So he could tell me what she was sayin about me
She said I like papi with big belly
I said Whyd you tell her in Spanish that I want her tele
phone now you know its on
Like hot butter on say what the popcorn
I had to have that cause shes a cutie
And you know the other reason why is because
You look good to me
When I walk through the club what do I see
A real fly cutie
You look good to me
You look good to me
That ass is fat
Oh Lord yeah
You yeah oh look good
Oh yeah
Everytime I walk by
I wanna look in your eye
And you look so fly

7569,"Niggas is tellin me about this Illuminati shit while Im in jail thats another way to keep your selfesteem low thats another way to keep you unconfident And Im putting the K cause Im killing that Illuminati shit Trust me These motherfuckers wanted to kill you why the fuck they gonna tell Farrakhan why they gonna tell the Nation of Islam why they gonna tell this nigga in jail about the plan How did he know Howd it leak to him Who told him Who told him the Pope Who Cause they like the Pope and the money aw cmon man get the fuck outta here
Oh you niggas wanna get deep
Niggas wanna kick knowledge Yall niggas aint deep man
Yall niggas lost me
Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin Illuminati
Then Im like show me the proof right
Niggas start talking about the antiChrist and aliens and shit
Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga
Im a grown ass man Lets go lets go
You can lead a man to a drink but you cant make him take a sip
You can lead a man to a link but that dont mean he gonn click
Whats this Yall aint really on no deep shit I peeped it
Scared of a motherfuckin secret society
And only bein with people you agree with you scared of a
Chalice scared of death only thing worse is your silence
Illuminatis enlightened the OWL see in the darkness
Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed
Egyptologist and scholars symbologists at the college
Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started
Way farther back than the knights or the Rite of the Scottish
You need to wake up no new Bugatti Yes 
My enemy tryna stop me
But I dont stand a chance if I cant identify em properly
Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria
Years before it landed on the shores of America
The mission abolishment of government and religion
They were enemys of the state and they was hated by the Christians
They was Poets they was Scholars early Illuminati was
Sorta like the students in Victor Hugos Les Miserables
The modern day politicians would diss em turning them into martyrs
This in turn inspired the founding fathers
The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati
Found this fascination the order was insipiration Keep it goin 
And aint no disrespect to the masons
But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation
Only those in league with Satan need to hide infomation
Thats how you catch a ride to your final destination
Where the proof show em proof put it all on the table
When the facts are intact aint no need for a fable
Good versus evil is primitive
Real lifes more complex whats your context
They put the symbols on the dollar bill the monument the obelisk
They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists
You can trace it back to the root trace it back again
Its really just another case of stealin from the African
Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh
You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh
Population control is real word you know the deal but still
Perpetuate the cycle of violence we known to hold the steel
No I dont need no fuckin chorus
Used to read so many books thought I was a hoarder down at Borders
Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order
But you really dont know what you reading if you really dont know the author
A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda
Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander
Of course there are forces against you and thats a fact
Dont get caught in the distraction its bigger than any rapper
The truly oppressed aint got the luxury of inventing a monster
The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert
What they doing so sinister worse than any blood sacrifice
You can imagine iller than any cinema
The Federal Reserve the World Bank and the IMF
Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath
Food vaccines humanitarian aid
They want control of the region they really tryna get paid
Obey thy consumer make a product out of man
Wheres the conspiracy Its always been the plan
Yall niggas scared of one world currency but still paying your
Taxes it aint the Illuminati that worry me
Lack of spiritual energy suicidal tendencies
Unwitting soldiers in the armies of your enemy
Im leaking information so follow me down the wormhole
Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat


Man we supposed to be brothas 
Oh what you tryna get smart
Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge
Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga
Take that shit off
Beeping 
Oh you got a pager too huh
You a balla huh You a balla huh
Gimme that muthafuckin shit

All eyes on ya
Ask you how your week been
Workin always let me
Work you out for the weekend
Baby Im a beast uhhuh
Can you tame me
Im gon let it out
Lay you down
Lets get to it
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London Paris see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage seorita
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza
Breakfast on the beach that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin like a fruit platter Ima bite into your peach
And um I think about to massage your feet
And um you got a body you remind of my Jeep
And um I must look amazing with you
Cause every time you on my arm I got
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one Im missin
All eyes on me
I dont want your love
We aint gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you
Member when you used to curved me leave my text message unread
And every time I asked to see you you say you goin to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin
Now you in my living room twerkin thats crazy
You wear that body suit I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller shed rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezys
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now thats my vagina she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one Im missin
All eyes on me
I dont want your love
We aint gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you
Lookin at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan lick on party favorite
On my wave tryna surf it up
Know we gettin gnarly smokin Marley burnin up
Certified with the doubleM pullin up
Tooly got a room well play Room Up In Here been here
Girl you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what Im missin
All the lights low but we lit up
I dont let you down if I get up
Like you got a man but youre fed up
But you know when we get together
You want me to say your name huh
Karrueche
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me

5871,"Cause the feeling is gone 
And I must get it back
Trust me nothing prepares us
They never say gettin money slows your prayers up
We already in Hell Nothin can scare us
We already fly high nothin can air us
Came from the underground so I stay grounded astounded
By all the bullshit that I founded
A wise man can lose you soon as he gain jewels
Life get real and you think the pains cool
You different you makin a change you let your man tell it
Blowin chronic am I demonic or angelic
No vanilla Dutch fuck it get a panetela
Roll a one sheet think about my rap sheet
Sellin crack will have you runnin like a track meet
Watchin your back on every other back street
I started so young why you think Im so numb
You cant feel shit and only like real shit
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you dont know what block Im front of
DBlock layin em down
And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock
You know my name you heard my raps
You know my name aint nuttin changed
SP and I done been through it all
From here on I spit it in rare form
The moon stay quiet but the sun spoke
Still cant blow away the pain with the blunt smoke
Tryin to give my daughter and my son hope
The shit get rough when you breathin in the gun smoke
Do it all for a pile of the cash funny
But I really only smile when I laugh thats all 
You can say the pain run deep and I wonder
Do the insane or the sane ones speak
And I feel like the devil got chains on me
Im inside but I still feel the rain on me
Its raining like its comin through the window or the windshield
Life full of sinsll have you spinnin like a windmill
Contract with God is signed and it been sealed
See you at the crossroads if everything has been real
I can feel what you cant
And the shit is vice versa so feel what you cant


You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you dont know what block Im front of
DBlock layin em down
And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock
You know my name you heard my raps
You know my name aint nuttin changed
SP and I done been through it all
From here on I spit it in rare form
I told you it is what it is
Cant choose how to die but I can choose how to live true 
Thought about it just sittin where I live
Just another ghetto nigga with a million dollar crib
No hope then I dropped the E and got hoppin
Got hip just so I could get a little guap you get it 
Before that I used to move rock
With a 4 to 10 job after school workin stock word 
Then I said Fuck pickin up a box
So I sold more drugs started stickin mo spots
Thats why I thank God for this rap shit
Niggas be frontin cause we used to livin backwards
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you dont know what block Im front of
DBlock layin em down
And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock
You know my name you heard my raps
You know my name aint nuttin changed
SP and I done been through it all
From here on I spit it in rare form",still feel the rain on me Its raining like its comin through the window or the windshield Life full of sinsll have you spinnin like a windmill Contract with God is signed and it been sealed See you at the crossroads if everything has been real I can feel what you cant And the shit is vice versa so feel what you cant You can act stupid if you wanna Like you dont know what block Im front of DBlock layin em down And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock You know my name you heard my raps You know my name aint nuttin changed SP and I done been through it all From here on I spit it in rare form I told you it is what it is Cant choose how to die but I can choose how to live true Thought about it just sittin where I live Just another ghetto nigga with a million dollar crib No hope then I dropped the E and got hoppin Got hip just so I could get a little guap you get it Before that I used to move rock With a 4 to 10 job after school workin stock word Then I said Fuck pickin up a box So I sold more drugs started stickin mo spots Thats why I thank God for this rap shit Niggas be frontin cause we used to livin backwards You can act stupid if you wanna Like you dont know what block Im front of DBlock layin em down And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock You know my name you heard my raps You know my name aint nuttin changed SP and I done been through it all From here on I spit it in rare form,Cause the feeling is gone And I must get it back Trust me nothing prepares us They never say gettin money slows your prayers up We already in Hell Nothin can scare us We already fly high nothin can air us Came from the underground so I stay grounded astounded By all the bullshit that I founded A wise man can lose you soon as he gain jewels Life get real and you think the pains cool You different you makin a change you let your man tell it Blowin chronic am I demonic or angelic No vanilla Dutch fuck it get a panetela Roll a one sheet think about my rap sheet Sellin crack will have you runnin like a track meet Watchin your back on every other back street I started so young why you think Im so numb You cant feel shit and only like real shit You can act stupid if you wanna Like you dont know what block Im front of DBlock layin em down And I aint never plannin to stop Im plannin to rock You know my name you heard my raps You know my name aint nuttin changed SP and I done been through it all From here on I spit it in rare form The moon stay quiet but the sun spoke Still cant blow away the pain with the blunt smoke Tryin to give my daughter and my son hope The shit get rough when you breathin in the gun smoke Do it all for a pile of the cash funny But I really only smile when I laugh thats all You can say the pain run deep and I wonder Do the insane or the sane ones speak And I feel like the devil got chains on me Im inside but I
7501,"Hope Ft Faith Evans Lyrics
I wish the way I was living could stop serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when Im on the block And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I wont have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail And I
Wish that my grandmother wasnt sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick And I I wish 
Wish my homies wouldnt have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song And I I wish 
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi And I
Wish My hommie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride And I I wish 
Wish that God could protect us from the wrong
So all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
We would never break
Though they devastate
We shall motivate
And we gotta pray all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better so you aint gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer get ya money man life goes on
Lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful Hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay
Cause we hopeful
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up I wish 
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have em trippin of the joy I bring
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man And I I wish 
Wish the families that lack but got love get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lac thats on dubs And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder you feel me  I wish 
And I hope all the kids eat
And dont nobody in my family see six feet ya dig 
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone And I I wish 
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R Kelly And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again I wish 
That one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish we could never get the blues
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2 I wish 
I wish that we could walk a path stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way
I know it aint easy but thats okay
Cause we hopeful
Wish the earth wasnt so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic
If you dont listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldnt have to go to war
Why cant we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr King Why cant we all just get along
Hope we can find a better way to shop and please And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if its you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church
And lets HOPE
Though Im hopeful yes I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away let it take you away 
And be hopeful hopeful and hell make a way

Sheets of empty canvas untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Mm and all I taught her was everything
Mm I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside Im surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter so why do I sear
Mm and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
Im spinning oh Im spinning how quick the sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see all that I am all Ill be yeah

8060,"Im a ninedimensional being spitting photon directional beams
CBD serve my medical needs
Move your ass nigga aint got no gravitas
Ima tell you one time me and you are not sized
There is no secret for patience the key to being patient is sacred
And those results are not easily taken
You want to build Do it for real
Unite brother steel sharpens steel
Listen to me just breathe 
Yea I be oldschool growling communities by the thousands and counting
Coming down off a Mingledorff mountain
With books and tube pouches and million dollar equipment vouchers
Education you aint shit without it how about it
They took the game make it hard to support that lane
YouTube views probably bought that fame
Id rather go to bass shop pro than deal with yo ignorant ass yo
cause our people are always last to know
Rap music should have been had unions but it dont
Try to get em to stop the confusion but they wont
And now here we are 2018 still got the same problems
Chaos a prelude to conflict
You know necessity is the mother of ideas
And a bad idea is the father of all fears
The black and loud herd mentality crowd dreadlocks
Be looking like some dirty ass black and milds
If you aint melanated Black or brown You aint down
How that sound Whos possessed by the spirit of a savage now
You better check them false facts in your files
Divisionll have your mouth starving looking for a hand out
Man down everybody fan out its your fault the plan went south
Say the word you the big man now
I dont think so they move every way the wind blow
Kimbo purse snatch a bimbo dont get shit though
Homie these niggas lonely and phony
Crowdfunded for groceries some of these Hotep niggas is hungry
I germinated the waters you just tasting out of my faucet
You like the taste We created the sourcessauces
The Jamaican mason cooking Cajun bacon with a figleaf apron
With the information to raise a nation
The green is the Ankh the black is the God
My gold staff is a stick that makes buckets of lard
Lord Have Mercy that nigga got bars
James Bond with a turbosaw but still they resent the God
Spit bars til my voice goes hoarse circular saws slice jaws
No novacaine but take twice as long
I am the monk of Mingledorff I mutilate every single song
My drum machine cut your fingers off
Lets talk I see where you went wrong
You was smoking embalming fluid out the morgue and held your breathe too long
Yea Im floored but my God is an awesome God
Meanwhile your paws are too short to walk with dogs
Mt Rushmore Olmec face your security clearance not up to date
So Ima have to stop you at the gate
Thermovision whistles and bells your superheat smells
So on your way to Hell let me give you this cool gel
Sound off let me hear you yell who you gonna tell
When I was proofreading the grail You was learning how to spell
Talk to my abbot I hooked the dragon up to your wagon
2018 you talking about horsepower you lackin
Layerin raps matching you still mackieboard four tracking
Rip the Jacker got all the action
Canibus Cambatta classic Full Spectrum Dominance
Triple blackness release the albino kraken
On the bible I swore solemnly
Lord watching me born of a moor progeny
Source of a pure prophecy
Before Constantine travel to Nicaea and courted a core following
Modestly freedom before sovereignty
I dont believe in the theme of a war policy
Amistad land of the street and like four blocks from me
Cinque speaking and God orator pompously
My phrase couplets change the way brains function
Hard metal skin brown cause its rain rusted
Tie ropes to your limbs then i play puppets
Cut a hole in your stomach then i make munchkins
I ate tongues to taste tastebuds
If you taste my tastebuds youll taste bud
I showed up at gunfights and gave hugs
Make em put they guns down
Shoot em with the same gun blame drugs
Failure is the best lesson
She didnt know my name but she kept guessing
I told her gold string makes the best threading
When I rump my steel skin deflects weapons
Teflon chest vested lungs burning
Breath ganja sweat resin epleptic epileptic 
Before the beginning I knew the best ending
Thought of the answer before the next question
Soothsayer earth sun moonmaker
Born instantly mother never knew labor
Shroom taker Obi with the blue saber
Legend King James left out like a new maker
Whos greater I draw a circle on a Etch A Sketch
No birth defects but I got death defects
Exhale reach out catch the breath
We inhale it back in before the second breath
Melchizedek hope is like a god that I never met
Sleeping so hard that I rest erect
I found a treasure chest
Ima carry as much as my hands hold then Im leaving you whatevers left
I rotate the earth with my feet
Like Im running on the top exterior of a hamster wheel
Hes the Morpheus Im the Exile
In the simulation we got the keys and the pills
Dr Seuss talk to Zeus
Jump up grab the sun alleyoop
Break the chain to the subconscious loop
Prophets moms are commonly prostitutes
Gods recruit lies are the honest truth
Crabs are big spiders in lobster suits cute 
Pen sharp when I write cut a desk in half
My writtens are better chiseled than metal slabs
Lift iron my sceptres a magnetic staff
Long blade hidden inside like a machete has
Repenting penning a pentagram in a pantograph
Fresh up out the pen in a pentagon with a weapon stash
Get it past sleight of hand Penn Teller fast
Fast like the Pentium i9 that Dellll have
Heavy like appendix that Adelell have
White singer Lightbringer let the devil cast
Horse legs Annamite figure goat head attached
Born Siamese till I ate the second half like a breakfast snack
Colorblind only see things in the three that my spectrum has
Green red and black like the Kenyan flag
Every fella Helen Keller ever met is black
I love neck so much I bought a pet giraffe
Bang arm like funny bone and then I laugh
Fist iron beat sand out a heavy bag
Right jab right jab tip to the left and jab
Left body uppercut head hit the leather mat
Hopefully he wakes up after ten seconds pass
I hit him harder than gettin past a depressin past
I throw my durag in the sea and trigger a three
Hundred and sixty degree tidal wave
We are each one cell in a giant brain
Life a game self is the boss in the final stage
Compared to the Nephilim Yao Mings a dwarf
King of lords with double door to Mingledorff
Cambatta Canibus bring a cross
Carry it up a mountain till we exhaust

Watch old 97 roll
And then a telegram came to Washington station
This is how it read
It said That brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying down in Danville dead
He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam
So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Dont you speak hard words to your true lover husband
He may leave you and never return

Through the mans mind God
He see his elevation God
See through his mind he see his elevation God
See this where he begin to know that where he come from
See some people dont have no direction God
Because they dont know the science of they self
See the signs of life is the signs of you
All the elements that it took to create you
Everything thats in the universe God
Thats created the universe God is just within you
You see what Im sayin
And thats the mind that you cant see
Dont you know if a man could take and flip himself inside out God
Hell fall out and die if he sees the shit that goes oninside
So you mean to tell me Im the creator of all this right here
You the creator of all this
Because all these things must happen it must take place
See people go back in the day God
They say one man one woman Adam and Eve there aint no such thing
Everything you see always has been and always will what be
Regardless the womb or what its got to be
Hit me hit me hit me I dont wanna hear nothin
Word Up
Got to pay
Yeah its like that right
Blow his back out make his shoes worth
Ayo this shit be off the noggin rock it
Whatever cock block it
Cat get blown who own this street corner
Foreigner hesitate to rock a Hummer
Navy Seal top runner rhyme this summer
For real marinating niggas skating
Debating waiting style flowingly relating

The mission is mine fabulous king I divine
Titanium Hydro collide though
Yo dun dun polly this conjunction son one
Slang doctor medicated kids pay it
Say it these niggas in affect dun stay rap related

Poet designer sharp like Linus
Mic of the year award fly gear award
Them niggas over there be analyzing with one sword
Get bent pay the rent plus still we invent
Nuff shit to get your whole team crazily sent
Now all I need is a half gallon of weed
Proceed to bust this mic dick and make three seeds
Then max out like two Acs inside the parking lot
Son bark a lot and get his team hit in the dark a lot
What now blow clicking like a calico
Gold Maximillion one love keep it real yo
Yo hit me for these Tommy Hill icerocking niggas
Peace this summers mines I blow the biggest
Back up off me while I grab my dick and hold the Heini
Park the Blue 600 Wally kings is right behind me
Tackle clubs never rock Lugz Im way above
These mics is like the Golden Gloves verses spark plug
Its like the pennant seminars the playoff
Start the J off like Cochran got OJ off
This specialist who eyeballed your mistress necklace
Perpetuous this curlyhead kids treacherous
Let go the eggo so we can dip dip dive like Lego
Throw on cancan eat that plus this instrumental
Ah shit say Starkologist
Starksologist fried fish halibut
Pull out the bull horn lets celebrate like Kunta was born
We elbowed our way inside Loud and got on
I played the building burn a branch and get filled in
Like Pilgrims Gin Pepridge farms from out of millions
Who wanna rhyme who wanna challenge the swordmans
That rock that fisherman hat like Gortons
I hold down the place no shots to the face
Elite Special force no religious style faith
The melting pot boil gun shot drama soil
Gamble when I scramble handle hot pots of oil
Manhandle pain killing erect my hidden
Streets made me potent put your 96 bid in
Vampire curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water axe slaughter through my earth
Youre hit by my element Great Wall of China
Mountain peak holds the globe like vagina
Measure on my mic stand molecule and strand
Finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
Golden Eye Spy vs Spy guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer mic in dead body position
40 oz Cigaart three verse invention
Divine universal black man representing
Similar to pure rhyme blowing out the pore
Battery in the back keep me charged for the raw

5875,"Ladies and gentleman my name is Macklemore This is my music and it feels so damn good right about now Check it I got a story yo it goes a little something like
When I was seventeen I was staying in NYC
And my homie told me where I could get a fake ID
Ayo son you better get that shit when you in NY okay 
So I hopped on the subway and I gave it a try
To my pleasant surprise the ID looked fine
59 blues eyes born in nineteenseventynine just right 
Nervous as hell I went to the store with my homie
Came out and yelled Dawg they sold me a 40
Yeah you know that I was the man
Buying liquid contraband with a fake ass hologram
No more looking for bums standing in the rain
Stranded on Broadway and giving em all my change
For the rest of the summer man I was on fades
Seventeen had it made getting drunk everyday
Ayy I got treated a whole new way
Because of a piece of plastic that proved I was of age
You know what Im saying all of a sudden you get this little piece of plastic and youre in the club Seventeen like bah Check it out its like this yo
Now for the next three years I had so much fun
Getting drunk in hiphop clubs where you had to be twentyone
Then one day I was walking and I saw a sign
That said KRSOne twentyone up and live
Thats hella tight
Ayo I heard he always ripped it
So I hopped up in my Civic and went out to buy a ticket
When I got up the the door the bouncer checking IDs
Looks at mine and hes like Nah we dont take these
I tried to reach and grab my shit back
But the mother fucker was tougher than Shaq on crack
I shouldve punched him but I would have reached his knee cap
And that probably wouldnt have hurt him very much
He kept laughing and smilin he called me a dumb shit
And if I wouldve let myself I would have cried in public
Oh no Im like Give it back bro
But no my ID was jacked by the Caucasian Deebo
Ha Im laughing right now but at the time it really was not funny and its still not very funny Fucker
Bitch why you got to take my ID
Why do I have to be 21 to drink a Long Island Iced Tea
I hate bouncers with their bald heads and ten foot tall legs
And shirts that they outgrew when they were like ten
Get em
Your mother is dumb for having you
Youre a bouncer because you have a small dick and as a kid everyone laughed at you
Get em
Youre too big and you never seemed to listen
You look injected with the shit they give to KFC chickens
Get em
I dont like ya at all I despise you
If I was tall I would fight you
If I was a dog I would bite you
Every single day you make people cry
And your job is to go and ruin teenagers lives
Ok Im going too far bouncers arent all bad
Im sure they make great husbands and really strong dads
But hopefully you learned a lesson from me
Never take an MCs fake ID
Yup I said never take an MCs fake ID
You could be buff and tough it dont matter to me
Cause youre going to get burned if you step to MCs
",these I tried to reach and grab my shit back But the mother fucker was tougher than Shaq on crack I shouldve punched him but I would have reached his knee cap And that probably wouldnt have hurt him very much He kept laughing and smilin he called me a dumb shit And if I wouldve let myself I would have cried in public Oh no Im like Give it back bro But no my ID was jacked by the Caucasian Deebo Ha Im laughing right now but at the time it really was not funny and its still not very funny Fucker Bitch why you got to take my ID Why do I have to be 21 to drink a Long Island Iced Tea I hate bouncers with their bald heads and ten foot tall legs And shirts that they outgrew when they were like ten Get em Your mother is dumb for having you Youre a bouncer because you have a small dick and as a kid everyone laughed at you Get em Youre too big and you never seemed to listen You look injected with the shit they give to KFC chickens Get em I dont like ya at all I despise you If I was tall I would fight you If I was a dog I would bite you Every single day you make people cry And your job is to go and ruin teenagers lives Ok Im going too far bouncers arent all bad Im sure they make great husbands and really strong dads But hopefully you learned a lesson from me Never take an MCs fake ID Yup I said never take an MCs fake ID You could be buff and tough it dont matter to me Cause youre going to get burned if you step to MCs,Ladies and gentleman my name is Macklemore This is my music and it feels so damn good right about now Check it I got a story yo it goes a little something like When I was seventeen I was staying in NYC And my homie told me where I could get a fake ID Ayo son you better get that shit when you in NY okay So I hopped on the subway and I gave it a try To my pleasant surprise the ID looked fine 59 blues eyes born in nineteenseventynine just right Nervous as hell I went to the store with my homie Came out and yelled Dawg they sold me a 40 Yeah you know that I was the man Buying liquid contraband with a fake ass hologram No more looking for bums standing in the rain Stranded on Broadway and giving em all my change For the rest of the summer man I was on fades Seventeen had it made getting drunk everyday Ayy I got treated a whole new way Because of a piece of plastic that proved I was of age You know what Im saying all of a sudden you get this little piece of plastic and youre in the club Seventeen like bah Check it out its like this yo Now for the next three years I had so much fun Getting drunk in hiphop clubs where you had to be twentyone Then one day I was walking and I saw a sign That said KRSOne twentyone up and live Thats hella tight Ayo I heard he always ripped it So I hopped up in my Civic and went out to buy a ticket When I got up the the door the bouncer checking IDs Looks at mine and hes like Nah we dont take
5045,"I loved you fore I knew that you existed
It isnt really anybodys business
Not asking for permission or a witness
It honestly doesnt make any difference
Living in this insane mess
Theres only one person that can make me make sense
Ive got troubles and my own fears
But as long as youre alive Im not alone here
My mirror when Im right near you
Your guiding light shines to see my life clearer
Youre so woven inside my spirit
Even when youre not around I feel you
Lord knows they dont come no realer
My soul road dog my healer
The only reason I believe in me
Im trying to be what you seem to see
When the highs get low and the joys turn woes
Ill be close forever and a day
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
Right When your world start falling I can read about it all in your face
You aint even gotta say
They cant take that away

When you make your mistakes my heart is a place
Where youre safe I never would betray
They cant take that away
They cant take that away
And what you made mine is true
Lifetime full of treasures Ill never repay
They cant take that away
I love you and theres nothing you can do about it
I love you right through all your human problems
I mightve got excited at you and shouted
But you never let me down when it truly counted
Nothing could ever break the bond
Whatever page youre on
Celebrate or mourn babies born or parents gone
No matter how crazy the storm you wont face it alone
The best part of me is drawn to you
Me and anything I own belong to you
I treasure everything important to you
Any secret I ever had I show them to you
I owe you nothing but the whole truth
I wouldnt want to meet the me that doesnt know you

And what you made mine is a true ah its love 
Lifetime full of treasures Ill never repay
They cant take that away they can t take that away
Oh my God now
These are wounds not scars
It will only be a scar when it stops bleeding stops hurting
You can forget about scars
But you cannot forget about wounds
Everyone meets the injured with sympathy or disgust
Do you need a tissue
No I need stitches

8115,"Joey what you said 24 right
Aight cool I got you
I define gutter every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch hiphop got my spine smothered
But Ill be fine brother my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing thats word to my mother
You throw a shot at me Im throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint mines whistling by your top hat
Yeah Im cool but you violate and Ill cock back
Open the macs mouth and black out like I do not rap
Im sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Yall be making up stories the little kids is buyin
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I aint gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong pause
Veterans cosign me the upandcomers scared
The pretty girls go papi heres my underwear
Never in a hundred years I thought Id be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew Id be a factor
Im PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
Youre Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gaps so crazy
Im Gucci Louis V youre Gap Old Navy
I get coochie in the V you attract no ladies
Youre suburb Im gutter where the gats go crazy
Fuck a lecture aint tryna be Puns successor
That terms done fucker what up whatever
You birds is food Im about to pluck some feathers
Im young and clever plus clutch under pressure yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest thatll open your chest like a sunken treasure
Im somethin like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever Im rhyming on or whoever
I tear em apart swear on my pops
No fear in my heart shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks snapped fins with my jaws
Im all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back dumb birds I ignore the hype
Clickclack Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg cross me twice cant afford the price
Itll cost you Ill off your life
You soft I told you Im raw white when Im on this mic
Still mourn at night dont wanna see mornin light
And I feel like Im forced to fight
When the CHiPs are down like Ponch fallin off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome right
I got em in awe my auras Jordan like
Whats really poppin who diddyboppin
You wasnt really now you all Common and really conscious
I aint with that silly nonsense I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggies optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave theyre carvin Fucked with the wrong nigga
I dont write I kill a pen leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin my age
Forever vow to never smile when Im at peace
Only when Im eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemys internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led em in the belly of the beast
Youll be missin until fishermen see your corpse
Ill be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
Im a gorilla behind these bars on some zoo shit
Shoot you while youre talking on some news camera crew shit
Sicker than flyin in past tense on some flu shit
Dayold asshole flow I drop new shit
Exclusive you dont want it in fact
Ill have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you leavin your body he dont wanna go back
Thats when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
Its Crooked I the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat
Nickel yeah
I hope niggas know Ill show up to your show
Ill show up where you go show up to your do foes will explode
Shells fore they hit the floor I know niggas know
I got a open window flow I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why sheeeeeeeeeeeeit
Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like OShea
Ridin shotgun with Chris Martin my DJ
Not the White boy but Im down for the Coldplay
Forever stay violent better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up clap niggas up scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it aint no mo aint no dough
Get into his ass cause I aint opposed Im a livin anal probe
Im a lameophobe matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin why the fuck not 
When I was a teen I used to pack a threeeighty
Now Im spittin sittin between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she aint shave
I leave the booth smellin like somebody aint sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I aint crazy
Im like Marty McFly goin back in time
And dissin his momma nigga you cant fade me
They say he a bastard for real then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin whys he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks I RIP it
So even to the producer its hard to ID it
Bars tremendous its in your best interest
I insist your men just do your best Bush rendish
Endless move more than two inches
My bloodll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me maana
Or see the speed of a llama underground prima donna
That aint hard to find pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E Honda he a monster
I love war its like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin hard I see vagina pause
Nah rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine manoamano
When it rains it pours grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin with Mouse the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle and an eagle eye
Closed casket now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head dudes callin you Crotchface
So yall could bump Swag Like Us
But the next time raps discussed add this as a plus
Dont nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fags might bust
And since poppin tags is a must what 
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin their drawers now your crew is in awe
How you ball your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon need another processor to process it
Ill set it I said it
So keep running around hotheaded til you get hot leaded
Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it niggas is piethetic
Rap what you cant afford yall must got credit
All you gotta know is Crooked I Royce Bless and Joell
With Joe spell NO L

5887,"Well when the moon comes up and the sun goes down
And the street lights start comin on in the town
When the kids go inside and old foks go to sleep
Thats when real Gs come out on the creep
Midnight movin through the city on the low
Sippin on some sizurp and smokin on some dro
Got the TVs on both my screens on flow
Pop trunk on dis bitch and Im ready to go
You never know what the night might hold
After hours motherfuckers act way too cold
You see work gettin bought and work gettin sold
If you real you can roll but if you fake you might fold
Now a days its a struggle to survive
Some of these dark alley ways will eat you alive
Imma grip my grain and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin
Cause we dont come out till after dark
With nothing less than 28 grams of spark
And nothing less than 16 ounces of sip
Everytime that its time to flip
You can find me
Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac
With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back
Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin
We dont give a fuck we just late night creepin
In the late night
Thats w thats w
Thats when real Gs c come out on the creep
I got my two 45s and they loaded and locked
Keep em both on cock for I step on the block
Its the grave yard shit cause we out on the grind
And we dont care about time cause its money on mind
We the first ones out tryin to get us some bread
We aint worried bout sleep fuck goin to bed
We the last ones to leave after hittin them stangs
Take it back to the boulevard with fours on swang
I do my thing and you cant tell me different
Cross the wrong line and your body might skip it
Im programmed automatic with this G shit
And that go for every other cat you see me with
Glock turned on with the burn on the hip
Im blowin on the deuce by the candy painted whip
Imma grip my grain and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin
2X
In the late night better get your face right
Everything sells bitches to the bass pipe
I seen it all eyes redder than a brake light
Blood shot 20 20 through the guage sight
Im in a gold lac bought it all from sold sacks
I aint braggin homie these are just the cold facts
We known to hold gats and nobody hold back
Fuck a cheap shot ill take out your whole back
So bring your whole pack better bring an extra clip
Aint nobody walk away cause aint nobody give a shit
Bitch Im livin and I love it its beautiful
Somethin like the smell of crap when Im watchin your noodle blow
We famous pharmisuticals and breakin the bits
We blazin two up in the cuticals to breakin the bread
Dont give a shit you never heard of us
We known among the murderous
For toatin heavy metal push the good shit pour the purple up
You can find me
Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac
With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back
Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin
We dont give a fuck we just late night creepin
",goin to bed We the last ones to leave after hittin them stangs Take it back to the boulevard with fours on swang I do my thing and you cant tell me different Cross the wrong line and your body might skip it Im programmed automatic with this G shit And that go for every other cat you see me with Glock turned on with the burn on the hip Im blowin on the deuce by the candy painted whip Imma grip my grain and cock my gun And show these mother fuckers how its done When your late night creepin 2X In the late night better get your face right Everything sells bitches to the bass pipe I seen it all eyes redder than a brake light Blood shot 20 20 through the guage sight Im in a gold lac bought it all from sold sacks I aint braggin homie these are just the cold facts We known to hold gats and nobody hold back Fuck a cheap shot ill take out your whole back So bring your whole pack better bring an extra clip Aint nobody walk away cause aint nobody give a shit Bitch Im livin and I love it its beautiful Somethin like the smell of crap when Im watchin your noodle blow We famous pharmisuticals and breakin the bits We blazin two up in the cuticals to breakin the bread Dont give a shit you never heard of us We known among the murderous For toatin heavy metal push the good shit pour the purple up You can find me Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin We dont give a fuck we just late night creepin,Well when the moon comes up and the sun goes down And the street lights start comin on in the town When the kids go inside and old foks go to sleep Thats when real Gs come out on the creep Midnight movin through the city on the low Sippin on some sizurp and smokin on some dro Got the TVs on both my screens on flow Pop trunk on dis bitch and Im ready to go You never know what the night might hold After hours motherfuckers act way too cold You see work gettin bought and work gettin sold If you real you can roll but if you fake you might fold Now a days its a struggle to survive Some of these dark alley ways will eat you alive Imma grip my grain and cock my gun And show these mother fuckers how its done When your late night creepin Cause we dont come out till after dark With nothing less than 28 grams of spark And nothing less than 16 ounces of sip Everytime that its time to flip You can find me Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin We dont give a fuck we just late night creepin In the late night Thats w thats w Thats when real Gs c come out on the creep I got my two 45s and they loaded and locked Keep em both on cock for I step on the block Its the grave yard shit cause we out on the grind And we dont care about time cause its money on mind We the first ones out tryin to get us some bread We aint worried bout sleep fuck

Dana Owens aka Queen Latifah yes Im here to testify
No I gotta speak on my behalf
You dont even know what happened
Can I just tell you what happened
Queen Latifah 
He had it comin He had it comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
Macy Gray 
I mean imagine why was he hittin his woman
Why was she takin that Now picture her fightin back
Think of the ass kickin think of his ass flippin down the stairs
And me at the top smilin he shoulda stopped wildin
Now could you picture me tryin to finish him off
See why I pictured me on this side of the law
High heels leave holes youda thought I was gunnin
Now the cops comin I aint runnin He had it comin 
Girl you shoulda seen it shoulda bobbed and weaved
Before the cops came got a couple of clean hits
In word the couldnt take the abuse
But I couldnt explain that to the state troops
But you know girl yeah you go girl
Plus I look real cute in orange jumpsuits
This the story Im tellin and I aint changin nothin
I just needed you to know Your Honor
Queen Latifah 
He had it comin He had it comin 
He only had himself to blame

 Macy Gray 
Aight aight lets get this over with
Take the mug shot hurry up the fingerprints what the blood clot
Lil Kim aka Sofia Luchiani
Keep your jumpsuit Im rockin Armani
Yeah I bust at him once but that was just a warnin
My lawyer will be here with bail money in the mornin
Im not guilty just tryin to protect mine
It aint my fault he ran into my knife 20 times He had it comin 
Just my luck the bastard aint die
What you woulda did if every other day he blacked your eye
Broke your nose til it started bleedin
Kicked you in your ribs choked you til you stopped breathin
Fuck that Im sick of bobbin and weavin
Him threatenin to kill me when I threaten to leave him
I do a bid cause aint no way
Nigga gonna do me like Ike and OJ
He had it comin Comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
He had it comin C omin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it
I think that you would have done the same
This is for the constantly accused mentally abused
How many of you been in my shoes before aight 
Or have you felt you caught the worse case
Puttin up with his tired ass in the first place
Why am I flippin I just bought them condoms
I aint used not one but there was two missin
Made a new mission how to catch a cheater
If he only use Coast you shouldnt smell Lever He had it comin 
If you know he dont smoke you shouldnt smell reefer
If you catch him cheatin you shouldnt yell either
Run up on him quietly choke him out silently
It might sound cruel but you gotta love the irony
So explain that just came back off a trip
And I come home to this please
He aint followed the guidelines
So forgive me Your Honor but he ran into my knife five times
He had it comin Comin 
He only had himself to blame
If youdve been there if youdve seen it

I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver Hey conductor you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off the bus
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine honey is that you
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you got something else to do
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin through the crowd trying to get to where shes at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine honey where are you
Seems like every time I catch you
But youre up to something new
Downtown searching for her looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
I caught a loaded taxi paid up everybodys tab
Flip the twenty dollar bill and told him catch that yellow cab
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine honey is that you
Seems like every time I catch you
Youre up to something new
She moved around like a wayward summer breeze
Go driver go go on catch her for me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear

We could hang out But not today because
I got another date and Im already late
But heres my number call me dont procrastinate
When you get home pick up the phone
Leave me with a message dont leave me with a dial tone
And when I finish hanging out with this girl tonight
Im calling you and you better act right
She said Hold it you got a lot of nerve
What makes you think you deserve
A call from me and I said Save it
If you didnt want my number you woulda gave it back to me
Right away and as I walked away under her breath I heard her say
Youve got it Ill call you later
You like the way I played her Im nothin but a player

Nothin but a player

So what Im a player playing the field

Proceed with caution without a doubt

But I wont deceive you love you or leave you
Dont tell me that you love me cause I wont believe you

You could do what you wanna do and let me be what I wanna be
And thats a player girllayer rhyme sayer

You said that I dissed you from the way I speak
Well I call em as I see emfreak
Wanna play miss prissy innocent with me
When I know what you were doing last week
Riding around all over town in and out of cars
Now how that sound
You got a hundred beeper numbers in one phone book
And been with every other guy in town
If a guy has a hundred girls hes a hero
A girl with a hundred guys is a zero
Dont blame me that society made the rule
But I think they made it for me
Varieties are right for me but ladies in the place
Dont you even try to be
A player thats my JOB and Im playing it to the T
Im nothin but a player
Aint no trick Im nothin but a player

914,"Oh God its raining but Im not complaining
Its filling me up with new life
The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes
Theyre lighting my way tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
Just for a day on a day like today
Ill get away from this constant debauchery
The wind in my hair makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
But theyre not like tonight
Oh God its raining and Im not containing
My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own all on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
Id been mistaken for dead
But not tonight
",in the sky Reminding me of so many other nights But theyre not like tonight Oh God its raining and Im not containing My pleasure at being so wet Here on my own all on my own How good it feels to be alone tonight And I havent felt so alive In years The moon is shining in the sky Reminding me of so many other nights When my eyes had been so red Id been mistaken for dead But not tonight,Oh God its raining but Im not complaining Its filling me up with new life The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes Theyre lighting my way tonight And I havent felt so alive In years Just for a day on a day like today Ill get away from this constant debauchery The wind in my hair makes me so aware How good it is to live tonight And I havent felt so alive In years The moon is shining

But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers thats known to break em off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent front and back glass got tint
Tryin to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools cant hold us
Every chance we get we hittin up the rollers
Comin up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin bean pies
Or the bootleg tshirt of the month
With U Cant Touch This on the front
Im out to get rich
Cause life aint nothin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didnt know Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
Im out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
Cause Im ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch cause Im steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Bustin caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause Im gettin major
Fuck PacTel move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Dont drink 8Ball cause St Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad tempers are flarin
Cause they got a few bitches starin
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss em
Out cause I just dont trust em
And if you tell on me Im bombin on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
Steady mobbin
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life
There goes the neighborhood
Since onetime so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
Cause Im rollin on rims
Eating soul food neckbones from MMs
Grubbin like a motherfucker
Greasyass lips now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin
When I hit a left on Ruthelen What up loc
Dont you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke Get in nigga
Ill take you to the pad soon
Went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bones house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob aint nothin but tramps
For hoes lickin nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I dont want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash
I said Yeah but I dont play sex
Without puttin on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night no longer steady mobbin

Im offended by these authentic liars
Shouldve been retired let me identify them
Youll never get me quiet my people been inspired
Im the little fire flickering within the riot
Feel it vibrate shake awake sleeping giant
Keep them vibrant and vital and reenergize them
Our times arriving our shine is blinding
They cry were violent demonize it
Guys on the wrong side of right find us frightening
Pray lightning strike twice ice on their eyelids
Isis Osiris Christ in his likeness
Day of resurrection bring life to the lifeless
Tear the wall down pull a crown of a tyrant
Rebuild gentrify the planet for the righteous
He who sacrifices for the greater good
Elevate them where they should to the title of your highness

United by the mighty human life tie that bind us
Hunger find kindness minds find refinement

Lord hold me close dont let me go
Oh thank you master for my soul
Lord hold me close dont let me go
The long suffering long for relief
The hard working meek still drowned in grief
Houses are seized and they tossed in the street
The orphans of greed in the culture of deceit
Strong hunt the weak and the poverty steep
Wages dropping beneath yet the cost still increase
Officers deep keep force of police
The fourheaded beast wild all off the leash
Hardhearted beast with a jaw full of meat
Engulfed in a feast while you starve at his feet
He toss you the least little portion of a piece
To the floor and expect you to rejoice when you eat
Survival can seem the impossible feat
But you roll up your sleeves and you sow all your seeds
Toil in the soil but youre not allowed to reap
So you toss and you scream like a horrible dream
Woke out your sleep got you forced to your feet
Feel the pulse of your people in the heart when it beat
The vultures they keep bringing halt to your peace
Pull the sword out the sheath keep the wolves off of the sheep

Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he wont be down on Wall Street
In the morning
He had a home
The love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes
As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesnt matter anymore
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Lying here in the darkness
I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency
Somebodys going to jail
If you find somebody to love in this world
You better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
Things can get pretty strange
In a New York Minute
Everything can change
In a New York Minute
And in these days
When darkness falls early
And people rush home
To the ones they love
You better take a fools advice
And take care of your own
One day theyre here
Next day theyre gone
I pulled my coat around my shoulders
And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark
Baby Ive changed Please come back
What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
But I know theres somebody somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear
Until that day I have to believe
I believe I believe

6991,"I couldnt help but notice your pain
My pain
It runs deep share it with me
Theyll never take me alive Im gettin high with my fourfive
Cocked on these suckas time to die
Even as a youngster causin ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin up dust
But now Im labeled as a troublemaker who can you blame
Smokin weed helped me take away the pain
So Im hopeless rollin down the freeway swervin dont worry
Im bout to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me what should I do
I had to feed my fuckin family what else could I do
But be a thug Out slangin with the homies
Fuck hangin with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger never been a stranger to homicide
My citys full of gangbangers and drivebys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse mind full of sick thoughts
And I aint goin back to court so fuck what you thought
Im drinkin Hennessy runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be 23 Theres so much pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Years and years of that rough life
Runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife
And livin trifed on the regular buckin out competitors
See em fake a move and chase em down like the fuckin Predator
Get in trouble every day in school act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin off for the bitches cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop pop pop and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo currency kept passin me by but I didnt cry broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin coke
And now the moneys lookin lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick em the game its all the same
I kick it back yo give em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman you heard man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn At least Im realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo ass twisted so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan kickin major dust
So if you owe nigga look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame its a deep game
And my mama always cryin yo theres so much pain
Ohhhh
So tired so tired
Ohhhh
Soso
They got me mobbin like Im loced and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I aint scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck cause I aint lookin when Im bblastin
Im a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Dont wanna die tell me why Cause this stress is gettin major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until Im dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
Im real they cannot see and every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin on the streets and Ill be ballin loc
Dont let em make you worry keep swingin at these suckas til you buried
I was born to raise hell a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother Im touched
Out kickin dust up ready to bust
Im on the scene steady muggin mean until they kill me
Ill be livin this life I know you feel me theres so much pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain

Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot

See I will leave you to rot only defendin my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop while I harvest the crop

When Im having fun you know I cant conceal it
Cause I know youd never cut it in my game oh no

You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair collagen lip injections

Id like to crush your head tight in my vice

8162,"I got bored with 4 beats to the measure
Professor speech compressor terminated his tenure to explore more rewarding adventure
Take a closer look at the bars
Youll see Im not behind them or in front of them Im one of them
Started with a 100 the Game spit 3 I said Fuck it
Ima have to show these niggas something
Too easy whod believe me if I said that it wasnt
The rhyme is a weapon I bust it the Brotherhood got me covered
OP orders with coordinates where to drop mortars
I drive forward sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as AGCR
The rhymes are raw deeper than yours
You crawled before you walked but didnt think about your thoughts before you talked
We spit for sport I won you lost
But you paid them off to nail my corpse to a cross
This is The Greatest Rhyme of All Time supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
Mentally top heavy not many can rock with me
Hip Hop could not bench me so they plot to suspend me
I said Nobody benefits everyone perishes
I tell them this they say Here its time for your medicine
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for stepping over the line
When I inspired Hova and Nas
I listened to 44 4s 22 times
I Gave You Power God stop my heart if Im lying
You like red or white wine Lets talk about it Im buying
Lets talk about the Children of Zion excuse me if I start crying
The art of rhyming Ive mastered it certainly surely
Ill celebrate capturing it for my taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To the jungles of Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
The Ice Truck Killer will be observing me perform surgery
Ritual widow murder searching for her urgently
Mix the blood so it dont coagulate
The sex magik wont work if the bitch masturbates
I put her on cloud nine look at her face
A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space
You will become acquainted with my cryptic language
And my mystic manners Rip spit bananas
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility
Most MCs try to clone me lyrically
My cell chemistry is a mirror of who I am physically
But my true symmetry is energy
The Will of Claude Ashur
The skill of GermaineFather Author Poor Pauper Pastor more than a rapper
My body is a human machine my dreams filter in between
Just wait until I build my machine
Kill you with weed vapour then a taser then a laser
Then a maser then a phaser then something they call scalar
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
But why Coup de grce for the coup dtat
In a man made lodge the Moon rays replace God
I think Ive had about enough of your tough talk
Come over here take my cuffs off I promise you well just talk
No biting allowed just bark dont run just walk
Battle Rap there is no such art
Emotion manifests thought thought manifests words actions and reality
This is not fantasy
If you question me you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Blacklist Registry
Im a scruffy old man with bloody cold hands
On my arm is a tattoo of a sully old brand
If I am not myself then how would I be
If I do not look tell me how will I see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The laws of poetry in action is practiced quite actively
I look at my face more than anybody else
I still cant recognize myself
I dont need anybody but myself
When Im rhyming like this I dont need no help
But thank you for your purchase these verses have perennial purpose
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
At least from my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious the more apprehensive the sentence
You are lazy you wanna be the best you crazy
The best train every day of the week
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
Rip the Jacker spitting inside Zero Vector Systems
Brain waves reveal High Yield ED Fields
Chew MCs like Im eating a meal
A bunch of fake niggas tryna keep it pseudo real
A bunch of fake King Midas with fools gold grills
My microphone was found where the Mayan Sun Stone was
The Period of Purification in my poems
Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome under red rock
Its no use if you cant use what you got
Buried in a mass grave covered in bones
My cell phone numbers placed on their tombstones
Your girl Gertrude promised me her servitude
She better do it I dont wanna have to hurt you dude
I eat from the same portion as you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
A deer hunter all year if I could spare summers
Fucking your whore of a mother in front of her queer husband
Wide lens wide mattress shes an actress
This is Monster Ball practice Im Big Billy Bob Black Angus
You and I can sit and look at each other
Tossing knowledge back and forth like we was throwing books at each other
I dont care if were not the same colour nigga Im your brother
I dont care what you say nigga you a nigga lover
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind waves bars and rhymes
Motivated by the stars that shine
Only lower density life forms get lost in time
I dont care if I make history I wanna be a part of infinity
Look at what your Sun god did to me
I am energy I am He spiritually and mentally
The fools who threw away my jewels offended me
As we walk through the archived files of all styles
The East Wing Isle goes on for five miles
More rappers than fans more fans wrapped in vans
Hip Hop will continue to expand
Poets should be rappers rappers should be lyricists
The current industry model collapse imminent
This is Hollywood Hip Hop
Celebrities adopt little snot nosed bugaboos from off the block
Larry King Live earthquake right outside
I looked that squarely shouldered man square in his eye
Poetically paralyzing where are you Are you hiding
No I am sandbag diving
Do not evade question
Please explain to your viewers how there are space weapons bigger than Zeppelins
How is it so Tell the people they need to know
And if you dont think so youre a talk show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who could tell me that this poem is luck
You say Im crazy I say So tell me something I dont know
Something my psyche profile doesnt show
I dont have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
The substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus Answer me
I approached the podium and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit they dont like when I bust
The mucus dried up to a pear like crust
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
Food supply low they speak of going above ground to find mo
I cry out No do not go
Where the fuck are you going
400mph wind belts blowing think for a moment
We got to wait it out thats what the trainings about
We have to survive thats what Germaine is about
Arctic geography is conducive to astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies follow me
The sheer size of the academia implied by the rhymes
Lead them to believe I was lying
I blasted through the limestone with water mixed with a dissolver
Then I signalled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage battle the hardest
Take out Hip Hops trash and garbage
Tunnel boring and jacking water main tapping
I sat there drafting a new drainage plan laughing
Tough pliable relatively reliable
The vocation of this undertaking is very viable
My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue
I cant rest until I accomplish what I was sent to do
The gross oversimplication of a Jamaican
In a basement tracing over diagrams for a tape deck
That evolved into a spaceship that hasnt been made yet
Cause I havent been paid yet not even one pay check
I walked through the valley of humiliation
But Hip Hop started hating I tried to save them they wasnt patient
Responsibility entrusted
Theres only one way for me to prove that I love it thats why Im busting
If you pursue revenge dig many graves
Be sure to add your name to the list that youve made
Musically still producing I got a couple new things cocooning
But Poet Laureates my new shit
Distinguished English and sophisticated senses
In sync with the talisman I received from the temptress
With these lyrics I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it concentrate you can hear it
Ive almost perfected this Im one word away from excellence
When I find it Ill begin testing it
The phenomenal beast astronomer priest
When the poles shift the Sun will not rise from the East
Wilder than the wilderness Im bout to show you
Who wildebeest Williams is you better be filming this
A blast so cataclysmic it warps the time and space within it
The hours become minutes
The minutes become infinite lyrics
Poet Laureate spit from the spirit from the Sirius Star system
To observe the gods
My thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity listen to the bars
The Kapellmeister in the battle grinder created by King Osiris
My psychic wall larger than Chinas
The thirst to rhyme at first hurts like a laborious childbirth
And sounds like Chinese fireworks
Several million years into the past
A primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Focus on two standards when assessing the threat
Number 1 is capacity Number 2 is intent
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles for survival
Always remember meet me in Denver
Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg welcome center
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes all the time
I perform a requiem on the eve before Hip Hop ends
And make amends on behalf of my friends
Canibus grab the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you cant forget
Oprah Winfrey dont like rap
All I got to say about that is she probably dont like black
I dont blame her she dont understand its only entertainment
She probably wouldnt feel different if she wasnt famous
She traded places and her opinions started changing
As Randolph and Mortimer increased her wages
That alone could make a person racist if not racist with colour
Then material wise how we treat each other
The head of a lion the legs of an eagle
The wings of a dragon not the sigil this is for real though
I sit down and think when I write I can smell the ink
I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
The ideas have come from God even Im stunned
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
I heard Hip Hop was dead thats not fair
Who I talk to Go he there Nasir
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
I procured a small piece of the treasure collections from a former era
Dating back to forever the warrior became protector
Quoted from the book of the law I dont govern them
I summon them speaking in tongues again
Started with a trumpet woodwinds strings
The conductor brings the drums in finger trigger the drum kit
Other MCs be nervous or something
Rhymes in abundance Hip Hop justice rappers are captured and punished
Drawn and quartered liars are denied water you still alive
I repeat in a revised order
My skull is a submarine hull
Screen doors protect the motherboard core from extreme heat warp
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon trident seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinaras Trench detour to Ultima Thule let me explain what my sonar saw
Upholding the Holy Rosary patrolling the open seas at UBoat speed
Beneath the Tsunami where Im supposed to be
Industrialists civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs aristocrats in the buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
The clinical professor of rhymes from Pepperdine
Cosigned by GlaxoSmithKline designs
The Universe provided the lighting to see what I was writing
The results were blinding lyrics timing
Shut the fuck up and stop whining
Instinct controls how you think before deciding so keep vibing
Swimming naked in the open a lone shark circles me
Instead of trying to murder me it tried to flirt with me
I got away nervously talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it its going to have a word with me
I guess it wasnt meant to be
Under an assumed identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made field grade steel face
Moving at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
I am not here to negotiate
Eliminate the face on the photograph we have in our database
No emcee could rhyme like this theres no challenge
His Poet Laureateship pontificates balance
This lyrical pyramid was discovered by accident
I know I could build it faster if I block and tackle it
Judge me fairly
Compare me to Dante Alighieris Purgatorio theory
Assigned to train and equip to spit whos ready
Ill need a volunteer do I have any
Next year Ill get my SPINGS a master space badge
After that Ill stop flying fixed wing aircraft
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Worm screw elevators descending to the bottom of the volcano crater
Inside the Devils chamber
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The leaders lies got me reassigned my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
One ought not to think is what Rumsfeld thought
Im a take you for a walk through a beautiful place called Honey Swamp
Well shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
The whirlpool of gravity traps me
Still allowing me to circle the M51 galaxy
Rap for me reduces the stress dramatically
Negative time produces antigravity
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
Watch me wet up your weed then bust up you teeth
Make you run for your life like theres a bus up the street
The Dr and I would meet at 29 palms Joshua street
I always had a lot to debrief
Killing my health killing myself
Rebuilding myself nobody feel what I felt
Modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill getting more ill
The woman who is there she will take care of you
With Nexium Avodart Lipitor and Theraflu
Rap music profession immunosuppressants
One question per second One answer per session
Hip Hop made me Hip Hop praise me
Aint nothing changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy battle me baby
1000 Bars nigga after that maybe
Murder murder murder kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill but now I chill
An asteroid field where every rock shaped like my seal
I do it for the civilians I do it for the soldiers
Raptors Comanches Strykers Cobras
Back at the TOC with GW Prescott
Grid location missile lock lift up the block
I gotta spit til the story is told
Its a gift this story is a part of my soul
We shouldnt keep fighting the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth then where we gon go
Starving in destitution dying for retribution
Why would you wanna blow a hospital You stupid
Why would you not force yourself to make better music
Our now fruitless creations used to be in abundance
Like something harder than Tungsten break your arm if you punch it
I ride on a flatbed chariot 4 ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter the Lovecraft craft lover
Quoting my favourite Inventor I see excitement coming
I raise my hand lightening bolts stream from it
I see excitement coming I see excitement coming
Unsatisfied I decide to redefine rhyme
To create product of an applied mind
They say were divided I say were small minded
Right after I said it I moved to a small island
There was no contingency plan given to me
Tell the motherfucker send his transcripts to me
Swear your allegiance the tuition is free
To be a mini me version with minor abilities
783 hertz from the Earth magnified
Signal Intelligence emanating from your mind
At the observatory summit of Mt Graham
Looking through this starlight scope in my hand
Beautiful longitudinal musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shutting your mouth
Surprisingly got The John Campbell award for writing
By summarizing that rhyming can be dehumanizing
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic ultra electro and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone
You cannot comfort me like my poems
1000 BARS put me in the zone
The Pope shook they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
Salute I would like to propose this next toast
To maturation barrels I carved from French Oak
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Corruption is necessary but tell me whos the beneficiary
Which one of us will sing Hail Mary
Hip Hop supposed to be about endurance
But every time you rhyme not just when Im touring
Acupuncture point or plus is not enough
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
The facts too acute to repute or debate
My face is a slim sleek gas mask shape
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
The window is closing from the other side it looks like its opening
Where am I trying to go with this
Fire and Ash fallout thats what its all about
We must construct a shelter and then build a wall around it
All the parents want to do is look at the body but
It wont happen til AFTER the official autopsy
A good psychological environment for science
Im memorizing visualizing peace and quiet
Father Author Poor Pauper has poor posture
As filthy as the collar of a dirty grave robber
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
The coral reef is changing from green to amber
Scientist scramble to come up with new answers
The truth is well within my sphere of pursuit
But Im unprepared to take action just like you
The innate need for Canibus to be professional
Make it difficult indeed for me to connect with you
Greetings and salutations my equations are inundated with information
Electro cranial stimulation
Burn skin off face burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofing remediation
Any and ALL entry points have immigration
One meter beside the Hubble outside the bubble the effects of gravity on my
Muscles were quite subtle
I do what I want to do I have always been that way
Because I have always thinked that way
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future
Pulsating lights and sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats layered underneath lyrics
250 thousand cycles per second for Dolphin hearing
The electrical optical coupling Gear is effective
88 Kilometres above the planet
My rhymes harness a power beyond your understanding
The Gods began to call me I looked up
Stars fell towards me and scorched me to a metaphor freak
The authentic Command Doctrine of George Washington
Himself GW Im positive its him
I proof read my writtens eat a chicken with the skin missing
Spend the whole night out binge drinking
Executive Director of Civic Participation spitting
First it was vote or die Now its dont vote Why
Weed is now legalized are you high
Rhymes compartmentalized seperatized to prevent bootlegging pirates
Be my guest keep trying
The bird chirps dying in the dirt because the earth is hurt
But not before I start cursing first
Not so fast Mr Iconoclast
If you dont leave the bottle outside you cant pass
Gather the evidence then give it to the President
Dont reprimand him ask him for help next 190
A lamp with no electrode will not glow
We need some new bright ideas that we did not know
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You must take prudent and precautionary measures
I think of rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I cant wait to sign an autograph for the last time
A Luciferian web everyday we are burying dead
Every colour in America bled
Empirical evidence of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
Youll never reach the end of it 200
Fire and forget rhyme for respect
I didnt get that so I wrote Poet Laureate
The Hubble Space Telescope images changed Bis
And nothing on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
Music is my bread and butter why should I suffer
My publicist said she could get me the TIME LIFE cover
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined cause Im familiar what greed can do
I can not lose or win
I would only like to be remembered as the dark skinned Lizard King
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
Let it be said let it be written let it be done
Publicly coming forward with my metaphors to share
About the space serpents flying around in the troposphere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This never been done before in history
I spit at a thousand KIPS kilo tons of pressure
Every letter is measured in such a way you will remember
December 21st 2012 is the code
It was placed on the sunstone to puzzle them
Starting with some numbers the code crackers start crunching
I better have some results by the months end
Really Deep Blue computes deeply and does it
What is the answer to Universe Read me the numbers
In the summer the Polar Manitobas melted by lava
A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
The Rear Admirable participated in battle every war and at least half of my
Crew were injured every tour
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force would give us
All what we needed we were wrong
Canibus is notably known Globally
My verbal sorcery somehow talks to the beat
Lyrically you not ready dress right dress
Not messy my muscle memory make me bomb squad steady
You cant contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes ears nose throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
Recite 33 3s 33 times
For 24hrs 21 thousand Nautical miles
Ahead of my lifetime I write and recite rhymes
Deja Vu in the booth is the truth when you apply it
Devine design a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
From the shores of Normandy to the Turkish streets
To the bluest oceans glowing on the Persian beach
Nuclear Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat then mix my spit with the mercury
The DJ grabs the acetate out the crate
Mix the dub plate the BPMs fluctuate
Nobody can hold me back my flow bloviates to a spiritual shape
As I cocreate rap 30
Cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smoking a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
The target appears in brackets I attack it
Access then egress then quit this rap shit
Commander of the symphony when man meets ministry
Finishing my Archeogenetic Rap Facility
They cant battle me so theyd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me they commit microphone heresy
I am still the Master
As handsome as my unborn Grandson Rip The Jacker
Call me grandpa 40 as odd as it may seem
The microphone fiend is God of the Hip Hop regime
Planet Rock Supreme
Kill you with green Lasers evaporated weed vapour Electromagnetic Scalar
Then something they call a Maser
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Meteors fall from the sky The Mars God looks at my eyes
Controlling my heart controlling my mind
Oh Lord Tell me what to do Tell me oh Lord
I have mastered the art of rhyming I am so bored
My pain my joy my thoughts Ive passed them on thru songs
Respond to me and I will answer to your call
Emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions Reality
Thats how it has to be
In front of me on both sides and in back of me
I hear them talk about battling me in the whispering gallery
The chain of command blames the unseen hand
The Galactic Plane has a Galactic Plan
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorie come to me 60
Sitting down at the mixing boardroundbanquet table comfortably
They begin to study me by showing me worlds I would love to see
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I could move about freely I rose I fell
The coldness of heaven is like the coldness of hell
Metaphoric Sun Worship pulling me with planet like inertias
Words blinking like the text edit cursor
My sentences are sometimes too sensitive to make sense of it
Layer upon layer upon layer unedited
You lazy you wanna be the best You crazy
The Best Train EVERYDAY of the week
Propulsion system is gravity driven white hot thermal
External vision every lyric got a wormhole in it
Saint Germaine is real Germaine is a sage for real
My sigil is the double headed eagle seal
Normal life is not real we are cogs in a wheel
We work we hurt we search we feel
The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics
Circular motion in both the para and the hyperbolas
Tiger Woods knows this everytime he plays golf he shows this
A true master at the masters in focus
In my time of need I am not alone
I was told in a dream by Cthulhu from his tomb
Try to hurt me Ill murder you lay you down vertical
Made your life purposeful germinated the earth with you
My black goggles are covered with Bat Guano
Ill hang from the ceiling and watch you act hostile Ill pop you
Rap Music and those who listen to it dont owe me nothing
I dont want nothing from you not even your judgement
The Philosophic maverick the massive knowledge magnet
Underwater sea lilies are the source of my magic
Matricidal motherfucker homicidal hustler
Filibuster never been a Wikipedia lover
If I were you I wouldnt waste time reading that rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet but fuck it
Leviathan divides the suspect zero sign
Therefore I rhyme for all time
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Unnatural battle ability the enemy tried to imprison me
But they wouldve been better off killing me
Theoretically Shiaperrelli has mentored me
With motifs of illuminated speech and wizardry
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
Sound pours out of the ground across the land
Jethro Tull was mauled by the god called Pan
Creative writing and rhythm grammar and composition
Dont ignore me ignore the fool who tells you not to listen
To you it shouldnt sound like Im quitting cause Im not
If I am to continue its up to Hip Hop
Weary of body and mind tired of swimming against the tide
Why swim or walk when I can glide
Zero Gravity exercising requires expert timing for sky diving
My call sign is Flying Wing
An impossible profession
St Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message
Now you may go
You have graduated now you may know
Tell the world exactly what you were shown
Sho nuff sesame street poems brought to you by Sears Roebuck
Countdown 48 more months
Does it amaze me NO Does it phase me maybe a little yo
Gotta find a way to generate doe
Promoter wont pay me what I want for a show
Why do it for free when Im worth my weight in gold
Mind Body Soul inseparable incredibly
Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually
Hip Hop became boring lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ
But they should be more important
The diaphragm the thymus
Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras
You get the Guantanamo Bay the Alcatraz way
You heard what I say These pigs gotta pay
I steady my approach this supposed to be a no fly zone
Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes
The hurricanes eyes open
Gale winds blowing Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean
I figured out how to save water in a drought
If we save the right amount I know we can make it out
The ever expanding mind commanding body do you copy
The quantum biology biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
Even when you press rewind your still left behind
Father Author Poor Pauper breaths to draw Prana
In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama
Your ear cartilage has been targeted The bombing will commence
Dont be a bitch nigga you started it
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
Drawing mathematics suspended in space as holographics
Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style its like trying to ride a bull
The lyrical inimical is miserable because Ive built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Am I a mad man or a mason A patriot or a pagan
West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons
The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated
Im waiting on the parts special order replacements
Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment
Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites Fuck all the haters
My luck was crushed I felt like they fronted
My heart kept pumping I had to do something
I turned the page wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal XRays they say I dont burn I blaze
Dont look at it like winning or losing in 98 it was amusing
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit
Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping
But right now my image stands still in a prism
My light reflects like a mirror I choose to share it
The Precession of Earth is nearing Im preparing
Assessment and Planning things should I put mustard on these sandwiches a
Fathers job is so challenging
My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease
You cant Emcee take a seat
What are you building Bis Is it a flying Silver Disk
If you ever leave youll be missed
I tear thru the Galactic drift I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes
Now thats some shit You think thats fast Nah
Thats faster than you think By the time you blink the whole Universe shrinks
A word to the wise try to keep your eyes in the skies
And try to keep your ears on my rhymes
A magic reminder that the fire will not expire
Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when Im tired
The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt Im forced to look downward
Now I see inside the Earth
I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass
But it wont last were killing her with greenhouse gas
You said the best shouldnt have to ask for respect
Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES
I hold Hip Hop responsible
Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles
Gone til November Ill be gone forever
I made these bars so you could ALL remember
The illest MC to put it all on the line
My career was crucified but Im still alive
Sky scraper spaceships wide crater dry lake beds
resistance is futile they said
I bear clutch the pen my girlfriends jealous again
So intimate when I write its a sin 200
My electromagnetic rap flytrap
Theres no way Earth you can get around that
This is a no brainer stop the complaining
If Hip Hop is dead Im here to save it
Pages upon pages everything Ive created
The bar was below basic I had to raise it
I did it for my Fathers I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
My poetry is peaceful aggressive but regal
Progressive to the people I hope the words reach you 210
Dr Watson and Crick found an 3rd strand in the DNA helix
So your not what you think
Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum
The beat is my slave and it will behave as I want
Cheers I spill beer on my bear skin chairs
I shed tears I loved Hip Hop all these years
Poet Laureate Infinity
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
Nobody do it better there aint a truer Ripper
I did this separate imagine what we could do together
Inspired by GOD inspired by the suffering
Was it done by a prophet It must have been who was it then
Rip The Jacker hot but cold blooded
Many utter the name but very few love him
33 is the number that enlightens the Brothers
Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest
The ramifications are awesome what should we call it
I call it my unacknowledged special access project
My skull is a submarine hull
In a cave below ground with a painting of Cthulhu on the wall
Necronomicon grimoires open the doors
The vortex that reaches from here to beyond10
The power to control thoughts however remotely
Through a term Id like to call Pulse Detonation Poetry
The results from SETI very interesting
I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testing
My team was credited we turned over the evidence
But not before I could leverage it for promotion to President
Cover me 8 point sighting device for the eyes
FIRE Transition if you go dry
Close your eyes ritualize spit your rhymes
Without trying you can shift your mind
Canibus altered the sequence nucleotides
Neuropetides only get high off mature Wine
Start timing Atomic Clock keeps time perfectly 20
Mrs Guutoff my band teacher always would work me
Polyester pants big fat ass
I loved that woman so much I paid attention in class
My Spanish teacher Mrs Booker had an ass too
Why am I talking about this to you
One day this will be known for now I must wait
I still love them both and I never forget a face
At the time I used my Beta waves more than my Theta waves
Then there was greater way I learned at a later date
The rate of learning began burgeoning and wouldnt let up 30
Mommy noticed my vocabulary I developed
Telencephalon olfactory lobes I had to practice
When a woman has her period I smell it on the mattress
It got to be difficult for any woman to live with me
I know my history but what could that mean specifically
The story of Bruce Lee I died in my sleep
I was weak it happens with every girl that I meet
A Clairvoyant Technique
Using XRay refraction Not only can I see into the future
I can see past it 40
But I dont know what it means I pass the DataStream along to my team
They say its more than a dream
Killing caused by poisonous vapours Lasers Tasers Masers
Electromagnetic Scalars
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
Listen to the rhymes the rhymes equal pie
If I had a piece of the pie I could buy Dubai
Rip The Jacker was born the bow was drawn
Spit a 100 bars before you could run 100 yards 50
I seen a mushroom to the north from my porch
It was odd every dog in the neighbourhood barked
You wanna stand there and talk
The blast wave gonna tear more than your roof off nigga Cmon
It is my understanding that when Im high Im channelling
But when Im out with the family I am animal handling
Observe a man who has a third DNA strand
Or a 5th or a 6th this is way more advanced
I remove the veil from in front of me suddenly
The roots of my discovery uncovered skulduggery 60
I am not innocent but you cannot punish me
Cause I know what the world wants to see tragedy
What is Germaine determined to ascertain for his self
Few of the same ilk have known what I felt
Theres a Proverb that goes One should know thyself
Before one can know the world so I showed myself
The unidentified submersible looked like a giant turtle half circle
Yo I need to stop smoking purple
Requested selected elected but thats only impressive to the experts
Who know how to manipulate my message 70
You lazy and you wanna be the best I repeat
Dont talk about consciousness when you are consciousless and weak
If I die and YOU happen to wake up Im still alive
Please explain my complete life story to my children
Photo stills of the cryospill
Solarized film revealed there was a biofield
Fuck a record deal my training is real
Look at the sword I wield you will taste my steel
Phase I sign the MOU pursue more voters
Theres three more phases that I think you should know 80
Phase II build the force Phase III sustain Ops
Phase IV transition of Border Patrol Cops
Do Re Mi Fa Sol La SiDo
These are the tones that will activate the ohms
No telling if it will bring out the best or the worst in you
It would be a miracle if I was merciful
Are you food for the moon Or are you in the mood for doom
Furniture moves when I walk into a room
STRYKER BRIGADE Driver sometimes I was GUNNER
Check points required all the concentration I could muster 90
Special Weapons And Tactics Professional Assassin
I dont know what he does for a living ask him
I kneel before Congress and beg for money
Submitting specifics about the operation Im running
You gotta love it what was it called The G8 Summit
Never heard of it no details are public
The relative radiance of the rhyme makes it shine
Increasing the star wattage with longer cycle time
Yeah I bust the rhymes but I customize the lines
And by the looks of things I did it just in time 100
I marched from the Halls of Montezuma to Tripoli
Physically this mission objective is killing me
I submit to the will of the creator willingly
The possibilities present a probable infinity
I looked into LLs eyes we both cried
Meteors immediately fell from the skies
Ive apologized but I cant change who I am
I can change future cant budge the past
Them pretty ass lyrics is for bitches with acrylic
Only fake niggas catch feelings over silly shit 110
SPORTS locked and loaded zero you in from the pillbox
Williams How many kills you got
The uniforms match so we all look the same from the sky
They only time they notice the difference is when we die
Is dying a wise thing What about trying
What about our family members back home crying
Man made weapons Star Ship Captain etc
George Lucas showed me a full size replica
We circled for a fly over in a black KIOWA
5 soldiers including me and a pilot called Noah
He passed over a top secret dossier folder half opened 120
I noticed the words MOSES and CONUS
MOSES is a new weapon system secret code
CONUS is the continent of the US I suppose
The jump light lit up Master Chief said Lets Go
All right men this is what we train for
Williams you gotta go first if you say so HALO High Altitude Stay Low
Gale Winds blowing this might be the death of me
The AIRBORNE unit in the back of me jumped out next to me
Gold chords from the organ cut down your swordsman
Tell everybody to shut the fuck up when Im talking 130
Not in current version fuel mix rich human hydrogen slush
The rhymes are too Christ Complex like for them
The 1000 Bar race at an unrelenting pace
Just in case Humans ever get to World War 8
Do you believe in fate Then how do you know
When you finally get there where will you go
This aint no joke you think Im joking
Everything frozen melted destroyed broken
Only the chosen find a way out
Everybody move out Stay off the main route 140
Satellites watch me they think they got me
Right hands turn left shoulders around but its not me
Atmospheric Reentry a flying sighting looked like lightening
Striking blind what it struck was frying
Comparative image sharpness between all artists
I dont think you know what youre about to get involved in
Ill give a quadrillion dollars to be a partner
If you are still worshipping money you are Godless
Sulphuric Nitric Acid eats through the Labyrinth
The foundation is cracking we must take action 150
Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth BIBLE
I take shelter in an old Missile Silo
Hip Hop is blackened pot placed next to a kettle
With my logo in it a rigid rehomogenized metal
Millions of you are unfamiliar with what Im saying
Discuss it with your Chemistry Professor he will praise it
Tri Quad Quintangulate where did the signal originated
Try to find out more information
The internal atheist outside the MATRIX
Sophia Stewart offered me a pill and said take this
She asked me if I was followed I told her I wasnt
I didnt know the spy that sold me out would be my own cousin
A populace uniformed is a populace of slaves
Washington didnt say it quite that way
But its something like that you get the point Im assuming
Poet Laureate Exclusive New Shit
The message said We should meet somewhere clandestine
Professor keep heading East to the Best Western
Do not loose your bearings keep checking your direction
Start Session point 666 arc seconds
The budget is huge I have doubts about spending it
Concerning Cyclotronic Resonance patents are pending it
Canibus aka The Spitzberg Beast
Gave his Bicentennial Speech on Emerald Peak
Youll need a first aid kit for the verse I spit
I am cautiously meticulous but artfully brisk
A change is beginning every molecule is spinning
Lyrics imitate the art art imitates lyrics can you hear it
Signals bounce back and forth like a mirror
With flawless error like that forever
Surface the air radar tells me where they are 180
Are they far I patiently watch the sweep arm
We can find them but they cant find us
Just below Mach 3 the rhymes ionizes
Im hooked on Hip Hop I cant live without it
You can mix this song a thousand ways I dont doubt it
The daughters of man locked in prison camps
With the sons of mothers that are too weak to dance
At least we notice damage what do we expect
The coming super storm is gonna wipe us off the map 190
But that is not possible thats sounds completely illogical
You mustve been kicked the fuck out of school
Always remember the Reptilian agenda
No Pulse Rendered in the earthquakes epicentre
I found fluoride in my water supply
At the time I felt a total apathy towards dying
The ungrateful dead reoccurring images playing in my head
I was told to memorize what I was said
With this salt I consecrate this water
May whatever it touch receive Hallowed LIGHT from THEM
With this sacred water I consecrate this Talisman so that
It will make ME POET LAUREATE otherwise Ill be so depressed oh well no
Regrets I been toe to toe with the best I KNOW the LEDGE
I accept all cultures colours creeds and races
Life is Life no taxonomical classification
No corruption no disruption no destruction no budget no nothing
Its never that easy you just gotta trust it
A leader I feel beleaguered to teach the truth
The Youth will refuse to follow if they dont believe you
There is strength in numbers there are numbers in strength
Nothing good comes from hatred Loves the missing link
Even if I am in a minority of one
The truth is still the truth no matter how its spun
My mind is prepared Hip Hop is impaired
If you disagree with me then yours isnt there
I rock rhymes for your pleasure you listen at your leisure
I only record it once you listen to it forever
The fish hook stuck in your jaws the feedback was not positive
Human Hominids fishing for compliments
Started with a nugget the budget snowballed into something
Above ground running not underground covered
Breath easy regulate the pace see if they love it
The Poet Laureate puppet with a message from THE OTHERS
The aura describes the forces
Im too involved to divorce it my internal compass points me northward
My skull is a submarine hull calling whales with whale song
Creating basketball size hailstorms
Water World under water war protected by the Jericho wall
With surface permutation of the permafrost
My war birds are grounded their wings have been burned off
Im not concerned though its only the first lost
Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry Poetry
Poet Laureate infinity now you know its me
Yeti riding a Triceratops with Elephant netting
Attending Black Widow weddings dressing in gossamer webbing
Pretending experimenting they call me a heretic
A derelict cherubim seraphim protecting America
Height weight eye colour skeletal structure was designed
I circle my flight instructors in the skies as they fly
22 times to show them I have plenty new rhymes
Poet Laureate will prove it to you all in due time
Dont be upset with Canibus yet the kid just want respect
You been a success but what do he get
Politics and Perjury bring out the worst in me
But I dont take it personally even though its hurting me
The key maker turns the key those observing me keep cursing me
They arent worthy of a word from me
I spit the truth Rip the mic Rip the booth Rip you too
Rip the Jacker is proof I Ripped through
It drives me insane when a woman wears lace
The current gene structure is 46 pair based
Her heart rumbling and thundering like Captain Nicole Malachowski from an
Airbase on a clear day
Ok Im a pervert Its time to fess up
I might be looking for a leg up but I wont touch
Closet sadomasochist sexual pacifist
I like to role play but I only play masculine
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
Im a giant in the industry just over 5 ft
Even my photo ID dont look like me
The NASA contractor with a satchel of answers
I passed up the Nobel Peace Prize for my passion
Democracy Rules Everything Around Me DREAM
Another fucking acronym just what I need
Killing me with phrases that were designed to put me into dazes
As worthless as my junk mail is
That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die
The Squid Faced God is difficult to describe
Those of weak heart and mind shouldnt even try
In a town near Kadam and Kakrak Jahlalabad
I pray in a hut constructed from Sago Palm
Astoria Oregon Fisherman Poets got lost
Looking for Paradise it only exists in the heart
Cause emotion manifests Thought Thought manifests Words Actions and Reality
But what is attracting me
The overseer of poetic antiquity
The Victoria and Albert Museum kept them for me
Pythagoras Dionysus Loki and Pan
They have enlightened me thru song to understand
The multiplex meshing multiple messages is too much for me
Truly there is too much to see
Ill mix one for you then one for me
Ill mix some for the street mix til my thumbs bleed
A stationary pulley drawing from a wishing well
The Genie gave me more than three because I listen well
Conflicted and confused but completely compelled
To celebrate my birthday alone in the year 2012
I hope I am not alone that would be terrible
If I am celebrating then that would be a miracle
In a newly ordered world living in shit
No matter how good or poor your English is
You lazy and you wanna be the best You crazy
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
Ermaine Will I am the name that my precious mother gave me
The world came to know me as Sir William
The man of steel with a Smallville build with the illest
Some of my thoughts align with Einstein himself
I wanna know Gods thoughts too the rest are details
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course but
The secret to creativity is hiding your sources
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
Do not blame them and hold their humanity hostage
Pray for the families that want them home
Pray for the families abroad that have lost their homes
Who have lost their faith who have lost their hope
Who have lost their point who have lost their own
Yo calm the fuck down I shouldnt have to curse at you
Hydrate as much as possible drink a lot of juice
Fucking bummer no armour inside the Hummer
Gotta hug a motherfucking sandbag for cover
Now Im self employed still gotta pay taxes
Cashless bankrupt aint got no assets
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
Cause I dont want it thats why Im rarely seen in public
President Poetry the popular obedient Pundit
Thats right you can take this job and shove it
I dictate a scribe that causes the court stenographer to die
Brewing hot tea with honey and lime
How is my driving Run you off the road smiling
1800RoadRage Start dialing
The snake will grow feet and stampede you to your defeat
You are weak you lied to us all in your speech
Symbiotic indeed the host bleeds
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Rock climbed the slope shaped like a stop sign
In record clock time Hot Lava lock rhymes rock slide topside
How does one ever really perfect such a craft
Youre obliged by your curiosity to ask
Cubism and Futurism writing amusing lyrics
My opinion of your opinion is you cant be serious
Test driving my principle findings
By designing a new style of rhyming you can take home and try out
A 100 Bars per hour sometimes I doubled the writing secret signature timing
Was the hardest part to figure out
Agonizing the pain of the migraine biting my brain
And everything inside it I cant explain but Im trying
I heard this before I cant remember who said it
We hear from 1000 to 20 thousand cycles per second
Straight out the freak show no preshow
Limited oxygen when I rhyme fast you breath slow
VFR stands for Visual Flight Rules by the Book
You should know this even though it concern the showbiz
Because when in Rome walk as a Roman
Obviously you can see youve made the wrong choice
Fraternize but dont do it in the wrong tone of voice
A bad boy with bad toys made from new alloys
Readapted from a crashed asteroid
My shelter is not far you can borrow what you need
The bunker doors sequestered beneath the tall tumble weeds
After the Matrix Agent Smith continued his movement
The same bullshit that humans are major pollutants
Assemble the Gatlin gun spin it see if it spun
Weapons check correct Im done next one
My rap room is an 8 by 14 underground base
Hyper cube microphone booth in a vacuum of space
Extraterrestrial Isotopic ratios
A broke Scientist in his Lab with no place to go
All these conscious rappers aint saying nothing
Matter fact they have no constituent function
Mix this record different youll hear me call names out
Its played out but there must be alternative routes
The Geneva Protocol Advocates are so sloppy
A human being is not anybodys property
Reading body language in a Zero Gravity environment
Is much easier said than done if your trying it
Attending the Opera with a Pompous Ego Monster
I can barely take my eyes off her big old knockers
Integrated in an existing clothing ensemble
My Saratoga Suit is Military Garment
The Quarantine Isolation Unit is where I house it
My team and I salvage the work of Dr Fritz Albert
If the prototype works theres no telling what I will do
Ill have to get a new Plane a new Pilot and a Crew
Creatively I have never been to this level
First Ill put you in a sideways 8 then a pretzel
Password please have patience verification
I repeat Whats Your Character String Verification
Infrared spectral observation from the Space Station
Before you take a break Ill need you to list and name them
Dock the Kliper Craft at the preliminary designation
Tracing the Detection of Submicron Radiation
Do not leave the Orbital Boom Sensor System running
I heard something called nothing that the Cosmonauts were coming
The rhymes are in place General George Case
And Peter Pace said we had absolutely no time to waste
Next time we meet this whole song will be a new mix
For all the Rippers out there who need a new fix
My father is Jamaican my mother is British
Raised to be civic in the household we spoke Yiddish
ELF 100 cps Elephant Hearing
Im heading for the clearing Storm Clouds appearing
On the back of an Elephant with advanced intelligence
Like Nikola Tesla shit damn thats a smart Elephant
Cease fire breach riot and loot for 3 weeks dont you see
Broke niggas never promote peace
Suzanne Malveaux will interview the polygamist Mr Bis
Undisclosed in his home by the cliffs
I rip shit consistent spit persistent
The sickness spit with conviction promote lyrical fitness
Im lost what version is this
Mozart with a flowchart putting together parts of an unknown art
But coming from my own heart
Burning a disk initializing rhyming and visualizing
Reaching 1000 Bars and climbing
Martial Law Research an all expense paid trip to the dirt
Several miles deep underneath the Earth
The Boston Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
Extraordinary men who meet to review and recommend
I attend the Gubernatorial that never ends 190
We just got a SASO we call this one the Black Hole
Im glad Im the last to go
Zionism the answer to your uncensored question
Guy de Rothschild and his bloodline brethren
Playing the guitar singing folk songs speaking my mind
Nobody could really understand the reason I rhyme
Infrared direct hit target bled proceed to inject the syringe with meds
That subsequently pinch your leg
You feel like your an inch from being dead
But you alive instead youre really dead your just living in my head
Fire for effect smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation roll out like this
I will spare no sin walk in with a scarecrow grin looking crazy
Cause thats what you made me
Classified payloads with no frequency safe modes no safety
And I still made time for the ladies
Ceiling visibility unlimited
A lyricist river fish surrounded by nigga shrimp
Im a killer pimp
Somebody Hip Hop dont need me
Nigga I grew up in DC I love Lil Weezy 210
Me and Baby got the same name
We probably got the same blood in our veins liquid propane
At the top of the Temple Mount Mosque I look at the Sun
I just have a few words for everyone
Everybody bow your heads and say this prayer
From this moment Hip Hop is united everywhere
Poet Laureate Infinity
I will forever be the illest lyrically
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
Poet Laureate Infinity
This has never been done before in history
",you it shouldnt sound like Im quitting cause Im not If I am to continue its up to Hip Hop Weary of body and mind tired of swimming against the tide Why swim or walk when I can glide Zero Gravity exercising requires expert timing for sky diving My call sign is Flying Wing An impossible profession St Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 Bar message Now you may go You have

little yo Gotta find a way to generate doe Promoter wont pay me what I want for a show Why do it for free when Im worth my weight in gold Mind Body Soul inseparable incredibly Proto plasma recycles the matter perpetually Hip Hop became boring lyrics seem more like a vestigial organ But they should be more important The diaphragm the thymus Activate the latent powers that reside inside us with 13 chakras You get the Guantanamo Bay the Alcatraz way You heard what I say These pigs gotta pay I steady my approach this supposed to be a no fly zone Black sheep squadron with strobe light hoes The hurricanes eyes open Gale winds blowing Moses on a row boat floating in the ocean I figured out how to save water in a drought If we save the right amount I know we can make it out The ever expanding

Prana In a yoga pose tryna get close to yo mama Your ear cartilage has been targeted The bombing will commence Dont be a bitch nigga you started it On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet Drawing mathematics suspended in space as holographics Scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal Viable style its like trying to ride a bull The lyrical inimical is miserable because Ive built a citadel Of syllables that made me invincible Am I a mad man or a mason A patriot or a pagan West Coasting in a 64 with Rose Gold Daytons The propulsion system matrix is poorly calibrated Im waiting on the parts special order replacements Battle Rap is just aimless entertainment Second Round Knockout was one of they favourites Fuck all the haters My luck was crushed I felt like they fronted My heart

my New Shit Time keep on slipping the Ripper keeps ripping But right now my image stands still in a prism My light reflects like a mirror I choose to share it The Precession of Earth is nearing Im preparing Assessment and Planning things should I put mustard on these sandwiches a Fathers job is so challenging My pupil size increase constriction and velocity decrease You cant Emcee take a seat What are you building Bis Is it a flying Silver Disk If you ever leave youll be missed I tear thru the Galactic drift I travel 10 digits in 10 minutes Now thats some shit You think thats fast Nah Thats faster than you think By the time you blink the whole Universe shrinks A word to the wise try to keep your eyes in the skies And try to keep your ears on my rhymes A magic reminder that the fire will not expire Pyrus Sidonious gives me energy when Im tired The Sun is so bright my eyes hurt Im forced to look downward Now I see inside the Earth I Thank Mother Gaia for bearing us green grass But it wont last were killing her with greenhouse gas You said the best shouldnt have to ask for respect Is that correct Yes could you please speak up I SAID YES I hold Hip Hop responsible Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in their articles Gone til November Ill be gone forever I made these bars so you could ALL remember The illest MC to put it all on the line My career was crucified but Im

rap flytrap Theres no way Earth you can get around that This is a no brainer stop the complaining If Hip Hop is dead Im here to save it Pages upon pages everything Ive created The bar was below basic

That their little angels are special indeed
And you could grow up to be anything
But who would imagine a king
A shepherd or teacher is what you could be
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king
It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing your name
That the world would be different cause you were alive
Thats why heaven stood still to proclaim
One day an angel said quietly
That soon he would bring something special to me
And of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring
Who would imagine
Who could imagine
Who would imagine a king
Mmm hmm

Counting all the days
Seeing the same old faces

Now other men mean well
But always bring me down
They have nothing new to say
Theyre still hangin round
And when I need cheering up
When Im feeling kinda low
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
And you can see us glow wherever we may go
Hes my man
All I need is that he shine his smile on me
When Im all alone needing company
And hes the only man who can make me feel
That his love is honest
That his love is real
And when my spirits sinking down
Need a lift off the ground
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
And you can see us glow wherever we may go

Greetings and salutations Im runnin outta patience
So everything in moderation even moderation
Check every single allegation for recalibration
Call that the big pay back its debt consolidation
The credit fell what the hell too much bchamel
Well FML they desecrated the decibel
Go check the mail then let me know if its heads or tails
My ears burn like desert trails and Jezebels
Uh somebody must be talkin bout me
For carryin a big stick and walkin loudly
Articles in the Times and the New Yorker bout me
My killer instinct is like Orchid probably
Im a Pulitzer Prize Fighter how I vaporize writers
Shut em down at one time synchronize silence
Make the audience forget you call it Alzheimers
Child rhymers dont come at the old timers
Whether your fan base is lil mommas or Obamas
How you claim to have somethin in check with no commas
You and Mary got the same request its No Drama
Im the pinnacle of language yes the Dalai Lama
Who the clown talkin down to the twentyone pound
I gotta send him some rounds to simmer him down
Cause youre not worthy to even touch the hem of the gown
The brim of the crown motherfucker remember the sound
Its like
Hey yo
Yo
Since the second grade I been gainfully employed
Hustlin for change everyday from three to four
When other kids was into playin games and bein bored
Goin against the grains what I painfully enjoyed
When they was into race cars trains TV and toys
I was thinkin fat gold chains and freakazoids
Fillin the deeper void listenin to that Indecent Noise
People used to tell me Boy your brain gon be destroyed
Left hand to the law right hand to Allah
Both hands to applaud who brought sand to the shore
Confessin all your sins to the dope man through a door
I seen a preacher man sniffin cocaine through a straw
We almost had it all just one more cannon ball
And two more Geritol with one more Adderall
I got the game sewn like the tailor of Panama
Now I go by the name of an untamed animal
Wonderin how I can evolve to prestigious and less vicious
A more visceral individual best wishes
Just on principle I been answerin death wishes
What the Lord giveth is a king long liveth

5668,"A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
Tonights the night I get in some shit
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock Gs
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
Pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is badmouth cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes the game should be sold
Im sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even Mama couldnt raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldnt reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
Im duckin the cops I hit the weed as Im clutchin my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block what if I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it if I die tonight
Tonights the night I get in some shit
Polish your pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to poppin niggas is droppin then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method whenever steppin keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posses using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name a different game aint a thing changed
Im seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here if I die tonight
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga is ya ha
If I die tonight
Never fear never worry
If I die tonight
Tonights the night I get in some shit
Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Pray to the Heavens 357s to the sky
And I hope Im forgiven for thug livin when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin these simps for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game praying for punishment and pain
Going insane never die I live eternal who shall I fear
Dont shed a tear for me nigga I aint happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading Murdered to death my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers dont understand if I die tonight
Nigga if I die tonight
No fear nigga never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight
You know

Illa tight havin niggas open like the thrill of dykes
Jean Grae Yakuza mass murderer
Friends who got the dirt on her
Foes who never heard of her
Wild Style my mouth bomb the train up
I spit Krylon in five colors when I speak I spray my name up
Split your wig up like Denny Bruce
Splash your remains and brains out
On the street like Henny and juice
Noose your neck and loosen your spine from back
Shift your spleen rip til its just obscene
From downtown swingin it New York illest who rip it
Ever flow like a river fuck your girl like a nigga what

I spit bars yall spit repetitive raps
Im a street dude who decided to rhyme with lines thatll crack the disc between your mind and your spine
Thats why yall wanna bite my design
And thats why usually I hold the mic like a 9
Pistolwhip you on the side of your eye watch it pop out
We knock out cats and wipe the floors with their rocks out

6498,"Yo remember high school
With that dude who thought he was so cool
Walking around like everybody should know who he is
Like he was some superstar in the biz
Just because he had a Japanese car and some rims
Its silly aint it
It goes to show how tainted
Cause these hoes jocked him like he was somebody who supposedly made it
And Im not hating man the dude was my boy
But I watched girl after girl get their world destroyed
Now when a squirrels a squirrel and a nut is a nut
And I seen a lot of girls cut so they could get stuffed
Or at least be cool in the high school soap opera
Cause kids do anything to be popular
Guys get their hair cut so girls can jock ya
But if girls get with guys their known as a trick
But if a dude does the same shit hes known as a pimp
And the question is Is there really a difference
Remember that girl in high school that everyone wanted to hit
She wore them dresses with the bestest breasteses the size of Texas
And she was the queen of estrogen White Black Puerto Rican and Mexican
And she sat next to you in third period
She powdered her face but her skin had no flaws
Her tits looked like she wore three wonderbras
Thank God for that math book you put on your lap to
Cover up your jeans when your dick got hard
I mean she was amazing Im not playing
You were like 14 but she was still the kind of girl you wanted a baby with
And I could tell the way that she would rock them pants
That a lot of dudes hit it but she wanted a chance
You talked to her but she gave you the shoulder
She was the type of girl that was cold as Boulder
Shed only mess with ya if you drove a Rover
What I push Well fuck it
Lets just say a bucket OK
Anyway one day I rocked a show
And I see her right there chilling up in the front row
Next time I go to my math class for sho shes talking about
Hey yo bro I didnt know that you flowed
Hey yo whats up with that CD Maybe we could eat lunch after PE
Ah hee hee hee hee hee
If its the mic you rock the car you got the 3pointer you shot that gets the girl then shes probably a breezy


Remember high school with that girl you cant remember Who 
The one that never stuck out she kind of looked like whatever
Kinda nerdy never came to the parties
She went home after school and never really chilled with nobody
She was in one of your classes and used to wear glasses
With braces that accented her pimples that werent really attractive
But she was good in Spanish and let you cheat off her answers
But when youd see her in the hall you would walk right past her
You acted like a bastard and never treated her right
Cause her body wasnt buckling and her face wasnt tight
Well guess what
See that beautiful girl with the big butt
Standing at the incense shop reading the poetry that she writes
Thats her Oh hell nah I know thats not her
Wait minus the pimples the braces and a lot less nerd
Take off the overalls and the baggy sweatshirt
Yeah there she is reading about her words
Shit man Imma go spit some game
Wait I see some resemblance from like way back in the day
I rememeber that girl that only liked me cause I rhymed
And now Im really only talking to this girl cause she looks fine
Back when she was normal I wouldnt give her my time
Shit thats crazy
I kinda feel sleezy
If I could flip the scenario
Im the same as these hoes
Kinda like the male version of a breezy",Lets just say a bucket OK Anyway one day I rocked a show And I see her right there chilling up in the front row Next time I go to my math class for sho shes talking about Hey yo bro I didnt know that you flowed Hey yo whats up with that CD Maybe we could eat lunch after PE Ah hee hee hee hee hee If its the mic you rock the car you got the 3pointer you shot that gets the girl then shes probably a breezy Remember high school with that girl you cant remember Who The one that never stuck out she kind of looked like whatever Kinda nerdy never came to the parties She went home after school and never really chilled with nobody She was in one of your classes and used to wear glasses With braces that accented her pimples that werent really attractive But she was good in Spanish and let you cheat off her answers But when youd see her in the hall you would walk right past her You acted like a bastard and never treated her right Cause her body wasnt buckling and her face wasnt tight Well guess what See that beautiful girl with the big butt Standing at the incense shop reading the poetry that she writes Thats her Oh hell nah I know thats not her Wait minus the pimples the braces and a lot less nerd Take off the overalls and the baggy sweatshirt Yeah there she is reading about her words Shit man Imma go spit some game Wait I see some resemblance from like way back in the day I rememeber that girl that only liked me cause I rhymed And now Im really only talking to this girl cause she looks fine Back when she was normal I wouldnt give her my time Shit thats crazy I kinda feel sleezy If I could flip the scenario Im the same as these hoes Kinda like the male version of a breezy,Yo remember high school With that dude who thought he was so cool Walking around like everybody should know who he is Like he was some superstar in the biz Just because he had a Japanese car and some rims Its silly aint it It goes to show how tainted Cause these hoes jocked him like he was somebody who supposedly made it And Im not hating man the dude was my boy But I watched girl after girl get their world destroyed Now when a squirrels a squirrel and a nut is a nut And I seen a lot of girls cut so they could get stuffed Or at least be cool in the high school soap opera Cause kids do anything to be popular Guys get their hair cut so girls can jock ya But if girls get with guys their known as a trick But if a dude does the same shit hes known as a pimp And the question is Is there really a difference Remember that girl in high school that everyone wanted to hit She wore them dresses with the bestest breasteses the size of Texas And she was the queen of estrogen White Black Puerto Rican and Mexican And she sat next to you in third period She powdered her face but her skin had no flaws Her tits looked like she wore three wonderbras Thank God for that math book you put on your lap to Cover up your jeans when your dick got hard I mean she was amazing Im not playing You were like 14 but she was still the kind of girl you wanted a baby with And I could tell the way that she would rock them pants That a lot of dudes hit it but she wanted a chance You talked to her but she gave you the shoulder She was the type of girl that was cold as Boulder Shed only mess with ya if you drove a Rover What I push Well fuck it

Its hard to predict what would happen next 
Oh shit he has a gun Drop the gun
You couldve prevented a tragedy
You can approach but the danger light is blinkin
A selfdesctruct button is activated when Im thinkin
This is a tribulation the weak is judged
The prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge
I took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme
Theyre seein doubles of me but it wasnt a dream
One vision was of life the other was death
And life didnt give a fuck if death took your last breath
So you burn in my pit that I call hell
Where you got sent because your shit dont sell
My twentytwenty was blurry from the smoke
Of the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didnt choke
I started doing them I kept on doing them two of them
Shoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
But fuck it they can approach to the danger
If you can be seen you can be hit
If you can be hit you can be killed
Hes over there Shoot him 
Fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangler
Out run the shot of a gun when the games up
Murder in the first degree but its worse to be
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
With everybody thinkin of death
I kept workin to be one of the last niggas left
So many people lookin for hope they broke
Without checkin the fingerprints on a motherfuckers throat
A heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me
So figure to see the DEAD
Bodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary
So its very necessary to carry
Ammunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution
Before Dre goes off
And starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the
Anger for the real nigga when I approach to danger
Approach the motherfuckin danger
Come back to hell and see me some time 
This is it yall 
Final approach to danger death destruction around every corner
Another dead body and you wanna keep runnin
But even the rain turns black
All you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight
No prison nobody makes bail
Everybody gotta go but see it aint no jail
Think about death takin your last breath
Heart beatin like a motherfucker like it aint no time left
With so many ways to stay up I gotta get mine
Even though they wanna make a crime yo
Of bein real a federal letter in the beginnin
Because of the release of Fuck the Police
Fuck it I approach the danger
Cause I dont give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
Cause in the long run we all die

3750,"Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light I lost my eyesight
I aint been that drunk in awhile
Along about one I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Ive got 2020 vision when I aint drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I aint never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Well I made up my mind I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape that Im in
I done spotted me another queen
Sittin at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes I thought Id been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a ten

Hatin on a baller but they cant stop my pay
Stop all this hatin I cant take it no more
Im just tryna get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for
Pop the locks on the Benz steal his keys
Too high to see his own enemies
Seen his baby mama tears with a short skirt
His last ride was in a car I mean a black hearse
His friend took his life for the mighty dollar
Then ran through the alley mustve been a coward
No more hit em up like in the old days
Homies ride with Mack 10s and AKs
Thats why I roll by myself I mean alone
Cause haters be all up on
Tryna sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
And the same niggas wanna blow on your weed
Set you up for a caper
Dont wanna see you make no money then take ya
And try to figure out how to get what you got
Cause haters be the same niggas on your spot

How do hatin get started Its started by the jealous people
And they get mad over the things you have and the things theyll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really aint hard to get
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors Im really not impressed
I tell you only one time with my scrilla fool dont mess
Im only in with a few cause these bitchmade niggas is actors
See I done had to many gunins runins with these ass backwards
Nonpackers Im strapped like P or C
Just in case these niggas after me capture me
Forget Im goin out with a blast
And I put that on some cash Im standin last
For some ass yall young crazed punks are trippin
Dont hate me nigga and go head and credit my dippin
Im admittin that Im not only on the twat
But I know I got stopped on the 
Its understood that Im not one of the best young playas that ever lived

Stop all the hatin I cant take it no more

But really I cant save em
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know yous a motherfuckin playa
And Imma try to make yall kill me in a matter of lines
I got friends that can turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me
When I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes upon my enemies I gotta watch my friends
Like when Im sittin on top or ridin a Benz
Why dont yall go out yalls ass up and get somethin
Dont worry about how I got mines
Always tryin to point a finger and say thats not mine
And kill me
It kills me
Its disgusting cause I got a few Gs
They try to rob me
But the white manll make it they wont touch em
Smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
But I just cant call it or catch
But I still got Gs and Im still ballin

1811,"Once upon a time before I took up smiling
I hated the moonlight
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling
Seemed flat as the moonlight
With no one to stay up for I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heard somebody whisper Please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heard somebody whisper Please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Now I have a girl of my own

You have to sleep the dream
You have to dream the dream
You gotta touch
You have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when its not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream
Yeah any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with Oodles of noodles now we eating lobster
As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
Im the realest nigga in it I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck em
New jewelry new whips on the way now
Brr brr thats yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall never stay down
Stand up nigga I can never lay down
Wins and the losses it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou lawyer said we lookin awesome
Swap that Patek for them cuffs take them off us
Lil bitch call me Lil Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out its still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns man this shit getting borin
Half a milli last week you wouldve thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out I guess they thought I was normal
They aint know I was different Im like Lord be my witness
Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon do division break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen they aint see the vision
When I had a foreign them bitches know I aint see them bitches
So Ima ball on em
Magic City let it fall on em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah
My nigga bail half a milli he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how Im rocking I go on them streets
Glock 40 keep it on me we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything just let me know if its beef
We bring the war I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe oh
Pushing the foreigns drive through the trenches Trenches 
Top of the food chain head of commission Mission 
We wackin niggas without permission Mission 
Never was personal it was business Brrrrr 
Settle down let it settle down
Couldnt tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon tell me now
Im running round
Glock with a drum that hold a hundred rounds Brrr 
If it was Fuck them niggas then
Its fuck them niggas now fuck em
Never change on my roll dawgs
Bout that Cain bang them thangs like we ODog
Walk up in a dealer and I pull that rolls off
These niggas said I wouldnt make it like I told yall

Thieves nigga direct the trees to the SmokeFest
Wanna take a toke Yes 
The newest zone Im in
Im like Smithsonian nigga fuck it call me Napoleon
Wave the torch cut the head off the Leviathan
The terminology Im rhymin in cause a frenzy up in Ireland
Hit ya Im gon get ya
And drop the bomb scripture at your barmitzvah
Yo map shit out blast through the speakers
With a wifebeater on Bushe velour a new pair of sneakers
Street niggas hang on the sidewalk
Thats where I learned my fly talk pimp strut and how to skywalk
Moderatin how we establish the whole Conglomerate
The way we honor it youll never conquer it
See how we wreck has a global effect on even Polish people
Young and restless down to the old and feeble
Peep them Czechoslovakian to Yugoslavian niggas
Be all into my bounce so dont be botherin niggas
So NOW you should feel the whole cathedralish bounce
Put one in your stomach leave you in a fetalish crouch nigga
My vernacular is spectacular
Strategic plansll have you lookin wacker than a postal office massacre
Is that so Make moves just like a fatso
Bounce in a minivan Astro after my gat Blow 
Ayo get up get out get dough

My whole entire mind state deeper
Than astronomy and mathematics like Galileo
Smash you niggas like mashed potato
Back when niggas used to rock Ballys and Clarks
I used to watch little niggas shouldnt hustle nickel crack in the park
Barrels spray the brighter flame in the dark
Bloodspill stain on the street thats how niggas be leavin they mark
Fuckin with diplomats who love Baileys
Monopolize and quickly get other money fuckin with Israelis
So solid how we be symbolic
To a handful of niggas that be all schemin on the same wallet
Them type niggas that be conspirin and kidnappin
Shit happens Gun clap for you in the gift wrappin
You should follow how the style switch up
Like a group of religious niggas schemin to kill they archbishop
You big pussy nigga actin all hard
Call me atheist because I dont believe in you God
Its like a grand feast celebratin the bounce of the century
I tote the recipe quick for any type of discrepancy
Busta Rhymes the great renaissance artist and architect
Like how a Filippo Brunelleschi portrait is so hard to get
We got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless we split your head and your chest now rock to the beat
Yo we got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless we split your head and your chest now rock to the beat

4964,"I admit that in the past Ive been a nasty
They werent kidding when they calledâmeâwell a witch
Butâyoull find that nowadays Ive mendedâall my ways
Repented seen the light and made a switch
True Yes
And I fortunately know a little magic
Its a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately please dont laugh
I use it on behalf of the miserable lonely and depressed
Pathetic
Poor unfortunate souls in pain in need
This one longing to be thinner
This one wants to get the girl
And do I help them Yes indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying Spells Ursula please
And I help them
Yes I do
Now its happened once or twice
Someone couldnt pay the price
And Im afraid I had to rake them cross the coals
Yes Ive had the odd complaint
But on the whole Ive been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls
Now heres the deal If you dare
Theres a potion Ill prepare
Just consume and youll be human
Three whole days up above

By the end of day 3
Listen up this is key
Just convince Mr Prince
And get a kiss of true love
If I do
Lucky you
You stay human through and through
You can go wed your beau
And be totally divine
And if not
Then guess what girl
Youll turn back into a MerGirl
Same as you once were girl
But that tail will be mine
Dont be shy dear
What will it be
You want the guy dear
Leave it to me
But what about my father
And my family
Hmm
Sorry dear
Theres no way to spin it
Lifes full of tough choices innit
One last thing silly me
Did I mention theres a fee
Nothing choice just your voice
No more talking singing zip
Not a word
Not a note
Not a whisper from your throat
But
Show some spine youll be fine
Honey heres a little tip
Youll have your looks
Your pretty face
And dont underestimate the importance of body language ha
The men up there dont like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes on land its much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all dear what is idle babble for
Come on you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead make your choice
Im a very busy woman
And I havent got all day
It wont cost much
Just your voice
You poor unfortunate soul
Its sad but true
If you want to cross a bridge my sweet
Youve got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam Jetsam now Ive got her boys
The boss is on a roll

Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see no looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Life began to fade into the black
Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore
Desperate meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything was said and done
I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
Still I tried to find my way
Spinning hours into days
Burning like a flame behind my eyes
Drown it out drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner a slave to the disguise
Disappeared the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time to say goodbye
And I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
No reason left me to survive

Do you understand the metaphoric phrase Lyte as a Rock
Its explaining how heavy the young lady is
You know what Im saying King
Yes my brother but I would consider Lyte as a Rock
A simile because of the usage of the word as
And now directly from the planet of Brooklyn
MC Lyteas a Rock
Must I say it again I said it before
Move out the way when Im coming through the door
Me heavy As Lyte as a Rock
Guys watch even some of the girls clock
Step back it aint that type of party
No reply if you aint somebody
Get out my face dont wanna hear no more
If you hate rejection dont try to score
First base You aint got what it takes
You smile you wink you big fake flake
Youre so pathetic you make my stomach turn
You beg you borrow now you have to learn
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
repeat 2X 
Lyte as a Rock or I should say a boulder
Rolling down your neck pounding on your shoulders
Never shall I be an emcee called a wannabe
I am the Lyte LYTE
This is the way it is dont ever forget
Hear the rhyme by someone else and you know they bit
All in the way just little obstacles
Chew em up spit em out just like popsicles
Suckers out of my way were not on the same wavelength
I show stability potential and strength
On the other hand you are weak and unruly
Could never be a spy cause youre just a plain stoolie
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
repeat 2X 
Im a slave Im a slave Im a slave to the rhythm
Def rhymes on the microphone is what Im givin
Yes I am a Rock and you are just a pebble
Milk turn up the bass and Rock adjust the levels
If a rap can paint a thousand words then I can paint a million
Wait Lyte is capable of painting a bazillion raps
So when I say it this is what I mean
Audio Two an alliance on the scene
And Id like to say whassup to my producer King of Chill
Party people are you ready jam if you will
Never underestimate Lyte the Emcee I am a rapper who is here
To make the things the way theyre meant to be
The World Ultimate Im here to take the title
But I had a little trouble upon my arrival
But I got rid of those who tried to rock me
Lyte is here no one can stop me
I am the Lyte aaaaaaasasarock LY LLYTE
repeat 2X 
There are HipHop leaders this you know
We also have hiphoppers that follow
By the tone of my voice you can tell I am a scholar
Im also the leader of the hiphop followers
Now get this Im at a jam and Im rockin it
Suckers like a checkerboard when black is clockin it
The grace as I ease across the stage
Bars around the audience sort of like a cage
They laugh cause they assume Im in prison
But in reality theyre locked in
Once again Ill state that I cant be stopped
Cause yo I am as Lyte as Rock

Oh had to take your hand and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didnt care before you were here
I danced in laughter with the ever after
But all things change let this remain
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer will they come for me next time
For every choice mistake I made its not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay Ill wait Ill understand

2172,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt Im not a queer
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
And each and every highway
And that much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
Ive planned each charted course
Each careful step along the highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
There were times
Im sure you knew
When there was fuck fuck
Fuck all else to do
But through it all
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced em all and the world
And did it my way
Ive loved and been a snide
Ive had my fill uh
My share of losing
And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I killed a cat
And might I say
Not in the die way
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way
For what is a brat
What has he got
When he wears hats
And he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I fucked no bloke
And did it my way

Afrika Bambaataa
Kool Herc was looping the break beat
Rocksteady was breakin
Thats whats up
Gave Scott La Rock dap
Proceeded up to the bar one Taki 183 and flat black was tight on the wall
Eddie Pint was with Dante
And went to bomb broadway
Sugarhill RunDMC were kickin raps
Busta and the Beasties came in drinking brass monkeys
Bumrushed the show hopped on stage then
A whole bunch of white dudes opened the door and came in
After Ed Lover Dr Dre then Big Daddy Kane
Said there aint no half steppin walk this way
Went to the next room had the 90s on it hell yeah
Ayo it smell like chronic
Hella juice gin
I grab my cup try to fill it to the brim
Somebody said Ayo you aint chipped in Im playing nephew go ahead
Ice Cube was choppin it up
With MC Ren and Quik was playing the cuts
I saw Eazy Spice 1 and King Tee
Bloods and Crips talkin shit and straight schemin
Olde English Starter caps and gold daytons
Goldplated hearing Bones Jheri curl activator
And the party started crackin
And this dude in the background who looked familiar started dancing
But I dont know he seemed dope
The whole party was like he hadnt rapped in the east coast
Lyrical physical very artistical
Give the party people something funky to listen to
Step up if you wanna get hurt
Step Step up if you wanna get hurt
All you MCs are some riders
All you need is a line
Til you change and rearrange
And then what happened this time
I checkmate terminate never late contemplate
Mind state is never fake hesitate you lose
There was this group in the cypher called Das FX
And a Tribe Called Quest
QTip was searchin for his wallet sayin somebody got him
10 dollars sayin it was someone from Compton
LL was on the side of the kangol talkin about his Momma
Sayin that if anyone stepped
Theyd get knocked out He promised
Watching ButterPecan Ricans licking their ice cream
Ghostface did lines and Bees that were lime green
liquorice and a dutch
I hit that shit once and then passed out off the blunt
I woke up in struggle for breath by Nas
He said sleep was the cousin of death my God
Door busted down and I thought it was the cops
It was 2Pac saying that he had just gotten shot
Stood up out the wheel chair said fuck this city
Grabbed a Cristal bottle pointed it at Biggie
Puff jumped up was like take that one
The whole party stopped and said
2Pac left the party with Suge in the lac
Nobody ever thought that Pac would never come back
An hour later Big and Puff left
Big said he was ready to die but thered be life after his death
Craziest shit Ive ever been to the wildest venue
But it wasnt over yet the party must continue
Yeah Yeah I said continue
Yeah Yeah Yeah


Pink gators my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know I flow some old funky shit
Crucial lyrical style aint what it used to
Microphone check one two echo 
For some this is where the party began
Some say its where the party was crashed
There was a new room a new dude named Shady in the Aftermath
Hi my name is what it was that everybody started to want to rap
Rock fans from the other parties put down their guitar straps
And started writing their bars on a pad
The burbs were already in the building
And the media been feeling if another party was on smash
Pepsi endorsements Spike Cocacola
Was tellin the whole world where the party was at
The line to get in it wasnt just around the building
It was around New Zealand and the underground was making chat
Saying it was wack remember the art the heart they taking it back
But it was too late for that they started making scratch the line
Complaining about the game was saying its wack
Hold up half the people that were dissing it
Were half the reason that the party was so big
And everyone in line was out there trying to get respect
And then the party got put on the internet
Shit
They bumrushed the door
You couldnt move anymore
There wasnt room on the floor
And out came the neighbors
Getting on TV and complaining about the noise
Bill OReilly and Oprah came down and they started hating
The venue wasnt making money cause no one was paying
Unless you had Lil Wayne or TPain in the room
Nas came down and said the party was dead
Somebody lit a match all you heard was a

7687,"I Used to Love HER Lyrics
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Yes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
And to the beat Com Sensell be the sure shot come on
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh yo when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
ACom Sense yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
UAC yo we gotta be the sure shot
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me by not preachin to me
But speakin to me in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in LA
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the problack was goin out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into RB hiphouse bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
If you dont check it mmmm bust it bust it
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once The Man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the innercity circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin rock and dressin hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin about poppin Glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now shes a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it but Im committed
Girl hes committed But so many niggas hit it
That shes just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin her and takin her to the sewer
But Imma take her back hopin that the shit stop
Cause who Im talkin about yall is hiphop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Mainframe yo they gotta be the sure shot
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two Com Sense is gonna drop haha

To one another
How can we become
Like sister and brother
Darling I beg of you
If our love must end
Ask me to forget you

That you took pride in
I just couldnt be
The friend youd confide in
If its goodbye for us
Well never meet again
Ask me to forget you
But dont ask me to be friends
Wanting you so badly
Needing you like this
How can I just look at
The lips that I used to kiss
If theres someone else
Dont let me see him
Cause Ill spend my life
Wishing I could be him

5059,"Ay this is life man niggas out here talkin
Rappin about shit you aint never seen or had no parts in youknowhatImsayin
Shit aint cool man ay Lo take em where you from
Let me take you to a place where the sun dont shine
Killers dont talk little kids dont mind
Men dont work dont take care of babies
You bought my album but bootleggers dont pay me
City runnin wild cats dont give a fuck
Junior High students dont say no to drugs
Liquor stores dont ask shorties for their ID
This is a place where dont nothin surprise me
The ghetto
The ghetto yo
Now you can get shot everyday its a struggle to be alive
Mentally physically only the strong survive
Cant hide from the fact ghettos is filled with blacks blacks 
Crack crack smack smack roaches and rats
Thugs totin they gats this aint a nice place to visit
The people that you live with hearts cold and frigid
That girl over there dont even bother with her why 
Shes a hoodrat golddigger never had a father figure
Her older brother was a big time drug dealer
When he was young his role model was a drug dealer
Now that hes older everybody wants to cop a boulder
He took a bullet in his head now hes in a coma bloaw 
You callin 911 this aint a joke
You rollin like a blunt cause you might get smoked
The sad part about it aint the money or the dope
The trigger man wasnt even old enough to vote
Shit aint all good in the hood
Touch mine wish a nigga would
You knowhatImsayin In the ghetto 
Landlords dont do nothin but collect rent
Police dont patrol serve or protect it
Brothers dont allow others to hustle on they block
Always carry heat cause the beef dont stop
And it dont quit everyday the same shit
Hustlin to get you what your job cant get
And I aint even talkin bout a Benz or Mercedes what you talkin about 
Im talkin about toothpaste diapers for your babies
The basic necessities of life
The homeless sleepin in a cardboard box every night
The only playgrounds is vacant lots and burned buildings
You gotta feel sorry for the children
How they gon do they homework when they homes dont work
They cant read books cause the lights dont work nope 
They cant take a bath cause the water dont work nope 
The stove in the kitchen plus the heat dont work nope 
Its cold at night they mommas cant afford jackets
She too busy tryin to support the crack habit
The State took her kids now they all doin bids man that sound crazy 
I know it sound crazy but thats how it is in the ghetto
The ghetto
All I see are hearts thats hollow from Detroit to Chicago
Just hopin you can follow
Shits real I know it sounds crazy
Shit its how it is how it is
This is a place where Nothin surprise me
This is a place where Nothin surprise me

Say she want to eat sushi I gave her enough to go shoppin
Anything she wantâsheâcashin out withoutâno problems
How you gon love aânigga that aint got love for your mama
You can die today it aint gon save me nothin but drama Super 
Workin on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual Like usual 
Niggas swear they passed us they doin too much
Havent done my taxes Im too turnt up

Help me fight my demons off know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar she didnt wanna leave
Treat her like garbage my heart was on my sleeve
Shouldve chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep
Why should I have trust for you You aint get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you You aint kneelin to my feet
Why should I be carin when I know I cant be beat
See how the ice be glarin when I come through and retrieve
Its easy to know its us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket you niggas beneath me
Who causin a racket in Jamaica on the weekend
Half a ticket on vacation I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy cause my money long like Stevie

Yeah I know its been a minute
Dont you know
Just look over your shoulders honey
Whenever you need me
Just look Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders honey
Yeah you need me Woo 
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles nigga
I lead this new generation boy dont argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors authors and novel spitters
And its all for the literature
And its all for the hideous the nastiest flows the Chlamydia uh
I aint afraid to say I need you ah yeah Hiphop hiphop hiphop 
I promise Id never leave you ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees my prototype for every
My share of deeds and RIPs
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen Look over your shoulder 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
Im posed to shine remind Im king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros the cons the diamond rings
Im full with time but Ima bring
The soul divine and cross between
Whats yours and mines the gold the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals Scream 
For hiphop look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks baby you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over its love
I know ya Woo 
Dont you know baby
Dont you know baby
Just look over your shoulders honey
Whenever you need me
Just look Just over your shoulders
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders honey
Yeah yeah you need me Woo 
Shhh look over your shoulder get me
Cause I done bodied the game to the point niggas scared to rap with me
Kept burnin til they anointed me one of the kings of Black history
And yes I see the game is a little different niggas lack simply
Them bars and I spit em like darts til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it dont matter how much you gon try to convince me
And you gon make my gun cock and talk a whole nother way yo
Woahohohohoh Woo 
I am the Buddha the Ali Baba the believerer maker
So pristine the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake em
So rude Im so ice cold but Im what you need to just wake em
All them crowns and medals on the wall waitin for me to just take em
When I arrive my theme music got a pound to it
And when I leave even my shadow got a sound to it
Cause Im the god of the harder the martyr the father
I spit a saliva thats leaking a lava
Completin the saga while meetin and greetin
And beating you niggas completely conquer
Extremely bark on a nigga you see me
And deeply carve up a nigga believe me
Graffiti your armor you heebie you jeebie
Bikini your broad up You guinea pig 
See me now give me the startup and treat me
You greet me and meet me with arms up
So sweet when I speak have a seat it was deep
I was sleep now the gods up hmm
Upholding the fundamentals while most of you boast a rental
Focus on whats most essential spit bars to provoke your mental
Do I have your entendimiento
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder Woo 
Dont you know baby Ooh woah 
Dont you know baby Mhm oh yeah

5135,"Onefiftyeight Lewis Avenue
Between Lafayette and Van Buren that was back during
The days of hangin on my BedStuy block
With Spence and Mitch followin my cousin Murdoch
All the brothers were real goin for what they feel
By the way peace to my man Sha and Big Neal
Now in ninetythree Im still bein me
You think my fridgerator aint full of Olde E Huh
A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches
And I dont try to act brand new
Eatin escargots and usin words like rendezvous
The ghetto life Ive seen a lot overcome
Make a little money and then forget where they came from
Livin a plastic lifestyle youre more false than dentures
Dont make me pull your file stop shammin
Stop holdup pause wait 2X 
Stop shammin
So why you wanna be what youre not
And claim to have things that you know you aint got
Youre just a fantasizer spendin all your money
On Lusters pink oil moisturizer
Just to make your hair curly and thin
You say Black is beautiful but then you go and bleach your skin
Money youre worse than Yacub
Cause their are eight stages of graft and you broke down to two
Plus you got a bad case of jungle fever
And nmmananahnah I just cant believe ya
Its quite obvious you dont wanna be a black man
So whats next youre gonna join the Klu Klux Klan
You sold out to your race and its a big disgrace
You cant look your own people in the face
You wonder why it aint no black schools or hospitals
Youre makin millions of dollars and its pitiful
That you can donate to leukemia all the time
But you cant give the Nation of Islam a dime
They mention Muslims you change the subject
You cant even shake Farrakhan hand in public
That whole busy attitude is a sham
Umm bro umm brother umm Brougham stop shammin
Stop holdup pause wait 2X 
Change the groove and fuck it up a little bit
I look in the mirror at times I say Damn Black Caesar
Howd you get to be the woman pleaser
Cause I remember when girls didnt notice me
And now they wanna Come and Talk To Me like Jodeci
Its strange how back in the days I couldnt get with em
Now all of a sudden the honies they wanna give me rhythm
Well Ima hit it but still I show no pity
So I hope you dont think you gonna be in my next video
And many brothers I never even ran with
Be actin like they been hangin with me since I was a kid
I mean just to get a piece of the action
Man they start rememberin more times than Michael Jackson
But I cant fade to the tagalongs
That want me to drag em on
Frontin like a friend just so I can put em in
But you cuttin yourself paper thin stop shammin
Stop holdup pause wait 2X 
And Im out

Is the fruit of my labor my plate is full of color
Arugula and rutabaga share the food with my neighbor
Truly innovative like Fela Kuti and Ginger Baker
Moon raker sun scraper will give you fire for the papers
Take you higher on the vapors
Sire of the flavor designer of the caper
Executive executor direct when Im on path
Flight without navigator plight of a savior
Now what would Jesus do
How you believe in Him You dont believe in you
The idea that you doubting Im unbeatable
Vizzini in the princess bride inconthievable
These MCs is eatable wait edible
Im fishing with dynamite now I got a freezer full
Of rappers bastards Im ten steps ahead of you
Incredible give credit where credit due
Put passion into action
Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate generate power with my pen and pape
Stimulate you simulate you do what I incinerate
We do it for the dinner plates musical we innovate
You imitate your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it never gonna say they love what we doing on stage
Even if they dont one quote and the hate just integrates

Everywhere we deep in this shawtys gon be speaking it
Oh they so uniquely spit
The great debater the saviour the caped crusader
The alpha the omega your favorite communicator
News junky Im debunking the myth of the job creators
Departed the conversation that started indoctrination
The flow is a thing of beauty Im bringing it as my nudey
You drinking it like a smoothie theyre spinning it like a sufi
Rappers I dissect em collecting em like a souvie

Cause Ive grown to make them smashes
On this journey did many back flips
To get your attention now that I caught it
Who do I catch bitch
Real rock rap and not a Xerox
Weird not enough to make ya fear a lot from here watch
I ran scrimmage and I fought to the damn finish
And I popped eyes open without eating me canned spinach
My fans in it constantly tellin me I can win it
If I stand grimace damaging man every damn minute
I blended it expands quick it slams wicked rhyme
Grand spittage HAM with it fam dig its N9ne
Chea Hard to see me like the background
Your rap styles coming softer than a cats meow
Red laces but booted like Im Iraq bound
That frownll get you ate by my cannibal from Sac Town
So relax pal pat down gat down back down blackout
With a fat smile I might react foul
So dont make this cat growl
I caught everybody when I spazzed wow who do I catch now
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who cant get with the rap sound
I caught the industry who do I catch now
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who told me to put the rap down
I caught the whole world who do I catch now
I caught wreck AND THEN I caught checks
AND THEN I caught press AND THEN I caught sex YES
And no permanent diseases were caught when I caught that
Now the games been offset cause Im strange in a lost mess
I caught a lot of shit being different they tried to hinder Tech
By calling him devil worshiper surfaced up on the internet
My temper gets grimmer just as winter sets Im a venter yes

I caught stars attention N9na had a large ascension
So high the lord is squintin NOPE I mean yall are squintin OKAY 
Cause Im tall as Pippen  NOPE got a flawless vision OKAY 
On a lawless mission NOPE cause Im ballish pimpin YEAH 
Best believe I caught fades
Never homie soft made Im active no off days
And I got boss paid with music I caught babes
And I even caught gays before they all caught AIDS


Who do I catch now
Maybe those who cant get with the rap sound
I caught the industry who do I catch now
Who do I catch now
Maybe those who told me to put the rap down
I caught the whole world who do I catch now

You haters oughta know that we are the MO
This is my land you in my hand and yous a particle
And I see you marvel over the fact I caught Tha Carter IV
So that means I caught Martians already
And you talk shit about that because often yall petty
And because you jelly sicklin its costing yall Bettys
To get tossed in our headache cause we lost in tall fetty
Ayy you catch the vapors cause N9na he catch hoes

Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me theres a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let em tell you that theyre all the same
Oh the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake watch out 
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
Ill meet you up there where the path runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin to find a woman whos never never never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself its not as hard hard hard as it seems mm
Ah ah ah ah

The politics that follow it getting caught in it can be lethal
See I love the community cause a community will embrace you
But you turn it back the community is the people that will hate you
See everybodys striving for that same shit
To get paid and make it and Ima be honest Im tryna become famous
When someone makes a move watch that person next to you
Cause Ill warn ya
I love Hova but jealousys The Takeover
Here come the mean mugs
I cant do what he does
And where does that lead us
To the ego that feeds us
I wish that I could just do what I do
But when a door opens for him Im afraid there wont be enough room
Comparisons a mother fucker
Like MLK said
We all want that band leader syndrome and it wont stop
This concept makes me wonder is it the commodity
Of the music or the ego that is killing hiphop
And you know how I feel 
Its the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
Its the ego that makes me talk shit behind peoples back
You know that its the ego thats constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
Its the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said its the ego that has me trippin about the next man
You know that its the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want
Im so cool
For real
You know dude Im serious spit it different and if you just flow too
Ill listen lookin for glitches and rip em to shove improve
That my rhythms a little bit more intricate just to boost
My ego its so evil
Threatened by so many different kinds of people
It seems that if youre going through somethin and life is feeling uncomfortable
The immediate place you go is to your ego to comfort you
When Boom Bap got signed I hated on him
When Grayskul got signed I hated Onry
And thats hard to admit but since Im really being honest
I wanted to be one of the first to make it as a Northwest rap artist
Instead of taking it as a plus for my region
I took it as a cut to my dreams of makin it out of this political scene of
Northwest haters to be next I guess Im just like them
Jealous of whos taking that step


Its the ego that makes me not give respect in dap
Its the ego that makes me talk shit behind peoples back
You know that its the ego thats constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
Its the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged
I said its the ego that has me trippin about the next man
You know that its the ego that makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want
Now everybody got one but people trying to front
Claiming that they on the humble but cocky
Now it comes up when we judge
Or are threatened by someone
But everyone still be like man thats not me
Now let me break it down son
Its only a lack of love for ourselves
Cause were submerged in I gotta be
The best or number one
But its just that we dont trust
In our heart and thats what stops me
Its the ego",for glitches and rip em to shove improve That my rhythms a little bit more intricate just to boost My ego its so evil Threatened by so many different kinds of people It seems that if youre going through somethin and life is feeling uncomfortable The immediate place you go is to your ego to comfort you When Boom Bap got signed I hated on him When Grayskul got signed I hated Onry And thats hard to admit but since Im really being honest I wanted to be one of the first to make it as a Northwest rap artist Instead of taking it as a plus for my region I took it as a cut to my dreams of makin it out of this political scene of Northwest haters to be next I guess Im just like them Jealous of whos taking that step Its the ego that makes me not give respect in dap Its the ego that makes me talk shit behind peoples back You know that its the ego thats constantly polluting my consciousness So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it Its the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged I said its the ego that has me trippin about the next man You know that its the ego that makes me not go to the front Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want Now everybody got one but people trying to front Claiming that they on the humble but cocky Now it comes up when we judge Or are threatened by someone But everyone still be like man thats not me Now let me break it down son Its only a lack of love for ourselves Cause were submerged in I gotta be The best or number one But its just that we dont trust In our heart and thats what stops me Its the ego,Ladies and gentlemen Sekken Thaughtz on the beat And you know how I feel Big up to Lace Cadence Good lookin out for this one man I love hiphop music I just hate the ego The politics that follow it getting caught in it can be lethal See I love the community cause a community will embrace you But you turn it back the community is the people that will hate you See everybodys striving for that same shit To get paid and make it and Ima be honest Im tryna become famous When someone makes a move watch that person next to you Cause Ill warn ya I love Hova but jealousys The Takeover Here come the mean mugs I cant do what he does And where does that lead us To the ego that feeds us I wish that I could just do what I do But when a door opens for him Im afraid there wont be enough room Comparisons a mother fucker Like MLK said We all want that band leader syndrome and it wont stop This concept makes me wonder is it the commodity Of the music or the ego that is killing hiphop And you know how I feel Its the ego that makes me not give respect in dap Its the ego that makes me talk shit behind peoples back You know that its the ego thats constantly polluting my consciousness So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it Its the ego that makes the present moment jet lagged I said its the ego that has me trippin about the next man You know that its the ego that makes me not go to the front Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want Im so cool For real You know dude Im serious spit it different and if you just flow too Ill listen lookin

Many years ago I asked this cat if he could be my DJ
He said when I said forever
And ever since then my big pen
Seemed never to be able to resist when
I hear a beat I grip then
Through clarity and awe
Of where I see it all
Just cause Im rhymin from the spirit tearin free of all ego is
And please dont get it twisted never flee a star
If you ever try to block my path Im tearin through your jaw
When I write its like I get a greater sense of who I am
Way beyond this life and death every moment is new again
You gotta get into it to get into it intuitive
Synchronicity cause nothing is really coincidence
Livin for today yesterday and tomorrow
Cause its all a fleeting moment for a soul moving through time and space
And most the stuff I rhyme about some say I shouldnt talk about
But yet the words just seem to seep out way before I say em or think em
Im thinkin of a master plan

Walkin on the sky again

Live for you fresh
For all you sucker MCs perpetratin a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
Youre the kind of guy that girl ignored
Im drivin a Caddy you fixin a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle names Ward
And when Im rockin on the mic you should all applaud
Because were wheelin dealin we got a funny feelin
We rock from the floor up to the ceilin
We groove it you move it it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin
We create it relate it and often demonstrate it
Well diss a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it
Were risin suprisin and often hypnotizin
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls no braids peasyhead and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and crossfades
Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didnt fail
I couldnt wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
Im a wizard of a word thats what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
Im the master of a mic thats what I say
And if I didnt say that youd say it any way
Bust into the party come in the place
See the first things come the music in your face
Girls on the walls some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it cant be missed
And you cant leave til youre dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you cant leave until were through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade thats not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok youre not in a rut
Each and everybody out there we got the notion
We want to see yall all in motion
Just shake wiggle jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side back and forth
Were the two MCs and were gonna go off
Stand in place walk or run
Tap your feet youll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJs better than all these bands
Huh
We got all the lines and all the rhymes
We dont drop dimes and we dont do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear the pants they call the Calvin Kleins
Cause Calvin Kleins no friend of mine
Dont want nobodys name on my behind
Lee on my legs sneakers on my feet
D by my side and Jay with the beat Beat 
Jay Jay Jay Jay uh uh
We dont stop
Dont dont stop Jay 
One one two two three three

God keeps His eye on us all

Flying my bike past the gates

My mom doing the laundry
Hanging our shirts
In the dirty breeze
And after it rains
Theres a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
Its not that the colors arent there
Its just imagination they lack
Everythings the same
Nothing but the dead and dying

I was Just my fathers son
Saving my money
Dreaming of glory

8106,"A Message from Yasiin Bey Lyrics
Peace this is Yasiin
No more parties in SA
Please tell em no more parties in SA
Aint home arrest I dont need to stay
Ill leave and Ill stay away
I committed no crime any place
Why these police up in my face
Why they raiding my place
Why I dont feel safe
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
My intentions are pure in coming here
And thats for everything I love or hold dear
Umis in the building
So is my wife and my children
I committed no crime
Why is the state wasting my time
They must be out of their minds
I forgive em thats the spirit of divine
I just wanna go where Im wanted
Where Im loved stop frontin
Where I live is my choice you cannot mute my voice
Thank you Kanye West for being a real friend a real friend
A real friend
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SA
I heard your choice the first time Ill go away
And when I leave thats exactly where Ill stay
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
A country called Earth everywhere
A country called Earth everywhere
No more parties in SA
Please no more parties in SAThats just a freestyle I had to let that out Peace to all fear none this is Yasiin Bey At this present time I am currently in Cape Town South Africa and Im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason Theyre saying that they want to deport my family Uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious which it is not Anyone can do the research about the world passport its not a fictitious document It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all In fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015 You can see the stamps theyre there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate To quote Lil Durk I am not a liar Ive made no false claims I have not misrepresented myself Im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way Im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also umIts curious I havent broken any law and Im being treated like a criminal I know Im not unique in that regard and I am grateful that Im here with my family I havent been physically harmed or anything like that However I have been detained People in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily Theres no reason I have to spend any time in the cell Theres no reason I had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all This is not an administration of justice and all I seek is to leave the state Im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because Im not I just wanna go home and I dont live in America and I have the right to domicile wherever I please without fear or without interference
The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily And thats fine we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either My family and I are prepared immediately to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state never to return to this state again We dont have to be here Were not pining to be here and were complying in every possible way reasonably Just today state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family and they had no right to do so I have legal representation here who they could easily contact Theyre contravening and breaking all types of international law and its untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on And I know its been a lot of chatter about whats going on you know people are running to the press because thats justyou know a money making machine So its another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera some telenovella and I have no interest in it Furthermore related but not directly related to this Im retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today and also from Hollywood effective immediately I am releasing my final album this year Umand thats that
Peace to all fear of none Thank everyone for their time Much success to you even if you wish me the opposite as Nas said And Im on the side of the right so people could wish however they want but I aint nobodysI aint no threat or a hazard to nobody I really try to mind my business What people think about me is none of my business and Im not here to change peoples opinions about me You dont have to like me you dont have to like everything that I say The fact is is that I have hurt no one I have injured no parties and all I require as is my lawful right is innocent passage to my domicile That is all
In summary I will say this I will close with a simple prayer To the one who has created the all you know me better than I know myself and I know myself better than people know me So forgive me for whatever they know or do not know Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said Ameen ameen allahumma ameen

Loud ass country ass cocaine America
Lethal America carcinogen asthma
Carbonated smoke throughout your blood plasma
Lights and camera action surveillance

Hollywood hoes handguns
Peace to all fear none This is Bey Love One

all fear none this is Yasiin Bey At this present time I am currently in Cape Town South Africa and Im being prevented from leaving unjustly unlawfully and without any logical reason Theyre saying that they want to deport my family Uh theyre making false claims against me some of these government officials even in the press are making false claims against me saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious which it is not Anyone can do the research about the world passport its not a fictitious document It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nations state at all In fact the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015 You can see the stamps theyre there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate To quote Lil Durk I am not a liar Ive made no false claims I have not misrepresented myself Im under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way Im being treated because this is following no reasonable train of logic as also umIts curious I havent broken any law and Im being treated like a criminal I know Im not unique in that regard and I am grateful that Im here with my family I havent been physically harmed or anything like that However I have been detained People in this state have taken punitive action against me unnecessarily Theres no reason I have to spend any time in the cell Theres no reason I had to have police come to my house damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport where nobody arrested me and none of that ever happened at all This is not an administration of justice and all I seek is to leave the state Im not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing because Im not I just wanna go home and I dont live in America and I have the right to domicile wherever I please without fear or without interference The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily And thats fine we dont have to be enemies and we dont have to be friends either My family and I are prepared immediately to

Shout to them niggas family men bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone kissable nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
Thats what I named my son Knight
He was born to be one thats how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer licked by an angels tongue
Im living dangerous son she got a man a famous one
Honey be pocket watching she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death slim pickings but Im not impressed
She got the hottest sex so I guess Ima just stay

Next Friday night cant wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you dont fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you you got locked
I felt bad wait do I got love for you
I might kill you but do I got love for you
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but its love what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me I still look twenty
Still get money lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer

Them niggas get on yall ass yall play with me like I aint worse
Tryna gossip up the blogs like yall aint said my name first

What you know about popping out and trying to hit they face first
They like Smurk Your ass be tripping better put your case first
Choking who I heard them rumors niggas better play slow
I dont want no niggas who you catch I want the one I paid for
We on his ass he in the A you see how long they stay for
Aint no hotel room we pop outside the Hyatt with dracos
Hellcats they get off any scene the police chase those
Trolling ass we shot your homie we aint know he can take those
If I say your name dont post it opps be on all kind of shit
Aint got time to watch your page to see if niggas died or shit
I know bitches set you up literally niggas dying to hit

You lucky I dont be doing shit for the Gram you niggas cowards

When his goofy ass jumped in the streets His ass a hooper
I know this shit dont matter I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement he gon kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning wake him up that boy a rooster Go 
He took it to trial I tried to tell him it was stupid I knew it 
They gave him so much time his knees got weak and he was woozy Damn 
Watch the shit you say the feds be listening to the music Woah 
And they gon take your lyrics and build a case and try to use it
DA dropped my murder didnt have evidence to prove it Nah 
I think my house is haunted yeah by who The ghost of Pookie Woah 
He aint killed nobody but keep rapping about the shootings Pussy 
Still aint got revenge yet but keep making up excuses Wow 
Cuz done drank so much lean that his gut got big as Guccis Lean 
Told him quit while he ahead and dont go out like Whitney Houston Huh 
He got caught without it now they robbing him for his rubies Woah 
He wouldnt give it up so he got buried in his Cuban Its Gucci 
Better not believe no rumors rest in peace to Koopa

7872,"Second Round KO Lyrics
Yo Canibus man whats up man
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man you were booming
But I caught these foul slouchass niggas you know I mean
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard man I wasnt with that
But I aint know you well enough to defend you though right
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game man theyve been playing me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Did right you know what I mean
But they cant hurt us man we gonna do it
Get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself man
You dont got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you man get up in there move that head man
Come on to me man but when you come man
You gotta come for blood man
Come up to me man come on bust that nigga whole
Man niggas talking that shit about you
Hey Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat eat eat eat MCs for lunch breakfast
Hey man they been playing me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times did right
No but they cant hurt us man
We gonna do it get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself man
Yo Ima let the world know the truth you dont want me to shine
You studied my rhyme then you laid your vocals after mine
Thats a bitch move somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum you only droppin clues
I studied your background read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drugfree role model you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you aint got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99 of your fans wear high heels
From IceT to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me You must be crazy
You drippin with wack juice and you cant get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start nigga
Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder than that man
You dont want no bitchass niggas hanging out with me man
Were warriors man when we go into battle
We come out or dont come out at all
You better give me the respect that I deserve or Ima take it by force
Blast you with a 45 Colt make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war now you wanna talk
Its about who strikes the hardest not who strikes first
Thats why I laugh when I hear that wackass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
Its because of him now at least I know what beef is
Its not what I would call this see this is somethin different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin off of dissin
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin himself cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you somethin you might got more cash than me
But you aint got the skills to eat a niggas ass like me
And if you really want to show off we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
Ill let you kick a versefuck it Ill let you kick em all
Ill even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom your first second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say Naw he started it he forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it man you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because its been a minute Ill forget it
Fuck that Cause like Common and Cube I See the Bitch in Yoo
And Ima make the world see it too motherfucker
Ladies and gentlemen we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds Canibus
Yo Canibus man you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man you inandout and youre agile with your flow man
But dig right you got to eat man
Thats your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you but dig right
Hey Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat eat eat eat MCs
For lunch breakfast dinner thats your agenda baby
Your agenda to consume them

The most incredible baby

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Yeah yeah
Uh
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Good dude I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel firstclass to change the forecast
Never in bunches just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
Its been months since I checked back in
Were somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain four and change Armor Alld down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I cant let you know it pride wont let me show it
Pretend to be heroic thats just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry uh
Cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
On repeat the CD of Bigs Me My Bitch
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin Let me see that clip
Shopping sprees pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
Thats when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine I dont know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick let me see thats it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldnt touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbedout buggy
And then they got fuzzy and they dont remember that
And I dont remember you
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah I seen em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
A face of stone was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then
You have given away without gettin at me
Thats your fault how many times you forgiven me
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me
I know the way a nigga livin was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Shit Im a man with pride you dont do shit like that
You dont just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You dont throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin them girls I was gon get right back
They say you cant turn a bad girl good
But once a good girls gone bad shes gone forever
Ill mourn forever
Shit Ive got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes

6939,"What they give you blood
Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway You oughta be home with your momma How old are you boy
Thirteen
Thirteen Damn the bastards must be runnin outta niggas to arrest
Yeah ohh yeah this goes out
To all the families that went through the struggle
All that I got is you 
Yeah from the heart
And Im so thankful I made it through 
It was all from the heart everything was real
Yo dwellin in the past flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that Id have a baby girl and three sons
Im goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my Old Earth had so many seeds
But shes her own woman due to me I respect that
I saw life for what its really worth and took a step back
Family aint family no more we used to play ball
Eggs after school eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasnt easy
We survived winters snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly Daddy left me at the age of six
I didnt know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasnt strong enough she just went down
Check it fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed two at the foot two at the head
I didnt like to sleep with JonJon he peed the bed
Seven oclock pluckin roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon watchin Saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing every meal was no frill
In the summer free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Techs house with a note
Stating Gloria can I borrow some food Im dead broke
So embarrasin I couldnt stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin I spent stamps in stores
Mommy wheres the toilet paper use the newspaper
Look Ms Rose gave us a couch shes the neighbor
Things was deep my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy it killed me
But I remember this moms would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here why
Yeah yo
All that I got is you
And Im so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you
And Im so thankful I made it through
All that I got is you Word up mommy I love you 
And Im so thankful I made it through Word up 
All that I got is you It was all you word 
And Im so thankful I made it through You brought me in like this 
Yeah
I sit and think about
All the times we did without dad
I always said I wouldnt cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddys not here now
But some way or somehow I will always be around yeah
All the things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always oh
Yeah you say
You see the universe which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand
We got to keep it real and what reality
And reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see thats the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from heheh
Youre never gonna make it where youre goin aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And youll see a whole universe all over again
And again and again and again and again

Give my girl my crib so they have somewhere to live
Give my brothers my jewels they worth a million or 2

Let him know you recognize him as a factor

7947,"Battle wBusy Bee Harlem World 1981 Lyrics
One for the treble two for the bass
Cmon Easy Lee and lets rock the place
One two one two
Do what you do now
Hold on Busy Bee I dont mean to be bold
But put that badittyba bullshit on hold
We gonna get right down to the nittygrit
Gonna tell you little somethin why you aint shit
It aint a emcees jock that you dont hug
You even bit your name from the Lovebug
And now to bite a niggas name thats some lowdown shit Shut up Shut up 
If you was money man youd be counterfeit
I gotta give it you though you can rock
But everybody know youre on the Furious jock
And I remember Busy from the oldentimes
When my man Spoonie G used to sell you rhymes
Remember that rhyme called DittyBaDitty
Man goddamn that shit was a pity
Too hot to trot here to rock a spot
Spoonie G rocked it whether you like it or not
He begged for the rhyme asked for it twice
He says Spoonie G Ill buy at any price
When Spoonie finally sold it oh what a relief
Busy B stole it like a fuckin thief
Came out rockin the partys hard Shut up 
Got everybody thinkin that that rhymes yours Shut up 
Every time I hear it I throw a fit
Party after party the same old shit
Record after record rhyme after rhyme
Always want to know your zodiac sign
He changed the shit to the favorite jeans
Cmon Busy Bee tell me what that means
Hold on brother man dont you say nothing
Im not finished yet I gotta tell you something
Too hot to trot Im here to rock the spot
Im gonna rock your ass whether you like it or not
Ill take the title right on the spot
How can I take a title you aint got
Youre not number one youre not even the best
And you cant win no real emcee contest
Celebrity Clubs and bullshit like those
Throw the kind of shows that everybody knows
Celebrity Clubs those are the kind you can win
Theyre all set up before he comes in
But in a battle like this youd know youd lose
Between me and you who do you think theyll choose
Well if you think its you I got bad news
Because they hear your name youre gonna hear some boos
Cause youre fakin the funk cause youre fakin the funk
And at the end of this rock you can call me uncle
Moe Dee rock shock the house
Call me uncle
Rock the house yall
Like this yall alike this yall
Like thisathis its like this yall
Now you popcornpeanuttoy emcees
Never ever ever heard no rhymes likes these
Cause my intent from the time I sent
Is to say those rhymes that I invent
And for your pleasure a rhyme youll treasure
Please dont try cause you cant measure
The length of time cant touch the rhyme
Hip hop dont stop cause you know Im
An MC supreme and Im oneofakind
And if you search real hard Im sure youll find
Aint another MC who can rhyme like this
Not your mother or your father aunt brother or your sis
Sit back and enjoy dont try to fight
Cause its very hard to say any rhyme I write
But do it like this do it like that
Concentrate real hard and get the rhyme down pat
And no matter how hard you try youll see
Youll get your mind into mine and cant say it like me
But you wanna be Busy wannabe
And he know he wanna be another Kool Moe Dee
So lets all chant because you know you cant
Everybody salute to the new MC champ
Its like this yall like this yall
Like thisathis its like this yall
Now that badittybadadangdadangdang
Sound pretty good but it aint no thang
Im the super scooper party pooper
Man with all the superduper
Disco breaks have what it takes
A man who never makes mistakes

To reassure the rhymes are low

You ready to turn your fro from natural straight to a cold wave

Popped a pill now shes in your Coupe De Ville passenger seat

Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re blow me Fa So La Ti Da Ha Im tellin the truth
You suckin your tooth you treatin her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a Herringbone
From droppin her off to takin her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin the baby now she after yo ass

4661,"Some static started in the pool hall
Hit a motherfuckers face with the cue ball
And I met this girl she tried to gank me
So I smacked her in the booty with a plank B
Cause me and my crew were out breaking windows
The bingo the lotto you know Ill never win those
Possession is half the law I had my routines before all yall
Your whole life is coming apart at the seams
You aint nothing but a car thief biting routines
See Im a city slicker I I aint no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie
And like Ricky always said youve got to toke and pass
Or Mookies gonna kick your motherfucking ass
Try to take what isnt yours like a god damn rat
See I personally I wouldnt even wanna go out like that
Im a writer a poet a genius I know it
I dont buy cheeba I grow it Im a farmer 
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a moneyhungry miser
Had a cainefilled Kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You cant deny me you always want to try me
Yo youre just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
Smoking that dust at St Anthonys Feast
All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rope chain when hes walking the beat
So like a sneaky pouch timebomb ticking
Alike the beat to my rhyme just kicking
Space cake cookies I discover who I am
Im a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man
Fiveoh caught me now Im going to the mountains
Said goodbye to my girl my lawyer and accountants
My mind is kinda rhyming and I think I oughta think
So Im rockin all the rhymes and Ill have another drink
So the lights are flashing my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning of another rhyme
Im rapping emceeing I rock
You aint nothing but a car thief who must be stopped

5890,"Aha uh yeah yo
Im the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery voice of God
And its hard just being the boss
Being I cant go to jail cause them yearsll cost me
Dont get me wrong lay a nigga down if he force me
Id rather just sit back and roll a Dutch
Think about how Ima put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how Ima get the caine over customs
Never underestimate niggas or overtrust them uh
Yeah them Ms is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it dont jam the TEC will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause Im a nigga that hate to settle
And Im a man of the Lord but I still cant shake the devil
Moved away and still cant escape the ghetto what
The time to talk is up so bring the heat playtime is over
While youre runnin your mouth Im creepin up over your shoulder
A gun a knife a bat a brick anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff start acting up and Ill leave you underground
I know how to get my peers off me
Make em cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
Its a symptom if you bobbing your head you know that hes sick
You know the flow is ridic now throw him a grip
When I get it you already know Im throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere daddy Im throwing them nicks
Thats right homie you cant move me
I aint going nowhere Im in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze a bootleg Uzi
Im just waiting on a Q like Suzie dont lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else thatll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is what up
The time to talk is up so bring the heat playtime is over
While youre runnin your mouth Im creepin up over your shoulder
A gun a knife a bat a brick anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff start acting up and Ill leave you underground
Niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you cant do nothing other than flow
Lifes a bitch like the mother from Blow lets go
Dont make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat nigga I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy fresh and new
In the six but its a BM and its Pepsi blue
And I dont know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Yall aint fuckin with Jason
After I cash in theres really no justification
Of how Im gon change the game so dont get out of line
Cause this little nine will change your frame what up

Because you know if you just do not want me this time around

Make up your mind where or when
If you dont want me now
Give or take you only got two hundred days
Because I aint coming down this way too much more again
You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think you are just a little too late
So Im coming down into this world daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And Im going to sit up in your bed mama
And just grin right in your face
And then Im going to eat up all your chocolates
And say I hope Im not too late

Boy you got that six in the morning
You got that thing thatll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy you got me lonely
Just say the words Ill do anything you want
Boy let me love you
Uh I know that you think Im the one but who doesnt
It comes with the territory when you buzzin
A ball player sold you a dream aint do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt but whos judging
I aint trying to guide you hand on Bible
But Instagram pics show more than side views
Thirtydollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So no cuffing no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone shes just bluffin
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin
If anybody else do ask we just nothing
Boy you got that six in the morning
You got that thing thatll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy you got me lonely
Just say the words Ill do anything you want
Boy let me love you
Hey mama come fuck with the shotta
With the Givenchy toppa shoe Balenciaga
If you act right I can match you up proper
If its about a dollar thing big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
Dont listen to your best friend she dont matter
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in seethrough V1 V2
Chanel or Celine however I see you
Christians or Chloe damn them Cs too
You know I play fair Im Daddy Day Care
I know it aint cheap for you to lay here
Boy you got that six in the morning
You got that thing thatll make a girl feel high
Oh I say boy you got me lonely
Just say the words Ill do anything you want
Boy let me love you

Saturday I said Im sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasnt hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive

Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If Im crazy then its true
That its all because of you
And you wouldnt want me any other way

Drop 2 Fast

You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatcha gon do Act a fool
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy whatcha gon do Act a fool
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon do Act a fool
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy whatcha gon do Act a fool
Talkin about gats traps cops and robbers
Its 911 please call the doctor
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece we gon split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and overstepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold stay the fuck around me
Ya peeps talkin bout What kinda shits he on
You disappear like Poof bitch be gone
You think twelve gon catch me Gimme a break
Im supercharged with the hideaway license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
Theyll only get one finger while Im shifting gears
I got suede on my roof wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug Golden Grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front back and side to side what
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon do Act a fool
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy whatcha gon do Act a fool
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon do Act a fool
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy whatcha gon do Act a fool
Lets take it to the streets cause Im ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
Its my cars birthday so we blowin them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest read it and weep
NOS tank in the back camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club I get all the affection
Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
Im about to take off so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin bird
And the fools we gon clock one and well pop one
Cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon do Act a fool
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon do Act a fool
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth
Boy whatcha gon do Act a fool
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what Im gon do Act a fool
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See Im off that antifreeze and my car is tipsy
Off the offramp doin about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin and we startin shit
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire cause we stomped you out
And yeah we blow trees and beez thats fantastic
So girls hold ya weave while Im weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
Youll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
Its one mission two clips and some triple beams
Im about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon do Act a fool
Man that aint sticky thats just sticks and stems
Boy whatcha gon do Act a fool
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies whatcha gon do Act a fool
If the bottles all gone and your eyes are red

6720,"TranslationsPortugusDeutschEnglish2Pac Dear Mama Arabic Translation  
You are appreciated
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face
Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And whod think in elementary hey
Id see the penitentiary one day
And runnin from the police thats right
Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend Mama
You always was a black queen Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it
Theres no way I can pay you back but the plan
Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama 
Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated 
Sweet lady dont you know we love ya
Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and I didnt cry
Cause my anger wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hotplate
You just workin with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough youre alone
Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan
Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama 
Sweet lady place no one above ya You are appreciated 
Sweet lady dont you know we love ya
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
Its a struggle every day gotta roll on
And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan
Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont you know we love ya Dear Mama

Visible preference is pure patent it back to metaphors
Greetin em Illadelstyle wild
Analyze my memoirs runnin on 84 poetic meter
Soarin way beyond
Iambic pentameter or juvenile flam
Unsyncopated soul piercin earlobes and egos
My vocals read these thoughts am I hardcore
To the grain
Lame game plain Jane MCs cant approach these
I shake chumps like fleas I hold the keys
To drive you guide you provide you
With the real joints ahem I clear my throat of phlegm

To rid the game of nuisance

Lines that I supply fortify the nuclei of mindstate
From state to state universal be the orals that I create
Top notch and on lock like Sentry opponents could never tempt me
Samplin my style like an Akai S950 and still cant get with me

6087,"Big Daddy vs Dolemite Lyrics
Mmm ohh yeah
Mmm mmm mmm ohh yeah
Allow me to introduce myself
As the Big Daddy Kane
A smooth lover from around the way
Thats bound to drive any bitch insane
Well Dolemite is my name
And rappin and tappin is my game
Oh yeah Well me tell you somethin Mr Dolemite
The shit you talkin years ago I could see
But its the 90s now and rap is all about me
Listen when it comes down to rappin
I was THROUGH with it before you learned what to do with it
Im the KING so Im stakin my claim
In the rappin game
Yknow For all players I am the speaker
Im also known as the hot pussy seeker
When it comes down to ridin up and down in some pussy
I make it weaker
Also it gets a little deeper
I was walkin down Broadway the other day
An old old lady came my way
She said Ill be glad when you come 18
Im gonna give you a funkin like you aint never seen
I said LADY Why wait for so much time to pass
Ive been WANTIN to tear up yo old gray ass
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The ho took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
That Oh Mr Dolemite take that motherfucker OUT
Well you aint sayin nothin slick to a can of oil
I walked barefoot from New York to Dallas
Won for Pimp of the Year at the Caesars Palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean til that shit was dry
I was makin money before Washington was put on a bill
And I kicked Jacks ass and took his ho Jill
Im the one who broke the bulls back
And made people say FUCK McDonalds and call ME the Big Mac
Why you long lanky motherfucker
You aint nothin but a sucker
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
Shot in the ass with two Colt 45s
Ive been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I chew up railroad iron and shit out steel
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale

He was like no cadet theyd ever seen
A man so hard his veins bleed ice
When he speaks he never says it twice
They call him Judge his last name is Dredd
So break the law and youll wind up dead
Truth and justice are what hes fighting for
Judge Dredd the man he is the law
Drokk it
With his gun and bike he rules the streets
Every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even Death will overcome his might
Dredd and Anderson they won the fight
When the Sovs started the Apocalypse war
MegaCity was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted and the judges fought back
Crushed the Sovs with their counterattack

Broadcasting live from Harlem New York Yeah 
Let the truth be known
You better watch what the fuck flies out of your mouth
Or Ima hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC
Cause AIDSinfested child molesters arent sicker than me
I see the world for what it is beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer cause God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My wordsll expose George Bush and bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same sevenheaded dragon
And you cant fathom the truth so you dont hear me
You think Illuminatis just a fuckin conspiracy theory
Thats why conservative racists are all runnin shit
And your phone is tapped by the federal government
So Im jammin frequencies in your brain when you speak to me
Techniquell rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally cause Im never hesitant
Sniperscopin a commission controllin the president
Father forgive them for they dont know right from wrong
The truthll set you free written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life thatll save your soul
Save your soul motherfucker save your soul
Yeah yeah yeah
I hacked the Pentagon for selfincriminating evidence
Of Republicanmanufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps flak vest with the guns and ammo
Spittin bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line
So heres the truth about the system thatll fuck up your mind
They gave alQaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldnt destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watchin the towers and though I wasnt the closest
I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge
Four nonArabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama and they said it was proof
Jealous of our freedom I cant believe you bought that excuse
Rockin a motherfuckin flag dont make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The Devil crept into Heaven God overslept on the seventh
The New World Order was born on September 11th
Father forgive them for they dont know right from wrong
The truthll set you free written down in this song
And the song has the cause of death written in code
The word of God brought to life thatll save your soul
Save your soul motherfucker save your soul
And just so conservatives dont take it to heart
I dont think Bush did it cause he isnt that smart
Hes just a stupid puppet takin orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin and lockin
Lookin for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact Rumsfeld now that I think back
Without 911 you couldnt have a war in Iraq
Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion
Tax cut extortion a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney you fuckin leech tell em your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggas fooled but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
Thats why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth I dont scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis
In 98 when he was top ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the government lies
Read it yourself instead of askin the government why
Cause then the cause of deathll cause the propaganda to die

And the bubbles in the Hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Never try to jack you gon lose cause like Cube Ima kill at will
And motherfuckers wanna take my style
Cause niggas out here know Im only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let yall niggas play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin 8 Ball MJG
Twista bitch and I from the Chi

She scheming dreaming wishing she can be my number one
Forever young mama I just wanna have some fun
Dont try to ever take my cash from me
You might as well jump off a cliff you fucking crash dummy
Like thats my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin back at perpetrators
We dont discriminate well hurt now and hurt you later
But I aint worried Ill smoke one of you fucking haters
And now Im higher than gators on the refrigerator

Now Im on the corner takin penitentiary chances
Even though theres marks on my turf that cant stand me
Think to myself one should I leave
Two say fuck em and continue hit my weed
I guess Im a G about my scrilla cause they dashin
Fools know that P is quick to put em in the casket
The game got me stressin but the P aint gon stress out
Even though the task just raided a niggas house
Took a loss in the game tryin to bubble up
Find the P deep in the grind slangin the dope fiends double ups

Gold ones on my vehicle fools they cant see me though
Tens for twenty nigga thats plenty meet me at the liquor store
Fiends want credit but cha know I cant fade ya
And when you get yo cash together call me on my pager

Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed self built do
Down to the mink pelts gator belts and silk suit
If I cant stack a nigga cap get peeled loose

It seems hes drowned

Chewing through your Wimpy dreams

Keep growin
Keep growin
Keep growin
Its like we more like brothers than nephew and uncle
Comin up at times seem survival is like a jungle
Understanding takes time some lessons we gotta go through
I remember when we was young and the price tag on those days and nights
Cant be measured or bought
Sometimes I wish we could bring em back
Sundays at church comin home from work
Kept it on the low you lent me two dollars for them burritos
Headed out to the bay to focus on dreams
Sometimes I feel I shoulda been there for guidance
But I was learnin what it means to be a man still am
And every time I think I figured it out the universe expands
We was supposed to bring you out on the road
When dough got ripe
We aint even had a chance to chill its just not right man
I guess the street life had other plans but Im gonna see you in a minute doe

5991,"BoyzNTheHood remix LyricsCruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin shit
Donald B in the place to give me the pace
He said My man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulls out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead LA Times front page
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath start stinkin
Love to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb h says somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the h
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a rightcross cold knocked him out
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin 
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped my 64 round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a u they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin 
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the County Jail
Two days later in Municipal Court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire then came Suzy
The came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didnt hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card

7064,"Look somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow silk sheets and a satin pillow
This California king loved you like a sack of indo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos
Master suite frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like a blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
Know wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just dont look down at your feet
Look
Told this world I was a star Im gon need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
We used to be respected now they laughin
Weve turned into possessions with no passion
How we go from the best to less than average
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
With no collective identity 
You You You You
Its every man for himself 
Me Me Me Me
We need a black mafia 
Us We We
Look 
Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit
I think too much TV is what ruins kids
When homosexual actors is their influences
We need community centers that teach the music biz
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit
Dont take no hand outs you build it its more lucrative
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit
You get abused long enough you start abusing shit
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way
He shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
And once you found the real its hard to tolerate the plastic
I aint no Christian aint no Catholic but I believe
God gon shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that Im asking
We used to be connected who detached us
Who Who Who Who
No separation 
Who Who Who Who
You You You You
Divide and conquer 
Me Me Me Me
Its the Art of War 
Us We We
Who detached us
Look 
Death is the destination we all share No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Lifes change agent It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life
Dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking
Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition They somehow already know what you truly want to become Everything else is secondary
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish
It was their farewell message as they signed off
And now I wish that for you
Stay Hungry Stay Foolish

6686,"Ah one two ah one two
Ah one two ah one two
Id like to introduce myself
My name is ah Biz Markie
Well Im the human orchestra called Biz Markie
Makin music orally is my specialty
When I go BOOM ah one two girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite em
I know yall in the mood just go with the flow
And I can play rappin records and all disco
Like Beat It Billie Jean by Michael Jackson
Or the Treacherous Three record they call Action
When you hear me do it you will be shocked and amazed
Its the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Make the music with your mouth biz
Biz Markie beatboxes
Well I dont just do the beatbox I rock on the mic
And all the rhymes that I say all the people like
I get the crowd jumpin get the girls hearts pumpin
All the party people say Isnt he somethin
Rock from New York City all the way down South
Sayin rhymes and makin music with my mouth
Imma tell you party people how I began
It started when Im livin in Long Island
Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Makin sounds with my mouth all sorts of beats
Grown people used to say WHAT
Grown people used to say WHATS
wrong with that kid makin that strange noise
It was like for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboys basement party
They thought it was a record they aint know it was me
When they came by the DJ and saw who it is
They said Make the music with your mouth Biz
song continues as just a beat for a while
It may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox
But its real difficult even knocked me out my socks
Its a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
I like doin it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
Its not all about spittin breathin hard and chewin
You need practice be ambitious in the schoolin
Let me tell you party people you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
Thats why I like doin sounds thats hard to achieve
Makin two or three sounds at one time you cant believe
When I walk down the street people crowd around me
And say HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time Biz Markie
I tell em it takes a lot of practice and lip control
Ive been doin it since fifteen years old
And everywhere I do it the people say Im good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
Im tellin you a fact its just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say Whattup Biz
Everywhere I go I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say Im the best
But Im guaranteed to pass any kind of test
I say def rhymes with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS
You heard the beginning now heres the sequel
All human beatboxes is not created equal
Thats why Im here to say today
That Im doin my beat in a special way
Makin musical tunes orally I have perfected
Im very well known and greatly respected
I like to thank people without no doubt
Peace hi party people its time to break ou
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
Make the music make the music
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth
MAKE THE MUSIC with your mouth

Funny ass niggas will act funny style
Funny howâtheyâwant you slowedâdown when you running round
Be ableâto lift you up but they will gun you down
Plan is expand and travel throughout the land
Some scam some blam some niggas go hand in hand

Got the picture but never the frame in the same day

On a mission looking for God you brought the devil here
I dont like your energy homie it shouldnt settle here

2178,"Lady B Goode Lyrics
It was down in Louisiana right there in New Orleans
Back there in the 60s was a little teen queen
Fell then the lassie in love with a lad
Till it took him to vindicate take the feelings she had
She pleaded as she promised every prayer she could
Till everybody whispered to her Lady B Goode
She followed him around where he would play his guitar
Till he got so popular they made him a star
Then she could only see him on a TV screen
And hoped someday that hed come back to New Orleans
Everybody liked her and was knocking on wood
But soon there came a baby from the Lady B Goode
She wondered if hes ever coming back someday
The brighter lights and glory may just keep him away
But then he wrote and told her Do not be dismayed
The love you have for me will never be betrayed
They want me do a movie about my livelihood
And I want you to play the part of Lady B Goode
She went to see the movie when it hit the screen
Babysitting Johnnie Jr down in New Orleans
He saw his daddy sing the song he heard in school
The one his mother told him about the golden rule
Tears filled her eyes when they misunderstood
When everybody knew that she was Lady B Goode
",Lady B Goode She wondered if hes ever coming back someday The brighter lights and glory may just keep him away But then he wrote and told her Do not be dismayed The love you have for me will never be betrayed They want me do a movie about my livelihood And I want you to play the part of Lady B Goode She went to see the movie when it hit the screen Babysitting Johnnie Jr down in New Orleans He saw his daddy sing the song he heard in school The one his mother told him about the golden rule Tears filled her eyes when they misunderstood When everybody knew that she was Lady B Goode,Lady B Goode Lyrics It was down in Louisiana right there in New Orleans Back there in the 60s was a little teen queen Fell then the lassie in love with a lad Till it took him to vindicate take the feelings she had She pleaded as she promised every prayer she could Till everybody whispered to her Lady B Goode She followed him around where he would play his guitar Till he got so popular they made him a star Then she could only see him on a TV screen And hoped someday that hed come back to New Orleans Everybody liked her and was knocking on wood But soon there came a baby from the

Through the fisheyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
Im spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination open the priesthole
And if Im in Ill tell you Whats behind the wall 
Shot Yahoo 
Theres a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if youre sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone
Would you send me packing
Or would you take me home
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but
Just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut
Hello Listen I think Ive got it
Okay listen its a Hahahaha

I get on my jawn when I perform I grab the bull by the horns

Kings who pull strings like a Stradivarius

Sharper than the academy of arts and sciences

Try try again I rule the night with an iron fist
An indication that youre close to dying I am this

5061,"Yeah
I turned 21 in prison locked up at night
Now I walk around free it seems like another life
Another roll with some other dice
Another ho or a loving wife
People come and go some really you never know
Intellectual midgets that really never grow
Fake love that hangs on like can I hold you though
And old friends will look at you like yo yea I told you so
A toast to the brokenhearted
Who never finished what they fuckin started
People who go out and try to be a rebel at night
Try to make up for the fact that they settled in life
Its like a fight between the devil and Christ over the limelight
Spiritual celebrity poker
But the whole deck is full of jokers
And every year that you get older
The stakes get higher
Gambling with a bunch of fakes and liars
Real talk cause the real New York
Is the pain and the suffering of lost love
Staring off into the distance in the midst of the club
Depression and emptiness that lead to suicide
And the struggle inside of yourself that keeps you alive
Survived and medicated stalked by sobriety
The life that you live now tortured by memories violently
I pray inside of me that one day you could be forgiven
For murdering the beautiful world we used to live in
Crimes of the heart
Crimes of the heart
Love doesnt need a complicated metaphor
And sometimes nothin needs to be said at all
Sometimes a person youre with is not your one and only
And you just fuck with them because you afraid to be lonely
And when you come back its too late
So you overcompensate like victims of rape full of selfhate
Lost in the affection to strangers around you
Instead of the only person that ever gave a fuck about you
Thought you were happy so you didnt come check me
But then when he cheated or treated you incorrectly
You conveniently realized you could never forget me
And tried to crawl back in my life unexpectedly
These are my indictments of those who claim to be righteous
And leave a trail of broken hearts on their way to enlightenment
But I cant give into hatred or pass judgment
Even towards every illusion Ive been in love with
Cause the heart that betrays itself willingly
Is like a nation that trades freedom for stability
Its so seductive to be cold and corrupted
And isolated and try to be an independent republic
But liberty to be loved on the surface is worthless
The sacrifice of revolution with no purpose
Take it from a criminal searching for his redemption
Cursing at God desperately trying to get his attention
Crimes of the heart
Crimes of the heart
Looking for the shining light
Whos it gonna be
Wholl walk the line with me tonight
Round we go wont cross
Climbing through the endless night
Whos it gonna be
Wholl walk the line with me this time
Climbing through the endless night
Endless night
Crimes of the heart

The California top just falls back like autumn

Get over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spankee
Excuse me young lady I dont mean to trouble ya
But youre lookin so fly inside your BMW

Before I got busy I slipped on the mitten
Cant get better odds because Im a sure thing
Proud Mary keeps on turning and rolling like a RingDing
Jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
Doowah diddy and bust in with the preroll
Customs jailed me over an herb seed
Dont rat on your boy over some rat weed
Im outta your back door Im into another

Not perfect grammar always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds
Roses are red the sky is blue
I got my barrel at your neck so what the fuck you gonna do

Rollin like a Mack truck waxin those who talk junk

Wanna see your dome bust sucker cause I dont care
Nuttin bout you your crew because you talk shit

If youre in my way then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool the microphone of doom
Mission thats to cure all punks as I bust caps

Try to kick game but end up talkin weak shit yo
Youre weak youre wack you need to quit you lil punk bitch

You think Im violent but listen and you will find

Claim of mine designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand youre dealt
screaming Ah ahh ahh AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Cause theres no let up you walked into a set up
Its suckin you down and now you cant get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk I go head up
I aint no fool and new jack poppin fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul where only facts are kept
Many rappers sellout pop and other MCs slept
I aint in no playin mood so nigga watch your step
Cause if you cross the boss you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy dont diss the Syndicate
Cause when we chose to move youre gone
And no remains theyll find
My Lethal Weapons my mind
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
An assassinator if the people aint steppin
More bodies than John Gotti the Lethal Weapon is slaying
Just open any book thats ammo to the brain
What really matters is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon many pages
From Martin Luthers dream to Hitlers psycho rage
Whats more powerful the brain or a twelve gauge
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence I really have to disagree
Its entertainment like Terminator on TV
But somell never see youre stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapons the mind
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
A lethal weapon
An assassinator if the people aint steppin
The mind
Think

Put you in the urn your bones will burn

And a dick for you bullets and a clip for you

Bury the hatchet matter of fact bury the casket
Kill niggas bury the ratchet

And pump niggas out for the practice
The shit starter the shit finisher I dont know whats harder
When they release ya or when they sentence ya

Ready to dig a nigga shit like a colonic I go off
I know its them again from last time remember them

A nigga move around with the Eagle
I go off We say you get it if we dont believe you
This is 50 Cent and Beanie Sigel I go off
Big Pop of the prop on deck
Versace or LVs on the specks
My Gucc Los light up the ground when I step
Look beat it the kid aint mine I contest
I suggest you aim above neck
The vest cover the chest the pine cover the Heck
ler and Koch I dont rock for the cops
Horse with the stick in the hands of the jock
Everyday gear that I wear on the block
Can you picture me rolling Can you see clear like Pac 
Who shot ya Who want beef with Big Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you like Chaka Khan Im the don
Make niggas talk through the wire like Kan
A trip to the morgue turn a duck to a dime
You can catch me on my shit stuck to a grind
On a mission tryna turn a buck outta dime
Or in the kitchen tryna turn a fuck outta nine
Nigga listen I earned every buck that was mine
I aint never cry over a fuckin dime dont make me go off

Because you sippin on that Henny and my bitch will get the semi

I know niggas upstate doin life with they pops

The chain cool but you dont look right in a watch
So give it up smooth yeah or the riflell pop
Well get you some shoes probably look nice in the box
Flow smooth light on my feet like Heav D
Money Earnin all day but I aint from Mount V
Just threw a bell on the scale of the tree

Without rap I could double on a D
Shitt make it snow in a blizzard like Jeez

You dont really wanna see me in the streets dont make me go off

Back when Dot was hangin out at Tops in the Benzo
Freestylin to them Chronic instrumentals no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin rentals in front of Centennial
Remedial thoughts never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic fuck bitches ride around bouncin shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck to dishraggin bitches
That was hard to fuck I came up it was hardly luck
Just left Compton and I aint have to use my AK
What a day what a day
Back when my drivers license was babyfaced and triflin
I made my way through crisis I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens I made you hate the vibrant
You cant escape the tyrant you cant relate where Ive been
In 98 my problem actin too grown and shit
Cappin at bitches yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me thats on me
Raise up nigga you are not the homie
Bitch Im wellconnected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin with Tetris if your block neglectin your ki
Every day I wake up with my face up to my Father
Makin sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my green and stuff and double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality my dj vu done caught up
Bitch Im brought up with the homies thats on me
247 Kendrick reverend these cold streets
Dog we live by it die by it then reincarnate
And if Game told me Drive by it I raise AK

When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers

4660,"The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine
I didnt think much about it
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night
I couldnt stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that that would be the
Last theyd see of me
And I never went home again
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what hed say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said
Youre no son no son of mine
Youre no son no son of mine
You walked out you left us behind
And youre no son no son of mine
Oh his words how they hurt me Ill never forget it
And as the time it went by I lived to regret it
Youre no son no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
Youre no son no son of mine
But I came here for help I came here for you
Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away
In and out of hiding places
Soon Id have to face the facts
Wed have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what hed say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said
Youre no son no son of mine

Ever seen a young girl growing old
Trying to make herself a bride

Baby
Once I was a young man
And all I thought I had to do was smile
You are still a young girl
And you bought everything in style
Listen
But once you think youre in youre out
Cause you dont mean a single thing without
The handbags and the gladrags
That your grandad had to sweat so you could buy
Ooh
Sing a song of sixpence for your sake
And take a bottle full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake
And bake them all in a pie

This is me and you head to head lets go
Here we go beat down round two
Heads up punk cause it all comes down to
Me and you face to face head to head
Mic to mic I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn Beats nitro
Lyrics weak say goodnight yo
Star Trek shades man cut the joke
Lets get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pit bull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr Pitiful
Heres some mouthwash G
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap C
AUSE youre riding me

Stop biting chewing swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son I need jock relief
Heres a toothpick now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it Yeah finished Burp 
Now let a real man go to work
Cause Im a whip you like your daddy beat ya like a baby
Sic ya like a dog dropping lyrics with rabies
Cut ya like a knife cause youre nothing but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
Im a treat ya like a hooker punk change your clothes
Put you on the streets in with ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and Ill keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
Youre trying to come off and dont know how to come
Youre young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
Ill do you with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
My lyrical beat down will leave ya in a coma
Cause you cant hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue youre out of your league
Youre running out of gas and youre tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart cause hes petro
Take youre whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies tears or violins
Get your black suits cause I aint smiling
Im shooting the gift of gab brother youre ripped in half
Soon as the mic is passed you wont live to laugh
If theres laughter Ill get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So whos got no style look at your profile
You cant dance cant dress and youre so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your game plan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you aint got a chance in hell
Youll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one one too often
Came with a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they wont show ya
When I finish your mama wont know ya
Cause Ima rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read He had no win
So RIP Rest in peace ripped em
DID dead indeed did em
An HIT hitman so whatcha hit him with 
A rhyme silencer I hit him with a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
Ill hit ya wit a death blow
Kill em kill em 
Kill em kill em 
If mama said knock me out come do it
You cant win and that scratch knew it
Ima send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
Youre out of here over finished all in
And Marley Marl cant save you from fallin
Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn Another dumb move
You cant go hard youre just soso Todd
Im that type of guy Oh my God
Its gets no rougher comes no weaker
Marley hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because Im a rock up L
Low life loser life like luna
Lackadaisical listless luna
Tic liver lifeless living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league lard larcenist liar
Label ledger left the leper liar
Bull lull lateral learning
Laps languid latent lurking
Languish language local logo
Light laboring limited loco
Now LLs a laughing stock
Cause I lit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now youre down to a broken L
Your records aint hot and your shows dont sell
Yo tell em how you fell L Hard as hell 
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it whos your daddy
Kill em kill em
Make you say Daddy I dont want none 
I did em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the to the to the get him out of here
Yeah
So for all those hip hop fans out there that really know what time it is
Anybody that wants to see us get this thing going on headtohead Kool Moe Dee versus LL

Cause you know I do the things he wont do
You can tell him that we best of friends or we just met
Tell him that you hate my guts that was just sex
Can say we never kissed those were just pecks
Tell him put your phone down that was just a text
Or tell him you cherish our bond on the weekly
Or how you jump in my arms when you see me
Tell him I threw on the charm it was easy
Its to the point now where your mom wanna meet me
Tell him I think youre beautiful
Tell him all the wild shit that I do to you
Would he approve of that Or would his world be shattered
And if you didnt care would it really matter
Wait could say it aint the ride or the whips
But tell him the size of the ship
Or just tell him you were tired of his shit
And I reminded you of how live it gets
Tell him you dont feel appreciated
Tell him with me its alleviated
Incomparable
How I do things that he wouldnt dare to do
Or act like I aint affraid to take it there with you
Wait as a matter a fact
Tell him he could be mad at the fact
You finally met a nigga that aint mad at your past
Or tell him he can be mad at the past
You get his call and he asks what you doing just say With your friends
And while you on that phone waiting for him to hang up girl Ill be here
Ready to take over
Your bodys yearning for what he cant give
And I know just how yalls story gon end
Once I give it to you babe
Tell him you mourn him tell him youre on it tell him you cant see your life without me

When all your good days behind you yeah thats for real 
When theres no sofa to recline to yeah thats for real 
And you just constantly have to pay a due yeah thats for real 
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money
Eybody gonna say you done changed
And ery motherfucka think ery other motherfucka tryin to find a new hold in the game
See it aint nothin but the real
Niggas gettin killed for the materialistic
Hoes on the hunt for a quick trick
Aint shit shakin but the leaves in them trees
Yo motherfuckin knees and my goddamn car keys
I know it aint really shit to it but to do it
But trying I usually go through it
But so we do it like a mack in fact I keep my cool
You ask me who my master is I say my gun rules
It choose only to make moves with a certain pack
The real pack cause them bustas try to hold you back
In fact I could name a few but I aint gon waste
No precious time talkin about them on my precious tape
Pussy suckain disguise undercover
Fake brothastryin to come between another
Just like a wedge and some wood
Tryin to put a split in your shit slick busta up to no good
As I kick back smoke a beedi with the needy
Societys gettin greedy aint no future in your peace treaty
They try to label every rapper in the industry
Especially if he speaks of Hennessy and independency
If youre real
When hard times seem to find you yeah thats for real 
When all your good days behind you yeah thats for real 
When theres no sofa to recline to yeah thats for real 
And you just constantly have to pay a due yeah thats for real

Who am I
Its 8Bizzal
Do you recall
Mr Big Mr Big
In your trunk splittin wigs
Mane thats the same time I could recollect
Young trick in my face asking me if I claim sets
And heres this other fool with dreads growin from his head
He tryin to tell me bout some shit Farrakhan said
I try to listen cause 8ball aint the one to knock it
But I cant hear over the echo from my empty pocket
Instead of sweating me fool sweat Chuck D
Cause I been true to playa shit since 83
Southern funkadelic preacher Im here to reach ya
Dont be so prejudiced and let my holy words teach ya
I never rap about sets cause I aint been through that
Even though a nigga did dirt and packed straps
I dont do what you do and you dont see what I see
Therefore we could not be the same do you feel me
I come from Tennessee and love drinkin Hennessy
Peace to KRS but heres my philosophy
I got the remedy four seconds after now
Yo my nig tell em who you is
Who am I
MJG Pimp Tight
Knock on wood twice pour the drinks dim the lights
What I say is every day POetry
The REAL same shit that I sell
Hell you gon do yo thang Im gon do mine
Fine Im gon sip some wine
You might find some other way to pass your time
It aint bout where you from its bout what you do
And doin wrong gon make clues so trouble gon stick to you
True blue pimp shit is hard to break
But playa hatin bustas put the icin on the cake
Hate to see they own homies with a few ends
And still wonder why they cant get no dividends
A man aint who he say he is
If he gotta give false information bout what he had and how he live
And dont shit but the truth set you free
So trick stop all that lyin get those shackles way from me
He who tells the first lie gets the first smack
A chain react on the mack flossin fake facts
A freaky naked hoe makes no record deal
Perpetrators get for real
When hard times seem to find you yeah thats for real 
When all your good days behind you yeah thats for real 
When theres no sofa to recline to yeah thats for real 
And you just constantly have to pay a due yeah thats for real 
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money
Eybody gonna say you done changed
And ery motherfucka think ery other motherfucka tryin to find a new hold in the game
See in my past I thought it was all in my mind
But in time I came to find people are blind
To the fact I dont give a fuck about your thoughts
Motherfuck the radio and fuck the magazine talk
Walk with the playa down the highway of what I say
Hear what I say is just another way to make me paid
Instead of gettin sprayed or runnin from police
I am in the studio smoked out bustin rhymes
And jealous hoes male and female
Been givin a nigga hell now that I am 
Jealous of the fact that my mack is not an act
Instead of packin gats Im strapped with my DATs
And all my homies slang dope for a livin
Or livin in a prison cause they couldnt fade the system
I miss them but still I gots to get up on my 
Im on a mission so the future wont see me in prison
Niggas come to me with demos of they poetry
I try to listen cause I used to be that nigga G

Your heads numb so your brains a miss this
Pick em up eat em up pick em up heat em up
Pick em up picklehead pick em up picky
I roll wit globs and I come real sticky
Grippin the mic I plug it up in your ears
Crazed and brewer Im coming out like beers
Like Rheingold Miller Coors and Buds
Im a eat em wit popcorn and treat em like suds you duds
Coming out the wick wack wicky wickable wack
Black jack thats a fact writing exact behind your back
The funk rhymen master blaster
Kicking up in a brainstorm rainstorm
Rap storm rap form
Rap time rap rhyme
Rap class Im here to fail and to pass
To continue furthermore on the hype tip
I roll and rock rock and roll
Jazz and pop rhythm and Blues
Dance and fusion brain confusion
Look at the lights what a night on the town
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast
Now Im back to funk freak the funk
Hype the funk swipe the funk and all that junk
I get busy on em communicate wit the world
Man woman a baby boy and a girl
Poppa large looking out the bombs drop
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop
Stop look learn to read learn to write
Learn to talk learn to walk
And watch your step though Im hype and ripe though
Kleptomaniac a rhymen psycho
A Ricky Ricardo a Guy Lombardo
Sporting a ragtop an El Dorado
Step into Hollywood Im screening the boulevards
The rhymes is gain type Im ready to pull a card
Jacka Ace Kinga Queen
Call me the deuce Im pouring out like juice
Hitting the top feeling the rim
Getting a trim I never rhyme like them
On and on on and on on and on
Until the break of dawn
I go overtime rock the mic in nighttime
Daytime switching off to Primetime
Pacific east strolling back in the west time
Ride the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme
Hype and dope hype the frame
The mic is smoking yo I aint joking
Rhyme to kill rhyme to murder rhyme to stomp
Rhyme to ill rhyme to rock
Rhyme to smack rhyme to shock rhyme to roll
Rhyme to destroy any decoy boy
On the microphone
Im Poppa Large big shot on the East coast
Youre dripping sweaty coming hard on your neck
As I flow and grow from head to toe
Seeking a style like John McEnroe
Dissing em all serving them wit the mic stand
Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band
The crowd is live you can play as the manager
Run wit the money I pull the trigger and damage ya
Boom taking life more serious
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious
Rhymes are grip tight program to kill more
A son of Sam how could I be Gilmore
Grabbing the mic you see the dark and shadows
Youre in living hell without time to battle
The funk ignited hands are writing brains dividing
Im coming out in sighting
Like Im Blackula a better man that Dracula
Spectacular and not irregular
In fact you are speaking impopular
Rhymes are moved and you cant be stop wit the
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose
Thats a bad habit stepping out on stage one
Drop the mic come and turn to page one
Look at the master my rank is higher
My lyrical burns your brains on fire

7848,"Mr Nigga Lyrics
Say ho everybody say ho
By the way yo
I said take it slow like way back in the dayyo
By the way yo everybody say ho
Everybody say hooooo hooo
Everybody say ho
And check it out now
Who is the cat eating out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be riding up in the highrise elevator
Other tenants who be prayin that he aint the new neighbor
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
They try to play him like a chump cause he got what they want
He under thirty years old but already hes a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
VIP at the club backstage at the show
Yes yall the best crib the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze say word 
Checks with Os ooooohs
Straight all across the globe watch got three timezones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants two bank accounts two homes
One problem even with the Os on his check
The popo stop him and show no respect
Is there a problem officer Damn straight its called race
That motivate the jake woowoo to give chase
Say they want you successful but that aint the case
You living large your skin is dark they flash a light in your face
Now who is cat dining out on the town
Maitred wanna take a whole year to sit him down
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now who is the cat at Armani buying wears
With the tourists who be asking him do you work here
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga


Yo the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def
White folks gotta mumble the chorus beneath they breath
I didnt say it 
But theyll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar while this song is in they car
And even if theyve never said it lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like late night Im on a first class flight
The only brother in sight the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat 2C
She approach officially talking about Excuse me
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she dont believe that Im in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she come by walkin past
I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph
Wowwww Mr Nigga I love you I have all your albums 
They stay on nigga patrol on American roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane go where they please
But I go over seas and I get overseized
London Heathrow me and my people
They think that illegals a synonym for negro
Far away places customs agents flagrant
They think the dark faces smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalyis followed by Xrays
Interrogated and detained til damn near the next day
No evidence no apology and no regard
Even for the big American rap star
For us especially us most especially
A Mr Nigga VIP jail cell just for me
If I knew you were coming Id have baked a cake 
Just got some shoepolish painted my face
They say they want you successful but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace they start changing up the tempo
Now who is cat riding out on the town
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride pat him down
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill
They gotta send it to the lab to make sure the shit is real
Mr Nigga Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga Nigga
You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna
Woody Allen molested and married his stepdaughter
Same press kicking dirt on Michaels name
Show Woody and SoonYi at the playoff game Holding hands 
Sit back and just bug think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black
OJ found innocent by jury of his peers
And they been fucking with that nigga for the last five years
Is it fair is it equal is it just is it right
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white
If white boys doing it well its success
When I start doing well its suspect
Dont hate me my folks is poor I just got money
Americas five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up yo straight up
Its new yall livin off of slave traders paper
But Im a live though yo Im a live though
Im puttin up the big swing for my kids yo
Got my mom the fat waterfront crib yo

6131,"Yeah the universe let the planets align
Spent 10k and the card didnt decline
Bartender one Casamigos and lime
Im celebrating gracefully getting better with time
I aint even halfway through this incredible ride
But like Im kind of doing an incredible job
When I was eighteen living beyond my means
I was afraid of my dreams looking at the finer things
Wishing I could l flip to a microchip from a paper clip
Upgrade to a spaceship from a basic whip
Cash rules everything I just wanted a taste of it
Fast food hurrying saving time not wasting it
Selfsaboteur speaking it to my paramour
Torch rappers like Im igniting the aerosol
Maintaining the wherewithal that embarrass yall
Gamechanger the way I shredded your cabbage off
Explaining is changing apples to applesauce
When we were young innocence was ours but that was lost
Where I reside is the dark side of the glory
The fury I manipulate is the arc of the story
Written without a ghostwriter to author it for me
This is crime and punishment Im the judge and the jury
Listen Dostoyevsky
I swam with crocs fished with sharks
May never pop charts but I know Im popular
I was built to run the game I came up playing guard
With young niggas between 55 and 6 foot 4
I banked over both tryna bank over some more
And ball out in something gorgeous thatll keep me in court
Where theyll judge like yall does yall dont know me enough
Yall still owe us for what all yall did to the Cold Crush
To my donuts Im shooting J Dillas and what
I wanna cop when I get loot and recoup
I had to go through hella doors so in short thats why I only want two
But I aint got Jay number I CC em the proof
Cause everything I pictured in my head has always come true
They say you need vision to see eye to eye with the Druids
Spent 25 hundred on sheep skin let it seep in
I aint turn starboy in a weekend
It took more like 7 years make a sane man drink Everclear
It aint ever clear if we ever guaranteed a year
Fruits of your labor huh you work hard to get it
Jamla stitched on the motherfucking ROC fitted
Before the big lights it had to start with the scrimmage
Know that itd come sooner or later Im Trae Young nigga
Huh Im Trae Young nigga
Uh I said Dostoyevsky meets Joe Pesci
Tired of staring at a glass half empty
Turning me from Dr Sebi to cocking semi
It got me clutching my machete from the Serengeti already
Wild Styles and Fab Five Freddy
Im a stranger in Moscow dont ask how deadly is the ummah
Patrice Lumumba Kwame Nkrumah
To the Tripoli shores from the halls of Montezuma
Stop intruder Im built on facts Im not your rumor
A malignant tumor slid through in a suede Puma
The steady heavy legendary all praise is overdue
Same cloth as the chosen few rap Noble Drew
I guarantee you know more music by the suckers
Its not a victimless crime if anybody suffers
In a system that was designed for them to try to cuff us
Well whats the use of em trying when cant nobody touch us
Unless its fabricated probably drug related
But love or hate it I will not be subjugated
When they screamin You the greatest that did it whats underrated
As if every other player who spit it was unrelated
If every mans a temple the circumstance is simple
So to be transcendental I do enhance the mental
This is elder statesmen conversation
Take a look into them books from down in the basement yeah

Im just cut from a different cloth
And they dont make this fabric no more
That money coming Im grabbin it all
Triple beam leaning still balancing raw
Still got the white Macklemore
Car seat smelling like I just ripped the packing off
Run down on me in traffic Im backin em off
Sex money and murder mastered it all
Shout out to my macs but Im Billy though
Still on that gangland shit really though
Got a couple locs that Im close with
And theyll Shmurda dance on your whole shit
Free Bobby free Rowdy free the whole 9
Free Duski free Chewie free my old Ys
Act up we at your neck like bowties
Belly shit bringing niggas gifts in a whole 9
Might send your woman crush on a road trip
That pussy stuffed with a whole brick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
Buy it by the pounds smoking by the zip
Buy em by the rounds shoot em by the clip
Everybody down everybody hit
I said everybody down everybody hit
Nowadays the game full of lames and straight gays
Niggas throwing shade and hate from a fake page
Niggas catfishing for asswhippings
Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death blood on this Raf Simons
Fiends like Santana where you at with it
Back like cooked crack yall done gave too many bad fixes
Looking at my Rollie its bout that time yo
Extended clip have your whip jumping like pot holes
Yeah Im the main event you the side show
Times up mine go hit em with the Young MA flow 
I think these niggas think I lost my mojo
No I think its time I let these niggas know so
They cant fuck with me and they know so
Im out here rocking Gucci like its Polo
Stil drippin sauce thats that Mojo
They know I got that spice that Adobo
And Im still selling coke tho
Let me stop you niggas cops Robo
My nigga Black an animal stay on go mode
Bounce keep the tre cinco ocho
Chewie coming home they like oh no
Cause they know how he playing with that 45
Aint talkin weed when I tell my niggas blow smoke
Aint talkin rain when I say youll get your clothes soaked
Watch my name when you rap might get your throat choke
Might tell your bitch to come over get these slow pokes
She gon get each and every one of her holes poked
Lil Yachty in that pussy I got that row boat
Yeah back on the heels again
Born to lose build to win
Yall niggas know now

5507,"And natures game once more begins
Here we go like yes yes yall
To the beat yall
Aint no sleep yall
To the break of dawn
Five oclock in the morning
We keep rockin on
The workin people runnin like the stop clock is on
We got it poppin in the meat market
Chicks take a seat park it
By the bar so they can meet the vic with deep pockets
And them dudes buy them cars and turn em in to sweet objects of desire
Big rims and them tires
We finna drop it like its heavy as hell
The Clan of the Cavebear
Used to use the club to hit and drag her by the hair
Still use the club to get her a martini or a beer
Try to get her home and put the smell of sex in the air
Come through like the Cable Guy
Get er done
That ole hit n run
Turn em into bitter ones
Tonight is catch me if you can
You can taste the ginger bread
Aint nothin like wakin up with a stranger in your bed nope
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Putting on some Airs
King For a Day
Hard to face your fears we wear the mask like Cory McKay
You have a ball today
Its all a masquerade
Shorty paint her face like a clown but cant take away the frown
Found under the makeup
I asked her whats your passion
Answered whats the paper
She sleepin and they dont want her to wake up
Maybe then shell realize her own beauty
Baby you a star and not just a star on some dudes home movies
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like
Where am I whats your name
Gotta go Im glad you came
But tonight you will be so fun
Maybe youre the one
Soon the new day breaks the dawn


Steppin out I got my best outfit on
Gotta get it in
Im slippin in the darkness like most of the day is gone
We up all night I wonder if can hang
We used to hang from a tree now we hang behind the rope we VIP
We do it BIG
Aint no need to see ID
The entire scenery shrouded in mystery
Clouded with greenery
Six girls to every three dudes
So you have half a chance if you ask to have a dance
The ones ready to freak off dont need no romance
They belong to the sisterhood of the traveling pants
They got them hungry eyes you know sensual trance
At a glance the alcohol got you sexually advanced
The truth is so boring you gotta pretend a little
The antidote is more colorful the rainbow that end in Skittles
And the quest to trap the cat
The game is your Tender Vittles to get the bruce to say the skys fallin
Like you Chicken Little come on
Soon the new day breaks the dawn
Tomorrow Ill be like

6925,"Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Realizing that theres no place else to go
And theres nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
Cause everybody else is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I cant see because the worlds on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect cause Im morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing Im alive when Im still dead
Limited to earth unable to find out my worth
Cause I cant see past my own vanity
If Im not included then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be insanity
Oh wretched man that I am who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor that Ive only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see its me in the way
What a paradox having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending that Im actually defending
God through my facade dont need material
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him
We judge and condemn just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating were in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cause he doesnt understand
Bringing up those things we dont want to discuss
Why still do evil we dont know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light
Led to believe because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us whats going on will be alright
Oh so repressed so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride Im hiding is whats stopping me
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine ye are the branches he that lives in me
And I in him the same bring forth much fruit
Without me you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem youre traditions have deceived you
Ive chosen you you havent chosen me
Do whatsoever you asking my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name
Teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die Oh Jerusalem please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
Its not the talkers but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive
Oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping thee from perfection
Oh Jerusalem

635,"Candy says Ive come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world
Candy says Id like to know completely
What others so discreetly talk about
Im going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
Im going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when Im older
What do you think Id see
If I could walk away from me

3862,"Ima warn ya
In your circle dont mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
I plead the fifth Hell no and No your honor
So the streets honor me humble believe Im on it
I grab my momma Im headed to a different genre
They couldnt understand me now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy crack greed homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight nothing recent
But Ima call the state for back pay they owe me grievance
And you cant knock that block the block with the top that
Open up that Fanta I got that
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on
Lowlifes with no knives niggas is cutting throats
For that white like Tommy and green paper with the ghosts
Thats power I play my post one day
Youre the best thing since sliced bread the next day youre toast
I can never be toast hell no
I get money in lump sums yea I like my bread by the loaf
I like head by the coast as I stare at the pacific
She asked if I liked it Keep going girl youre terrific
Yeah baby see Im Clyde and Im looking for a Bonnie mami
To get a Gucci ghost watch rings from Avianne
I share my wealth humble beginnings hunger strangled us
Pops had a choice me or drugs he chose angel dust damn 
And the mother some was living more dangerous
Tax season the only time they was claiming us
Picture it like Kodak this bracelet you could hold that
If Im needed know that you can
Lean on me when youre not strong
Ill be your friend Ill help you carry on
For It wont be long til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on

4610,"Around my way
Around my way
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way
People let me paint a picture
You know I aint a Christian
I aint a Muslim aint a Jew
Im losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I aint knocking you but I dont fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what Im a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
Im on the block Im tracing your footsteps I keep the faith in you
Your love plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through my songs is psalms Im spiritual when Im lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin gypsy cabs and chasin 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags wrapping them around our heads
When niggas aint become American till 911
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend
These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
LA to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four cock it back
Drop the flow rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
Youll finish school but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way

4579,"Its my life 
Yeah the only one that Ill ever know
Feeling extra low
Please let me go
Oh Lord no
Its my life 
Yeah the only that Ill ever know
And it stressed me so
Oh God bless me soul
Oh Lord
Whether its the projects or a trailer park mess
Raggedy the apartment complex
With a stressed out single mom sitting on the steps
Waiting on the mailman looking for a check
Boys on the corner pushing out the chest
Questing for anything that resembles respect
Young girls swinging their hair with every step
Looking for affection settling for sex
Bodies decorated with tattoos and chains
Trying to put armor between you and pain
Wood grain steering wheel the bass bang
But not enough to drown out the hatred in your brain
The only out is smoking out
Get lean get wet get meth get tore down
Cause who the hell would want to stick around
Put me in a haze I aint never coming out
They just wanna get you in the system stick you into prison
List you in the military ship you to the desert
Gigs dont exist for you to make a decent living
But we got three illegal wars that you can pick from
Keep stressing morals and personal decisions
Tell me whats moral about these conditions
Who decided you dont got enough to teach children
State spending billions on stadiums and prisons
How many routes can folks really choose
When youre oppressed only three lead to you
First one is follow the rules and stay in school
Be the square dude that society approves
Get a little job or a shitty appartment
Subprime mortgage in a failing house market
The after your life dedication and hardship
You died just as poor as you was when you started
Fuck that whats up with the second option
You could always hit the corner and try to get it popping
Get fast guap when youre out dropping and clocking
But chances are that youll probably die violent
The best hope that you got is getting locked
And end up with a job in a prison metal shop
They aint paying nothing but three hots and a cot shit
Dont you know thats the biggest hustle they got
Or door three you can get on that welfare
But they aint trying to help theyll put you in hell there
Give you just enough so youre not gonna starve
And constantly harass you while youre looking for a job
Do luck up and someone that got you to punch a clock
And they found about it and your check is getting docked
Cant win for losing dehumanizing
Youll never get caught up you caught up in a cycle

Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
If you a faker stop hallucinating
Stop procrastinating we dont run with traitors
We so real were so bout it bout it pimping
Aint no cash flowing unless its strictly stricken
Aint no weed blowing unless youre going half
Aint no liquor pouring until you pay your tab
Aint no bitches bending over backwards 
Steady pouring something that I lack 
And stack up with money were loaded to death 
These niggas thats bummy they hate me to death 
But none of these niggas will step on the scene
And go oneonone they value their health
They know Ill slap a ho straight to the moon
Like I was an animal sadistic goon
Your life is in danger when niggas assume
When you fuck around with my money thats doom 
Power to people that hustle like me
247 they grind these streets
Shine like gemstones when I creep
Ooh blind mine enemies
I dont know the definition of sleep
If I couldnt starve I wouldnt eat 
So my main focus is my cheese
And slap any ho that dont heed ugh

First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michelle
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming thats why I went solo
And kept on stompin
While yall motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now Im making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes Who you foolin
Yall niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boys on your team so youre losing
Ayy yo Dre stick to producing
Calling me Arnold but you been a dick
EazyE saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But Im a man and aint nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkkas Most
You could yell all day but you dont come close
Cause you know Im the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles but you still got one to go
With the LENCH MOB
And yall disgrace the CPT
Cause youre getting fucked out your green
By a white boy with no Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Now youre getting done without Vaseline
Damn it feels good to see people on it
The bigger the cap the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punkass villain
Youre getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Rens shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho so
I couldnt stop you from getting ganked
Now lets play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube it wasnt worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair Nah cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gangbanged by your manager fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and highheels
So dont believe what Ren say
Cause hes going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you Toby
Used to be my homie now you act like you dont know me
Its a case of divide and conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton but you moved to Riverside
So dont front MC Ren
Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It aint my fault one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline
Now youre getting done get getting done
Now youre getting done get getting done
Now youre getting done without Va Va Va Va Vaseline
I never have dinner with the president

And when I see your ass again Ill be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch fucking your homeboys you little maggot
EazyE turned faggot
With your manager fella
Fucking MC Ren Dr Dre and Yella
But if they were smart as me
EazyE would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light em up burn em up flame on
Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga what you thinking bout
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
Cause you cant be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams

But Im street Catch the beat

Dont you dare step off the topic

The whole three four five six seven eight nine
In the pocket burstin in the air are rockets
Creatin lots of Lyte get it
How many different ways can I say it
Piano Man how many ways can you play it
I spell it out the LYTE
Without a doubt Got to be funky
And it damn sho nuff is
It gotta be like that in this rough biz
Of music baby use it or lose it
Whats funky is funky you cant refuse it
I got a grip on the groove and it wont move
An inch until I pinch this party
Can you dig it	Right on	Right on 4X 
Its my style love it or lump it
Its my beat pass it or pump it
And it thumps like a heartbeat
And when it gets old it wont get weak
Itll get stronger much stronger
Long live the King but the Lyte lives longer
Its well argumented and well documented
I hold the title of the best you cant prevent it
With a ten foot pole you cant hold em
Born to be wild is what a song once told me
Was my destiny so I strive to be the best
Lo and behold
Every rhyme I write you gots to chant them
Every song I sing a national anthem
Is there a message in my music
If I can do it you can do it
Can you dig it	Right on	Right on 8X 
The L Y T E has to make
funky funky funky hit records Constantly
So in the advent of an event
I have to invent a dope style comment
I come off with flyin colors
I keep my own identity compared to no others
Its hard to do but I pull it through
Cause Im Lyte the MC thats what I do
The body snatcher yo I gots to catch a
MC head up bring on a batch of
New ones so I can systematically do em

If you calling it dead youre adding onto the death

Grab a pen and pad and show them all how too flow

Resurgence of lyricism aint current apparent the yearning the colorful ways of busting
No other could ever enter the zone

Ive been cleaning out my nest and I found an old book of my poetry
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid by rappin to the nation
But thats not likely so heres my application
Pass it to the man at ATT
Cause when I was in school I got the AEE
But theres no SC for this youngsta
I didnt have no money so now I gotta punch the
Clock gotta slave and be half a man
But whitey says theres no room for the African
Always knew that I would clock Gs
But welcome to McDonalds May I take your order please
Gotta serve ya food that might give you cancer
Cause my son doesnt take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers bottles and Similac
Do I have to sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back
Or should I just wait for help from Bush
Or Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douche
A Massengill what the hell
Crack will sell in the neighborhood
To the corner house bitches
Miss Parker little Joe and Todd Bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I copped me a bird better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po
To a nigga that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause I couldnt follow the plan of the presidency
I never get love again
But blacks are too fuckin broke to be Republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Til I stopped fillin out my W2
Now senators are gettin high
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry this is our only room to walk
Cause we dont want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than a Bush
Tell the politicians the hustlers
Live and let live Yeah 
Tell the politicians the hustlers

5708,"Dear Black Son theres people youve never met
Who fear and hate you for something that you never did
And these people are so selfconvinced
Sometimes they pull the trigger call that selfdefense
And in that sad insanity
Their fear is realer to them than your humanity
But thats their problem its not yours
Listen to your pop for a second
These are the confessions of a father broken hearted
Who dont know how to pull his only son out of a target
They lied when they said it was the bottom where you started
You were a king long before them ships departed
You are not defined by anybody elses crimes
You dont need to answer for what happens in their minds
You are not confined by their imaginary lines
You dont need permission to exist with the divine
In fact you dont need permission from no one including me
You need not do anything but be just breathe
Whatever you dream let it mean youre free
Tears on your cheek never made nobody weak
Sometimes we got to grieve let it burn let it bleed
Then let yourself heal pray to God that it will
Youve got a spirit that a bullet cant kill
That doesnt make it any less real
They say it takes a man to raise a man
Youre slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man whos slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Dear Black Son
Dear Black Son I cant protect you like I want to
I never judge you all I can do is love you
And thats all anyone can ever do is love you
All I can do is wonder how can anyone not love you
They recognize divine in you
So they try to find themselves by defining you
Theyre living in a myth that they dont want to lose
And now theyre too terrified to face your kind of truth
But every single time you shine its proof that they mightve threw a chain around your body never conquered you
They dont always honor you but they love your culture
Let me show you how to move when the laws approach you
Its best to keep your hands where they can see them
And try to understand that youre not even what theyre peeping
They dont see a sweet kid that loves his little sister
Their mind is seeing five hundred years of pictures
In fact they dont visualize a kid
They see grown man imagery mythic masculinity
But you are not their fetishes or fears
Nor my ambition and tears nothing can interfere
Weve got to trust our seeds once we sow them
We hold them when theyre growing
But we never really own them
We love up on them play with em pray for them
And cling very closely to them moments
They say it takes a man to raise a man
Youre slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man whos slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And her I stand tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last

Its like Im in the dirt diggin up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
All it takes is one song on the radio youre
Right back on it reminding me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But Im coming for closure
Dont suppose an explanation Im owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh you thought it was over
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
Well Ive never recovered
But tonight bet you that what youre
Bout to go throughs tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges Mind saying Let it go fuck this
Hearts saying I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad
And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
Thought some time would pass and Id forget it Forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
May be gone but hes not forgotten
And dont think cause hes been out the picture so long that Ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya
Youre wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold
Have you any idea the shit that Ive gone through
Feelings I harbor All this pentup resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how Im doing
Letters you dont respond to em
Fuck it Im coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on ya
Poof then Im gone voosh
I flee the scene The scene like it was my last ride
You see right through Right through 
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth The truth 
But its easier to justify whats bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
I just hate to be the bad guy The bad guy 
Follow me Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
I just hate to be the bad guy
Follow me I ruhuhun follow me I ruhuhun
Ive been drivin around your side of this town
Like nine frickin hours and fortyfive minutes now
Finally I found your new address park in your drive
Feel like Ive been waitin on this moment all of my life
And its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and Im duckin on the side of your house
See its sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya but I aint here for your empathy
I dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
Its revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potentialI peeked Haha 
Continue to peep still bent low then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
All the way round to the back porch
Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
You dont plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue
Gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Ironys spectacular huh Now whos a faggot you punk
And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
Its just me you and the music now Slim I hope you hear it
Were in a car right nowwait here comes my favorite lyric
Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
Hows this for a publicity stunt This should be fun
Last album now cause after this youll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M Matthew Mitchell
Bitch I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since youre in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits time is quite near
Hope we dont get stopped no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
As cops appear in my drivers side mirror
Oh God Police Agh 
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
New plan Stan
Slim Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car
Well gotta go almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro its for you Slim this is for him
And Frank Ocean oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
Im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
Im your karma closin in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope its hopeless Im that denial that youre hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
Backs to the wall Im stackin up all them odds
Toilets clogged yeah cause Im talkin a lot of shit but Im backin it all up
But in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
Im the ringing in your ears
Im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
Im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
Grab for some water
But Im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
Im the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya
Every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rappers persona
Is half a facade and Matthew and Stans just symbolic
Of you not knowin what you had til its gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
Im the hindsight to say I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you dont stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
When its time to walk away Im every guilt trip
The baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
If theres anything you have left to say
Less it makes an impact then dont bother
So fore you rest your case better make sure youre packing a wallop A wallop 
So one last time Im back
Fore it fades into black and its all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh as we pick up where the last Mathers left off

7443,"Aint it funny the things we do to get paid
The shit we do to show niggas that we aint afraid
Yeah I got my education on the streets
Doin dirt left a nigga with some muddy feet
Everyday life brings everyday drama
Smokin weed only makes a nigga mind wander
So much I couldve done but I didnt do
A lot of shit a nigga never shouldve went through
Trustin another soul with my fate
Showed me how easily love can turn to pure hate
The road I know I came to a fork in it
Good or bad Im a still be the nigga winnin NOW
But tomorrow aint guaranteed
Maybe I can see the future through my young seeds
Plant it and hope the planet dont damage them
Its a thin line but Ima get mine
Who can you trust God only knows
Its hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
Who can you trust God only knows

Money thats all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
So much pain drownin my brain I need a paper towel
Wrap it round soak up the strain I feel safer now
Lookin down the road Ive travelledits been a bumpy one
The walls that I stood on was Humpty Dumpty ones
I feel like one of them pieces up in a chess game
On the line defending yours from mine
Im makin moves attached to strings you cant see
If the move seems a little bit awkward it aint me
Now fony people ride your nuts for dolla signs
I bet you drop some cash on the ground theyd holla MINE
You far behind man Im way too ahead I might be gone
Think you had some killers ridin with you youre home alone
Im in the zone meaning space age pimpin new millenium
Holes down deep in the wall I cant get into them
Im friend to them real ass niggas and family members

The root of all evil they say
But yet theres so much evil in all our roots
Born in a world of iniquity some knowing some not knowing Even so weve accomplished so much
But still we have so far to go Cmon man
Were born hustlers and together well be greater later
Used to die for freedom respect
Now were dying for dope hoes and paper
Im guilty of all that shit and more
Questioning life asking what am I here for
To some that might seem strange but you dig this
Dont get your feelings hurt personal and business
Make em average to acheive pimp trick status
Lame niggas with no nuts end up embarrassed
Compromise and commercialize in the eyes of your niggas
Selling out to get the prize
At the same time my baby cries
Im on a cell phone in another state doing sound checks
Tryin to make my little niggas lives a little better
Than a bulletproof sweater nigga love hurts
Ive been a veteran in this game
I aint trying to be better than
Only as equal as the better man
You can only imagine the ghetto if you aint raised in it
Thats where Im from childhood glory days in it
I wade in it what The waters
Take me on down the stream Im going farther
Its still from coast to coast shore to shore
I stand accused of being a pimp from root to floor
Doin work constantly thinkin bout your family
As soon as you think its time to chill
God damn it be time for another project another dealine

7291,"Hypocrites hookers sex offenders
Yall niggas wanna be pimps and players
This aint 1997 nigga
Id rather be rich and unhappy than broke and miserable
Cause the game dont give a FUCK if you lyrical
And thats pitiful so my position is pivotal
You can hate me all you like but you worship the principle
I inspire revolution the governments not invincible
Vietnam to Venezuela trick knowledge they pimpin you
All up in the hood like McDonalds and liquor
Selling AIDS medicine when we know you got the cure nigga woo 
You leery of conspiracy theory but hear me
From a business perspective it makes more sense clearly
Cause moreover thats what we go to war over
And numbers dont lie unless we do Bush and Gore over
Free markets make money disingenuously
But I invest in agriculture biochemistry
Smart nigga from the hood pussy what type of crime is that
But execs are like You from Harlem Where your diamonds at
Stupid
Cant dodge the game
If you lookin for the money or the fame ohohh 
The players and the rules aint changed oh no 
But see we tryin to leave a name
So were turnin out
Yeah this is how pimps get pimped and players get played
Rich people get robbed and broke niggas paid
New York London Chicago Philly and LA
Miami DC Bmore and out in the Bay
Were tearin it out of the frame
See we deserve to stake that claim
If we didnt its a cryin shame
What were concerned about is how to turn it out
Show me a pretty girl with the world stuck to her
And I bet you theres a brother thats tired of fuckin her
Lots of niggas girls is someone elses one night stand
I probably made some bitches nervous listenin with they man ha ha 
And if that offends somebody Im sorry fuck you
What you think revolutionaries dont like to fuck too
You just gotta beware of dangerous coochie
Cover ya head like a kufi some rappers think that they live in a movie
Until they get herpes or clap from a groupie
And I dont need to shout you out nigga you know who you be
Look most people are only players cause they got played
And have not let go of that shit since the 7th grade
Yeah you got your heart broke life sucks doesnt it
But you shouldnt fuck up someone elses life because of it
Someone did your mother like that thats why you fatherless
Before jail or racist cops thats what the problem is
See whos the one to place that blame
We getting trapped in cycle of pain
With a generation headed down the drain
Thats how were turning out
This is how pimps get pimped
And players get played
Beautiful women get cheated on
And gangsters strayed
Jersey Detroit Denver Phoenix Atlanta
Texas Vegas Seattle and fuckin Louisiana
Regardless of the money youre paid
You spend it on a watch and a chain
But cant offer your children a thing
What the hell is goin on in your brain
Yeah Im not a crack rapper Im not a backpacker ha ha ha 
Im not a wack rapper moonlighting as a bad actor
I treat labels like the projects cause Im a hater what 
Go to the Sony building and piss in the elevator
Cater to hustlers crooks and cheap smugglers
Bootleg my own album to reach customers yeah 
Every city state and country the hood love me
Even Aborigines in Australia bump me
They say underground fans are all the color of talcum
But who the fuck you think buy 50 and Jay albums
Who the fuck you think made Snoop and Dre platinum
Call up any major record label and ask em
But theres some devils in disguise in hiphop
That belong at Republican fundraisers with Kid Rock bitch 
I hope one of my fans has one of your kids shot bitch 
And blames it on Acid Prozac and Slipknot
You a pussy actin hard like a bitch cop
Ill drop you to the floor like a reverse wristlock
Eat your food and shit on you like a highway pit stop
And make revolutionaries out of kids that used to flip rocks
The government pimped 911 to go to Iraq
And history repeats itself right on track how 
First as a tragedy and then the comedy begins why 
Cause its funny motherfuckers dont see it come around again
Where can we be free FUCK we gon be free man 
We only wanna live our lives
Live our lives with our eyes open

5807,"Some of em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of em lie about the guns they pop
But I dont I dont I dont I dont
Thats how it is for me cause I live a boss life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I dont I dont I dont I dont
Thats how it is for me cause I live a boss life
Now this is for the Bs and the Cs and the Ds and the Hs
And the Gs puttin work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it if my nigga detoxing its more for me
Baby this is presidential really a pocket full of women
Understanding how Im living show them hoes how you winning
Its the beginning with the pearls youre given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say its Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes then the clothes Imma have to let em go
You know how the Dogg roll dont get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite mixed with somethin pimpish
And its comin from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen all that shit is in my past
Im connected to the purse first nigga the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and Im strong to the finish
See me man Im nothin like you
I got the kinda swagger that you aint used to
Im leanin in my ride fo fifth cock bangin
Me Im ridin by ya on the corner block slangin
Im livin that boss life
The hoes come runnin when they see me comin
Im livin that boss life
You can have anything just dont fuck with my money
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khakis and them Timbs and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin aint the route thats even if you got it
Theres a method to you holdin it when they cant do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she bout it
You can have her and her partner fuckin with it for a dolla
If she a baller she gon ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow then she gon swallow
All the game you got to give her be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin out the Doggfather
less I knew that she was bout him havin diamonds on his collar
Im just an author spreading game to my partners
Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor


See me man Im nothin like you
I got the kinda swagger that you aint used to

Man fuck that shit man
You need to take your ass to school get you a motherfuckin job and shit
Man fuck that man fuck you man look here
When I get fourteen man I wanna buy me a rag top tray on some gold with a threewheel motion
Chin wheel pull out Ah shit three finger ring fat ass link Stanley and a big booty go bitch to with it
Man fuck all that
Break em off something
Aha its really sad
Young brothers and sisters today have a lack of understanding on
What it really means to be Black
Could you tell me who unleashed our animal instinct Uh 
And the white man sittin there tickled pink No shit 
Laughin at us on the avenue
Bustin caps at each other after havin brew
We cant enjoy ourselves
Too busy jealous at each others wealth Right right 
But comin ups just in me
But the Black community is full of envy Oh shit 
Too much backstabbin
While I look out the window I see all the Japs grabbin
Every vacant lot in my neighborhood Yup 
Build a store and sell their goods
To the county recips
You know us po niggas nappy hair and big lips Thats right 
Four or five babies on your crotch
And you expect Uncle Sam to help us out Shit 
We aint nothin but porch monkeys to the average bigot redneck honky
You say comin up is a must
But before we can come up take a look at us
You dumb ass nigga
Break em off something
And all yall dopedealers
Youre as bad as the police cause ya kill us
You got rich when you started slangin dope
But you aint built us a supermarket So shit 
So when can spend our money with the Blacks
Too busy buyin gold and Cadillacs Huh 
Thats what ya doin with the money that ya raisin
Exploitin us like the Caucasians did Yup 
For 400 years I got 400 tears for 400 peers
Died last year from gangrelated crimes
Thats why I got gangrelated rhymes Right 
But when I do a show to kick some facts
Us Blacks dont know how to act
Sometimes I believe the hype man
We mess it up ourselves and blame the white man
But dont point the finger you jiggaboo
Take a look at yourself ya dumb nigga you
Pretty soon Hip Hop wont be so nice
No Ice Cube just Vanilla Ice Man fuck that 
And youll sit and scream and cuss
But theres no one to blame but us
Yeah but why is it that one motherfucker can ruin it for twentytwo thousand motherfuckers
When they wanna come see a good jam you know what Im sayin
Ayy Cube tell em something shit you know how I feel
Break em off something
Us well always sing the blues
Cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
And if ya step on mine ya pushed a button
Cause Ill beat you down like it aint nothin
Just like a beast
But Im the first nigga to holler out peace black man
I beat my wife and children to a pulp
When I get drunk and smoke dope
Got a bad heart condition
Still eat hogmogs and chitlins
Bet my money on the dice or the horses
Jobless so Im a ho for the armed forces
Go to church but they tease us
With a picture of a blueeyed Jesus
They used to call me Negro
After all this time Im still bustin up the chiffarobe
No respect and ignored
And Im havin more babies than I really can afford
In jail cause I cant pay the mother
Held back in life because of my color
Now this is just a little summary
Of us but yall think its dumb of me
To hold a mirror to ya face but trust
Nobody gives a fuck about

7037,"What you want you aint gon get it
What you need you wont admit it
It really dont matter how hard you try
Cause money cant buy respect
The material mind is enticed by the dollar bill
It makes some brothers fight and some would even kill
Some will do anything for a bill
Cause they think theyll get respect
Bought a big Mercedes and you got about ten more cars
Now you impress the ladies and youre a neighborhood star
Gold on your fingers and your neck
But you still get no respect
Your mind is weak so when you speak
Youre obsolete your mental peak
Is in the street your mouths a beak
Big like a bird and your futures bleak
Now you should seek some help decree
Youre sellin crack and livin cheap
Bought a brandnew ride to go beepbeep
Playin music outside loud in your jeep
But you should know unless youre slow
There comes an end to the sidewalk show
And up the rivers where youll go
Wearin stripes from head to toe
No fancy gold no fancy car
And the brothers inside dont care who you are
A 7foot brother doin life
300 pounds says youre his wife
Walks in your cell and says Fix it up
Then you look up and say Not the butt
He says Shut up But but No but
Now what you gonna do freakydeaky or what
The money was good the money was fast
No business mind and the money wont last
In the money rate you fell first to last
Now every night you fight for your ass
They say what goes up must come down
All hustlers know that sound
Cause youre here today gone the next
And youll find out the hard way you get no respect
Man you must be crazy and bugged
Whatcha mean I dont get no respect
You crazy
You got to respect me
Cause I was the first millionaire off the streets boy
Aint nobody ever had a hustle like mine
In 72 I was killin em boy
Man go head go head
Im tellin ya I was shittin on it
Word up I was the man
And a car these niggas aint got no cars today man
My car was so pretty I ride by niggas dicks get hard
You dig what Im sayin
Haha man get outta here go head
Caddy boy Grand Daddy Caddy
They used to call me Mackaroni Tony boy
Aw man go head shut yo broke ass up man
Word I spell it out Ill yell it out
For those brothers that keep sellin out
Cause local clout is all youre about
A few bullshit bitches and hanging out
And every days like a title bout
When the next man wants you taken out
Id like to know what youre thinkin about
It sure aint dyin without a doubt
But you better wake up before its too late
Or theyll be doing your makeup down at the coroners place
And you will have lived just to die
And youll die with no respect
Yo man what about hoes what about hoes
Hoes
Shit man I had mo bitches than muthafuckin Coned got switches boy
I had hoes loads of hoes you know what Im sayin
Hoes hoes you dig
Youre just talkin shit
I had all the money man I was the man

5591,"I was told not long ago
Too hort dont stop that rap
Now every time I grab the mic
I rock it just like that
8 years ago when I started my rap
I used to sell tapes everywhere
It was me and my homeboy Freddy B yall
Kickin it like big players
Everybody loved my raps like hundred dollar bills
I rocked house parties on 98th
Even rocked in the 69 ville
Might find me on the mic at Hot Lips house
Or at the East Bay Dragons Spot
All the 85 boys with their hands in the air
Screaming Too hort just dont stop
Like Arroyo Park like Plymouth Rock
Birch Street and Sunnyside
Like Sobrante Park and Brookfield
East Oakland yeah thats right
5 years ago I continued to rock
And if you havent yet heard my name
It was all in the papers on the evening news
I was stone cold in the game
Around that time a friend of mine my homeboy Lionel B
Hooked me up like this yall on the stage just rockin the beat
Some say I have a dirty mind
Sometimes that might be true
But these are just some dirty times
I aint trippin on you
I aint trippin keep on talkin
You think Im smokin that pipe
I got money homeboy
I even got some of your future wifes
Well my story goes like this man
I smooth went out on wax
Singin Girl Thats Your Life
Female Funk and Shortrapp
Silky D worked the beat kicked me down cold cash
I was ridin the bus one day
Next day I was on the gas
Everybody loved Too hort
Rollin down the strip
Then one day just like that
Homeboy jumped on my tip
You started spreadin rumors man
And said you saw me rappin in jail
No I never came down to the flat lands
I was chillin with the homies on the hill
I aint trippin but the word went out
Sir Too hort was through
Cant really say where it all began
So Im blamin it all on you
Everybody used to say Too hort dont stop that rap
Now every time you see my face
You say Im smokin crack
Oakland California I heard it all before
Im makin big bank now rockin the crowd

You know Im comin up
Cause every time you see my face

With the cleanest drop Biarritz
Everything was kickin in
Me and Ran kept cashin checks
Next thing I know there you go
Guess whos on my tip
You said I just got out of jail
Jumped right back on that pipe
Your sisters boyfriend told you man

Then you came to my show
And stood there so damn bold
You said Too hort man you smoking
And Im standin there draped in gold
I aint trippin no more
Really aint worth my time

Benzes roll Beamers jet
And Caddies keep on dippin
You keep on talkin all that crap

4521,"Aint nowhere to run to
There aint nothing here for free
If I dont like my life I gut it and rebuild it
Fuck it keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hiding in me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewed his good traits together made Ali
Filled his lungs with the Quran until he breathed
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Aint asked nobody for a mother fuckin hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger aint never look back
What he know about how the world spin
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he trying to replace it
Youll find in him a heart thats second to none
But I know also that his lessons aint done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done
Aint no where to run to
There aint nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom aint free lord
Aint no where to run to
There aint nothing here for free
Youll see what I see and know that freedom aint free
One half of all the two leggeds on the scene
Are too timid to dream cos failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take whats given
Thats your decison I just dont consider that living
If Im to die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
Im hot knife through butter in the nights sky
It shouldnt take a genius to see this hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
Cos this cold world couldnt give a fuck if Im fed
I aint curled up in my bed
If I dont set the world ablaze trust it aint cos of nothing I did
Listen I dont think Gods obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
Til the end Im a one man army friend

7655,"Back in the days was kinda crazy kid I started out with nothin
Wasnt livin like Thanksgiving I was turkey without the stuffin
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the po house
Say mama caught the drama she would bleed tryin to feed fo mouths
Wasnt rockin Girbauds I barely had clothes and when it snow
And temperatures droppin below zero you know I froze
No CDs a black and white TV I see thats about to retire
With a hanger for the antenna turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin in my cabinet but cans of Raid
Im knockin on my neighbors door to borrow a cup of sugar for my KoolAid
I wasnt freshly dipped my gear was straight ripped
Im trippin cause my winter coat got lost buttons and zippers that wouldnt stay zipped
I never remembered a dinner the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black I had KitKats on top of Cracker Jacks
Walkin the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldnt speak I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin humped from the stunts I always struck out
The one you like says take a hike if you cant pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby Im blowin up in the world
Blowin up blowin up in the world

With a GED diploma with more ribs showin than Tony Romas
In order to get straight I gots to to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin down on the corner slangin fat rocks to bottles with the black tops
For cops got my shorty watchin my back hops
Makin mad lucci bought up Louis Vuitton Gucci
Hoochies callin me boochi while they smooch me givin up the coochie
Now Im a felon started sellin and splittin melons
Some started jellin and tellin police just cause I was swellin
Hangin out on the corner playin ceelo rollin for half a kilo
Yo youll never see G low or goin below
Yeah straight gettin fortunate as long as fiends was torchin it
It started gettin hot around the block the cops was scorchin it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
This business in drugs is gettin too risky
So now I just lamp collect stamps snatch tramps diamonds and pearls

And started chillin in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin no time for pains sportin gold chains and rings
Clockin money and fame nothin changed Im still the same
Just spendin twenties and tens at women pullin on my linen
Then grinnin cause I was winnin in this game from the beginnin
The lyrical skills was kinda ill gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build known for rappers run and go write wills
And turned from a hobo to a solo posing for photos
Though my dough used to be low now I puff on cigars and blow Os
So catch a flashback of a G Rap track attacked like a head crack
Get smacked through your cap with the lead black
And heres a new cut for poobutt rappers hangin from off my two nuts
Like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G Rap dont sleep money unless its with ya girl

7908,"Now its finna be some energy we got the remedy
Im in the vicinity of a nigga that can spit it with me
Feel the fire whenever we act up
Everybody else is incompatible with the artillery
So forget about it when you hear about it
Cause its too fast when I pass the baton to Busta
Hit a victim in the middle of the body with a bullet and a rhythm
Every murder is a structure
Every time I hit you niggas with another jam be blacking
I be sounding like a nigga full of anger
Now Im back to beat you in the head Ill bring another banger
With my nigga Twist everything we do be up to wanger
You dont really really wanna see the way that I come
And Ill give it to you get up on the ceiling see a nigga numb
Do it how I wanna do it till I make another nigga drop
I put my money on it homie Im the one
Go on here pick it up carry it the way you wanna carry it
Do whatever you wanna do

Woopin a niggas ass
Skibbedy boop skibbedy bop skibbedy beep

Im a menace when I bust a lyrical tec off
Go faster than Ricky Bobby kill him in Talladega Nights
Niggas try to get up when a nigga hit up
When it I come I promise you gotta pay the price
Look why dont everybody wanna come and try get a little taste
Of the shit I got let me put it all up in your face
When I spit it I got a nigga wilding all over the place
Everybody better listen here
Cause you know when I bring him I will never never stop
Make a nigga rewind and bring it back to the top
Throw the shit up in the streets and I be running every block
Everybody better stand clear
Like a millimeter when I be booking the track up
Motivated for murder whenever I act up
A couple of phenomenal niggas can stack up
Gets anybody that wanna live in the back up
Killing everybody when I bust a clip off
Cause Imma be attacking them with the insane flow
Then I be having them calling me Twista Phelps
And my nigga Buss like Usain Bolt
Shocked a nigga like I was a thousand volts

The way I gotta kill em and the way I gotta flow
You dont really wanna test me boy cause Ill pop ya

You can talk about it with a bunch of people
They all say that Im a lyrical manifestation of rhythm
Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang em
And get em and do it every single time I hit em
When I do it it just gotta be accurate
I am attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking in back and in front
Cause every time we in the place we fill it to capacity
I be coming with it he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid it gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey the prodigy and Imma be the one to prove it
Dont you ever forget it the way we coming
And they sending somebody gonna probably be needing a medic
So give us the credit in alphabetical order
We coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it

Earth wind and fire sounded so heavenly
Ohio players and Curtis Mayfield
Aretha Franklins picture on a playbill
Al Green in a tight suit all white
Minnie Riperton high notes all night
Moms even had a box full of 45s
Put the needle down yea that sounds sorta live
Sound like the kind of groove I could rap over
Got drunk off the beat then I was back sober
Bring that part back yea Imma murder that
Donny Hat on the track with Roberta Flack

Cant explain that I was just borrowing it
Moms on a rampage lookin for her Parliament
And Donny Hathaway feelin like a castaway
Hiding in grandmoms room more than half the day

And nobody home now Imma be a crying kid
But its seeming like Im safe for the time being
My uncle gettin all the blame far as Im seeing

You know damn well if you touch one
And you get caught thatll be your ass

With a black and red nap sack
Came to bring the vinyl back
I put it back before anybody notices
He said close call I said yea I know this is
But I got away with it like the perfect crime
And made the fresh tape man it was worth the time
An aggravation and stress almost made a mess
Shed a found out its me she would of laid to rest
But Im over like a fat rat
That was smart its a good thing you hid em in that backpack
It feels so good to get that out the way
Now Im out the door back out to play

When he tells you that he loves you its you nobody else

7828,"Starin at the world through my rearview
Just lookin back at the world
From another level you know what I mean Starin
Multiple gunshots clear the block the fun stops
Snitches is callin cops people shot nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me then they lie to me
Product of a dyin breed all my homies tryin weed
Now the little babies crazed raised off Hennessy
Tell me will my enemies flee when they see me
Believe me even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen through intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin bad boys to grown men its on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end my friend Im seein nothin but my dreams comin true
While Im starin at the world through my rearview
See Im seein nothin but my dreams comin true
While Im starin at the world through my rearview
They got me starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Now you see him now you dont
Some niggas be here for the moment and then they gone
What happened to em
Well lets see it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast left far Im through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin until our dreams come through
Starin at the world through my rearview
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell countin days in this livin black hell
Do you feel me Keys to ignition use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section from years of chincheckin
Turn to Smith Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father Im a soldier
Im gettin hotter cause the worlds gettin colder
Baby let me hold ya talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question
Do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rearview
I said now I know the answer
Do dreams come true
Starin at the world through my rearview
They got me starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
Nigga Kadafi say
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Ninesix for Glocks
Cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets
Somethin I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that only one life to lead a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted infested since a seed
We all die breed bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns Outlawz and truants
Shits deep turn eighteen burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty or choosin my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too Im starin through your rearview
Hahahaha you aint knowin what we mean by starin through the rearview
So since you aint knowin what we mean let me break it better understandin the worldThe world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin on the game and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world aint no trick no more the world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world from high watch behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do just gotta put our mind to it and do it its all about the papers money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do what they wanna do bitch niggas do what they can
They got me starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly

Hey No flex zone hey no flex zone

Wonder when they bite me do these bitches teeth hurt
Yes I am an icon thats me on your Tshirt
Thought you knew better do your fucking research
You aint know this the no rip zone

I like bad bitches cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick magnitude

You said you would always stay
It wasnt me who changed but you
And now youve gone away
But dont you know that now youre gone
And Im left here on my own

You dont have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You dont have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me
Believe me
I cant help but love you
But believe me Ill never tie you down

6068,"It was Friday night and I was feeling aight Yup 
Downtown Atlanta big city bright lights
Mixing Henny with the Sprite while Im drinking and driving
No police lights Lights no police sirens
Im headed to the club looking for a freak Freak 
To spread a little love and spread a couple cheeks Cheeks 
Pull up to the spot 26s like BAM
Eyes on me like Bitch do you see him
Strolled through the front door headed to the VIP VIP 
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips Sips 
Scoping out the room and what do I see
A nice round butt and a pair of doubleDs
So I crept up like Shawty whats hatnin
You killing that dress and I love it with a passion
Then she turned around and her face was aight
She had a gap tooth and a mean overbite
But I was like Hmm

Im gon end up fucking you
Is that what you wanna do shawty
If I take one more drink

Cause tonight damn right I might do it again
So I called up the homies What up Lets ride

Get a couple of Coronas couple of limes Yup 
Went up to the bar and saw a couple of dimes Woo 
So I slowly walked up and said Hi

Grab the cameraphone and take a bunch of drunk pictures
Cause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah Yup 
Equals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda Haha 
And you know how far one drink could go
Start slurring my speech slowing up the flow
Hiking up your skirts climbing up your shirts

3931,"It was in ancient history four thousand BC
Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree
Hanging on a branch up under the sun
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne
Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin him jive
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive
Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jos tail
Got mad and went roarin through the jungle trail
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree
And said Put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me
An ol eagle from Asia made a non stop flight
Tryin to make it in time just to see them fight
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge
Coming all the way from India on a local barge
Ol gorilla heard em talking in the lions den
But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins
Jo Jo yelled at Leo Go on knock him down
He dont outweigh you but a thousand pounds
Leo left wailin with a left upper cut
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross
Thats when the coconut landed up against his jaw
Leo grew tired but he wouldnt give in
The elephant all loose beat his jawbone in
The buzzard said they fought furious all day
He couldnt understand how Leo got away
Jo Jo runnin everywhere spreadin the news
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos
A hoot owl reported everything he saw
Had his eyes wide open they called it a draw
Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised
Jo Jo in the trees started singin the blues
Laughin meddling jumpin up and down
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground
Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet
Jo Jo was screamin with tears in his eyes
Said Please mister Leo I apologize
Said If you let my feet upon solid ground
Ill fight you close range fifteen rounds
Leo got back and squared off to fight
Jo Jo took a leap and jumped out of sight

5695,"Sooner or later
I used to think I hated this place
Couldnt wait to tell the president straight to his face
But lately I changed nowadays I embrace it all
Beautiful ideals and amazing flaws
Got to care enough to give a testament
Bout the deeply depressing mess were in
Its home so we better make the best of it
I wanna make this country what it says it is
Still dream in the vividest living color
No matter how many times my love been smothered
Whos ever above us wont just let us suffer
All of this struggling got to amount to something
This is a letter to my countrymen
Especially those my age and younger than
Were up against an ugly trend
Everybodys hustling dont nobody touch their friends
No group singing and dancing
No anthem nobody holds hands and
Instead they give you a handheld
And make you shoulder lifes burden by your damn self
One thing that cant be debated
Power never changed on its own you got to make it
Thats why community is so sacred
Thats the symbol that we make when we raise fists
Chorus Sooner or later
We dont really like to talk about the race thing
The whole grandparents used to own slaves thing
Pat ourselves on the back in February
Looking at pictures of Abe Lincoln and the great King
But the real pictures much more embarrassing
Were still not even close to really sharing things
The situation of oppressed people
Shows what we feel it means to be a human being
What does it mean to be American
I think the struggle to be free is our inheritance
And if we say it how it really is
We know our lily skin still give us privilege
Advantage is given to the few
That are built into the roots of our biggest institutions
Thats the truth in life we got to choose
Do I fight in the movement or think Im entitled to it
This is not a practice life
This is the big game we got to attack it right
Each one of us is headed for the grave
This old crooked world wont be saved by the passive type
This is a letter to my countrymen
Not from a Democrat or a Republican
But one among ya
Thats why you call me Brother
Aint scared to tell you were in trouble cause I love you
ChorusSooner or later
They tell me Im a dreamer they ridicule
They feel defeated old bitter and cynical
Excuse me but I see it from a different view
I still believe in what a driven few could really do
I know that the masses want to sleep
And they would just rather hear me rapping to the beat
But I want to pass this planet to my son
A little better than it was when they handed it to me
So
I wrote a letter to my countrymen
Ill be happy if it only reaches one of them
Reporting live ALI your brother
Mourning in America dreaming in color
My dear Brother AliI think you know deep down in your soul that something something just aint rightYou dont want to be just well adjusted to injustice and well adapted to indifference You want to be a person with integrity who leaves a mark on the worldPeople can say when you go that you left the world just a little better than you found it I understand I want to be like that too

7319,"TranslationsFranaisDreams and Nightmares Intro Lyrics
Aint this what theyve been waitin for
You ready Uh uh
I used to pray for times like this to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some lockedup shit
In the back of the paddy wagon cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said Yeah I do
If you want it you gotta see it with a cleareyed view
Got a shorty she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed nigga please fore them triggers squeeze
Im gettin cream never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started lil nigga but Im lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless draw it like Im an artist
No crawlin went straight to walkin with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches mnagin fuckin suckin and swallowin
Anything for a dollar they tell me get em I got em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil nigga Im on fire
Icy as a hockey rink Philly nigga Im flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big cant even fit in the parking spot
You aint talkin bout my niggas then what you talkin bout
Gangstas move in silence nigga and I dont talk a lot
I dont say a word I dont say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve fuck nigga
Maybach Music
Hold up wait a minute Minute yall thought I was finished Whoa 
When I bought that Aston Martin yall thought it was rented Yeah 
Flexin on these niggas Im like Popeye on his spinach
Double M yeah thats my team Rozay the captain Im lieutenant
Im the type to count a million cash then grind like Im broke
That Lambo my new bitch she dont ride like my Ghost
Im ridin around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
Cause my mama need that bill money my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life they fuck around get killed
You fuck around you fuck around you fuck around get smoked
Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me dont fuck around no joke no
All I know is murder when it come to me
I got young niggas thats rollin I got niggas throwin Bs
I done did the DOAs I done did the KODs
Every time Im in that bitch I get to throwin 30 Gs
But now Im hangin out that drop head Im ridin down on Collins Skrrt 
They let my nigga Ern back home that young nigga be wildin Lets go 
We young niggas we mobbin Mobbin like Batman and were robbin Whoa 
This twodoor Maybach with my seat all reclinin
Im like Real nigga what up Real nigga what up
If you aint about that murder game then pussy nigga shut up
If you diss me in your raps Ill get yo pussyass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood no that tour life aint good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy I slide down on your block Block bike on 12 oclock Rah 
And they be throwin deuces on the same nigga they watch Meek Milly 
And Im the king of my city cause Im still callin them shots
And these lames talkin that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
Im the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin on me hoes waitin on me
Still on that hood shit my RollsRoyce on E
They gon remember me I say remember me
So much money have yo friends turn in yo enemies
And when theres beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40 aint no 10 a key
Hold up broke nigga turned rich Rich love the game like Mitch
And if I leave you think them pretty hoes gon still suck my dick
It was somethin bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
Im gone

3487,"The road it winds uphill all the way
Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
In God we trust cry it out loud
Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead
The burden of blood the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake
Lord above my spirit says
Death is not proud no more no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory
Wither a pain thats almost a joy
Wander there my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Stranger no wonder memories remain
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger one
Sent to do reckoning what must be done
Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty freedom maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause done faithfully
Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay
Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now embrace it my friend
Spirits cry for a god from the grave
In darkness fortune favours the brave
Dying a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal for he will live evermore
Dying a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal for he will live evermore
Think I am that Im almost there
Following now the depths of despair
Beyond the light darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all
Falling now where God cant explain
Bidding farewell a lifeline again
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the Celts

He wanders and roams through the streets and resides in an abandoned home
Panhandles for dough standin in the chow line with a stench on his clothes
And he travels in a boxcar
Used to dream about livin like a rock star
And he carries no pass
Where he jots art down to a piece time passin as his thoughts form
But he smiles as he strolls
He appreciates the sunlight shinin
The glow of the moon
Every breath that he takes is a gift
Takin in every place that he roams as anew
Wait to see where his freedom lies
Funny thing you can see freedom in his eyes
Give him shelter food clothing
And he feels like hes rich
Cause he knows its a blessing just to be alive
We are the one to enter light
Oh baby Oh baby 
Please we all dont argue this life
Oh baby Oh baby 
Hes got everything in life
Any man could want could buy
Anything in sight
He takes trips with his wife
Far away destinations
To cities that he likes
He owns buildings and property
Expensive cars
And he aint about modesty
Designer suits and the diamonds on his watches be
Shinin so bright they be blindin the eyes if you see em
But not everything you spot
Is as it seems to be
Inside theres a dark side
When he screams and he shouts
And his wife wears her shades
To hide away her dark eyes
And he hardly ever smiles
And hes so cold
Read his pupils
You would swear he has no soul
All his friends
Are the dead presidents
And hes dead like them
Cause his spirit is corroding
We are the one to enter light
Oh baby Oh baby 
Please we all dont argue this life
Oh baby Oh baby 
I guess everyone would ride in a Benz
Rather than a bucket
Anyone reside
In a crib nestled in the hill
And just to get by
In a studio apartment
And live a better live
But dont all cars get you there
And dont all shelter keep the rain from in your hair
And aint lobster and tuna both protein
And is the price of your shoe a protection fee
And aint it all just for the next man to see
And can you take it all with you when your spirit leaves
And when youre gone
Will the people all remember what you had
Rather than who you were when youre mentioned
See
We are the one to enter light
Oh baby Oh baby 
Please we all dont argue this life

",you spot Is as it seems to be Inside theres a dark side When he screams and he shouts And his wife wears her shades To hide away her dark eyes And he hardly ever smiles And hes so cold Read his pupils You would swear he has no soul All his friends Are the dead presidents And hes dead like them Cause his spirit is corroding We are the one to enter light Oh baby Oh baby Please we all dont argue this life Oh baby Oh baby I guess everyone would ride in a Benz Rather than a bucket Anyone reside In a crib nestled in the hill And just to get by In a studio apartment And live a better live But dont all cars get you there And dont all shelter keep the rain from in your hair And aint lobster and tuna both protein And is the price of your shoe a protection fee And aint it all just for the next man to see And can you take it all with you when your spirit leaves And when youre gone Will the people all remember what you had Rather than who you were when youre mentioned See We are the one to enter light Oh baby Oh baby Please we all dont argue this life Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby,Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby Oh baby He wanders and roams through the streets and resides in an abandoned home Panhandles for dough standin in the chow line with a stench on his clothes And he travels in a boxcar Used to dream about livin like a rock star And he carries no pass Where he jots art down to a piece time passin as his thoughts form But he smiles as he strolls He appreciates the sunlight shinin The glow of the moon Every breath that he takes is a gift Takin in every place that he roams as anew Wait to see where his freedom lies Funny thing you can see freedom in his eyes Give him shelter food clothing And he feels like hes rich Cause he knows its a blessing just to be alive We are the one to enter light Oh baby Oh baby Please we all dont argue this life Oh baby Oh baby Hes got everything in life Any man could want could buy Anything in sight He takes trips with his wife Far away destinations To cities that he likes He owns buildings and property Expensive cars And he aint about modesty Designer suits and the diamonds on his watches be Shinin so bright they be blindin the eyes if you see em But not everything
7058,"Here we are all alone
Who gives a fuck about what they say
Im sure Ive heard much worse
People need to worry about them first
People need to learn to mind their business instead of mine
Here we are all alone
Who gives a fuck about their dismay
But still Im facetoface
With the one person I cant replace
One person I cant just tell Im doin fine
What up Ma
Been a while
Lot of catchin up to do
Know you got a ear full
Im listenin
Momma said she loves me said she cares
Said if I need her shell always be there
But even her sayin that struck me as weird
Why did she feel those words I needed to hear
Said she understands me that was rare
Cause no one understands me not even my peers
And these just thoughts I never bother to share
So as I write my eyes start to tear
I aint tell her Im tired but still troopin
Alone but I find myself regroupin
Aint say my brain now feel like a prison
Figured Id shut the fuck up and listen
She continued that was honorable
She said I get more and more irresponsible
For normal folks she said thats a challenge
Luckily I mask mine behind talent
She said You are no longer yourself
I dont know what to expect of you
Said Im puttin up with things I normally wouldnt
She dont know why its acceptable
She said People livin in your house
Dont pay shit not respectable
I told her theyre folk I think highly of
She said Well they must think less of you
Must feel entitled all you doing
I said Ill fix it she said No you wont
Then I got defensive but still replied
I told her I need them she said No you dont
Then she said Whens the last time you spoke to your father
I said hes selfcentered why bother
Cause he only really call about his needs
And I aint got enough time to deal with his greed
Cause my days are darker
Cut from a long shank but the blade is sharper
Im makin my notsovague departure
Tell pop Im his son not his Spades partner
Last time that we spoke
He wanted to use the crib throw a party here
Which wasnt partly fair
My home need to feel like home even if I throw a party here
Then he catch an attitude
And I catch one right back at you
We adore each other but ignore each other
Think this is how the fuck I wanna act with you
Things just aint the same
But he sure will call about a Yankee game
Like Call CC and get back to me
Whats ill is he say it so casually
I love him so much he can have all the perks
Hurts so much I take all the Percs
Hurts so much but fuck it it works
Hurts so much that I cant sleep
Mom say I need to sleep more
Then again she aint on this stress level
So many people rely on me
Im tryin to get us all to the next level
Wait told her I took baby girl to the doctor
It was only for a checkup though
And she gave me the face like Now would be time
If theres anything I feel I need to let her know
But thats just Mom again just bein a mom again
Looked down at the tat on my arm again
God please give me the strength keep calm again
She asked me if Kaylin was pregnant
I looked at her like she was crazy
Cause thats my baby whats wrong with a baby
She said Nothin at all when youre not datin a baby
Beautiful girl I like everything about her thus far
I just dont wanna see you fall
Just a tad bit young so she got some growin up to do
And I replied Dont we all
Momma said Why cant you ever be alone
I said What do you mean
Went to correct her she did it herself
She said At least thats how it seems
Pop aint called hes still mad
Still pissed hes still angry
Im still goin no plan of slowin
No way Ill ever let his immaturity taint me
Momma said that Tahiry called
That aint shock me they speak a lot
Shes helpful and knowin my ex

7563,"Were living in some times thats the craziest
They say these legislators are the laziest
Dedicated religious figures have gone atheist
Each and every thing must change theres no escaping this
Im on the block postapocalyptic smoke covers
Coincidentally presented by the Koch Brothers
The magnitude of this is bigger than the both of us
The attitude is trying to manage not to choke from it
Go and get the bolt cutters open the floodgate
Any relationship Ive ever been in was lovehate
The city I was living in really never was safe
For some a temporary resolution was duct tape
Now Imma probably be on the blacklist
But I dont give a fuck so Im gonna shrug like Atlas
And if my skepticism was a brand new practice
Would yall be disappointed like yall just got catfished
Its cold blooded
Im wholeheartedly coldhearted and swole from it
The same unseen hand is still in control of it
I should be mining my own like its a gold nugget
But Im on that same bullshit just on a lower budget
Waiting on change that been low
Til the day after tomorrow I sit by the window
In a police state like your man Michael Winslow
My kinfolk told me theres a brand new Jim Crow
I been going to bed at 10 up at 5
Hustling to the bus and ride to the job
Its feeling hot as the Fourth of July
My lady just getting home we leading separate lives
She couldnt be one of those Stepford Wives if she tried
They shot my cousin he died it wasnt justified
I guess Ill see him if I make it to the other side
The corner deli owner tell me Hurry up and buy
If everybody is somebody tell me who am I
The same figure who came from Anguilla
Aint nothing different I think Im addicted to painkiller
Im unpermitted to enter the village of ShangriLa
Im depicted as being a killer thats dangerous huh
Half dozen in one hand six in the other
Yo this is more than a sun tan its living color
Black as oblivion black as obsidian
Black as the sky at midnight ante meridiem
I am black as a portrait with Diddy 2Pac and Biggie and
Black as the influence on the culture we living in
I survived the Chitlin Circuit vaudeville and then
Managed to inspire The Beatles and Bob Dyl and them
But did I miss the mark because Im just as dark
As John Henrik Clarkes inner thoughts
At the time of the Harlem Renaissance
After which rights activists
Deviated the flight path to black ratchetness
Putting us back smackdab where night catches us
We just go along for the ride passengers
Gluttons for punishment masochists
Still doing whatever master asks of us
Will this generation go down as the last of us
Where being young menwhileblack was hazardous
Enter the proverbial masked avenger
All these pretenders suffer from symptoms of Affluenza
Im just thinking aloud about extinction agendas and plans
My grandmother definitely remembers
Listen her suits were tailormade
Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways like the way she knelt and prayed
Wailing Lord master forgive us our trespasses had us real afraid
I never listened but I still obeyed
I got to see how gangstas played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then mom started chasing that base like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain
Shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings Black Thought is what that all became
My journey from a dirty hallway to the hall of fame
Music my therapeutic way to deal with all this pain
I was headed for the drain soaking before the rainwater came
And chaos thats when the order came
I started doing what Im supposed to do in life
Trying to move out of the dark and closer to the light
They say when you get a chance to do it over do it right
Cause tomorrow isnt promised every time we say goodnight
Listen hold up
Dope shot mugshot gun shot jump shot
Take your pick but you only got one shot
Advice from a school teacher to a young tot
Applying a sticker to a SpiderMan lunchbox
When even rolemodels tell us were born to be felons
And we aint getting into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And of these other peoples blessings were gonna be jealous
Its not fair that thats all they can tell us
Thats why I hustle hella hard I dont celebrate a holiday
That could be the day a brother couldve struck the lotteray
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So Im unapologetic Im on my calisthenics
If I have given it all Ive got I cannot regret it
My final destinations different from where I was headed
Cause Imma shoot for the stars to get it
One shot

6562,"Im about to take this beat and teach you bout the agony of defeat
In this football game in the street
And no it aint two hand touch its rough tackle
When niggas ball on your block and they bust at you
The fields full of players and they all trying to score
The whole team sits on the bench in the down pour
Cause no matter the weather the game dont stop
Competing with other teams that reign on top
Your offense gotta be cats with no conscience
Nononsense niggas with no options
That know how to carry that rock
Make the handoff and run off the block
Its hard to get first down when your new in this rough town
You sell a pound its a touchdown
And niggas see the pigskin they blast cops
So federal agents dress as mascots
Niggas hold weight but its not for lifting
The only white lines is the ones niggas sniffing
I know it sounds a bit different the only quarter is a quarter ki
If that aint a penalty it oughta be
And the concession stand is so sick
Serving you the cat rat and dog on a stick
But if you ask why somebody got slain
Yo its just an unfriendly game
The game dont stop cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what Im saying
Its just an Unfriendly Game
This aint America is it
This aint America is it
Where can I be
Yo ayo its Monday night
We on some watch the game shit
But I can go outside and still see the same shit
Cause look theres a bunch of niggas in a huddle
Looks like they calling the play
Come on kids dont be all in the way
Cause thats Pookie he the fucking quarterback
Cause he like to use the shotgun if he dont I know he got one
And thats Budda he the fucking running back
Cause he always say he gone quit
And he always wind up running back
The rest of them
Ill just say they play the line
Cause they like to protect Pookie and Pookie make them stay in line
And if they make a wrong move they penalized
Not by the referee but by Pookie brother Jeffery
And Jeff dont touch shit he sit and watch
Oversees the whole block from his own private luxury box
He the one that makes the deals happen
Smoking big cigars while his stars are in the field scrapping
But tonight the line of scrimmage got penetrated
The block got raided and everybody got traded
Now they wearing stripes in a pen
Guess thats how the game go
Nigga you dont know
Highlights at 10
Wednesday police arrested 12 men in a downtown drug raid
The cartel known on the streets as the Sharks
Was transporting large amounts of marijuana
In shipments of little league football equipment
Theres a new team in from out of town
Whats the sound
Out of bounds
And the front line niggas stay ready for the blitz sonny
So you wont make a sack of money
And every now and then somebody drops the ball
And the next team be right there to take it all
Now somebody new is trying to make a score in your territory
Its the same old story
And if you want your corner back you better wear a vest
Just in case you gotta catch a bullet to the chest
Believe me that shit can be a humdinger
Cause every quarterback in this leagues a gunslinger
The halftime shows kinda ill
Hood rat bitches dancing to Dru Hill
Another nigga down and out
A crackhead with no name yo
Its just an unfriendly game
The game dont stop cats keep playing
Some got hit hard and wound up laying
Out in the field but the fans keep paying
Understand what Im saying
Its just an Unfriendly Game
This aint America is it
This aint America is it
Where can I be

8032,"Raw Extended Alternate Version LyricsOne two doin a few for you
Intro I start to go my rhymesll flow so
Get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you are loungin around its time to get up
Pardon my expression but Imma tear shit up
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
I do declare Gettin busy is where its at
But with what youre sayin you wouldnt get a point for that
Cause youre a featherweight and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat
You say youre rockin How many shows you get
All your vocals go local on the MIC
Mines go a great distance like ATT
Im not new to this Im true to this nothin you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So yo go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme word for word verse for verse
Get you a nurse too late get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct I get respect
Im out to collect cash money but thats another subject
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin
To sound like me so soon Ill have to open
A school of emceein for those who wanna be in
My field and court but then again on second thought
To have MCs comin out soundin so similar
Its quite confusin for you to remember the
Originator and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator but Im much greater
Im A number one second to none
A sufficient title for me would be champion
Of any event in which I present
Fresh lyrics you hear it and mark them excellent
Very exquisite and explicit
Extraordinaire so what is it
Nothin but the finest your supreme Highness
Out to diminish delete and minus
All rappers thats inferior playin my area
Rhymes I recite will make them deteriorate away
And just get this straight
To compete I will defeat and totally humiliate
All imitation with the combination
Of rhymes more deadlier than Freddy or Jason
Ill be on ya like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know youd step the hell off
On a peaceful eve give me space to breathe
The way I be rockin you wouldnt believe
Im athletic energetic my rhymes are poetic
And while others are pathetic my style is copacetic
Innovator dominator rhyme creator
My rhymes are food for your party now allow me to cater
Cause Im the rappers idol and my title is so vital
MCs tryna take it Results are homicidal
All MCs try to handle me are led to misfortune and calamity
So to whom it may concern please try and learn
That in a battle with the Kane you just get burned
Cause Im a slayer rhymesayer thats out to kill
Progress manifest drop science and build
And any rapper tryna stop me from comin through
Like Chaka Khan I Feel For You
Destruction and corruption is what will occur
Much damage bein done as I injure
And when I get through rockin the mic like this
Youll have to thank the God Almighty if you still exist
Like that yall its like that yall
And when my Ballys run down I get taps yall
So Kool G Rap my mellow my man
Get on the mic with the gangsta plan
This little note is like a formula the antidote
For copycatters I quote they wanna deepthroat
Lyrics that I wrote placed upon a beat so neat
Orchestras and bands cant compete or compare
Or even come near to this here
This is a mere affair you just stare and cheer
Crystal clear to your ear perhaps some rappers are up there
To me theyre just Hollywood Squares
Music I create rotates on a plate
And I know some people hate me because Im great
Got a lot of females cause my records make sales
While the others on the shelf is goin slower than snails
And this shows the pros are so composed
Also enemies and foes to G Rap theyre only zeros
Not heroes theyre fractions minus the action of satisfaction
Also the brain of the main attraction
Im not mixed with any studio tricks
No special effects like you see in the flicks
Im dramatic so there you have it Im fantastic
Competitors are plastic stretch em like elastic
Then grab the microphone
And create a relaxin tone like a saxophone
If you dont like it then use the exit to hell with it
Im Kool G Rap and I made it I did it
Mission completed suckers are defeated
I sweated and bleeded but yet I succeeded
So please be aware that this is a war
If the shoe fits wear it cause thats what its made for
My metaphors are excellent yours are poor
My literature will score more for sure
The creature feature searcher preacher teacher
Torture rupture capture rapture reach ya
Musical master rhyme reacts as a
Brain that has the knowledge of NASA
Youre just a KitKat small as a TicTac
But Im a Big Mac cause Im G Rap
Well equipped with a hiphop lip
My memory bank is like a microchip
My bassll give a shake of an earthquake
Itll make you sucker MC wanna jump in the lake
Cause Im murder homicide comma
Crush kill destroy with excitement and drama
Speaker sound seeker you become weaker
My art is a smoker your material is mediocre
The rap Olympia devastate the area
Im gettin brainier lyrical mania
Power source energy enforced
Your headboards will need Red Cross
So come one or two step through a few
Doubles and couples and Ill cripple all triples huh
You cant handle it
None or any one or many some or plenty
Cause Im not a stranger just the rhyme arranger
Highly explosive keep out danger
Packin Gs while you try to be me
But for these MCs I call em the wannabe Gs
What I write is in the smokin section
Heres an injection of rap perfection
So what the heck You select my dialect
Next mans cassette yo reject and eject
Cause I could use a technique modern or antique
Beats never repeat show you that I can speak
Totally properly but rappers wanna copy me
This takes strategy just like Monopoly
Figure it out
Kool G Rap is about makin armies and crews look like Girl Scouts
Cause when I start rappin I keep the people clappin
Suckers that be yappin dont think that this can happen

5586,"At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 1 reasons youll never be this raw
My crew is representing for BK dont play
Or you might have to get Crime Watch around your way
Cause Brooklyn keep on taking it still from way back
Say black trying to get that fortune like Sajak
There must be at least twenty reasons you cant win and
In this rap game youre hopeless heres a top ten
10s very simple and plain its petty crime
Its only 94 when you wrote your first rhyme
And now you think you got more skill than power tools
But never could your feet fit up in our shoes
You only got one delivery
Onedimensional rappers is dead as chivalry
Dont get your spot blown up block sewn up
I lift MCs to tone up rip your zone up
I got more flavors than womens douche
Make ends with Mexicans and rock dreads in Flatbush
9 you cant see mine cant find mine
Cant do mine step to mine when my crew find
A frontingass nigga we get in this
You dont want to get beat and boxed like Biz
You aint wild cause you run with wild kids
Now the chorus is gonna tell you what 8 and 7 is
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
6 I bury that ass like Halle
All up on tracks like a trolley my golly
Like Bob Marley we jammin by all means
And real gangsters dont talk shit in magazines
5 never judge a rapper by the song he make
Some of the coolest rapping niggas will drop your ass in a lake
And on the other hand some of them screaming Keep it real
Their videos the only time they ever busted steel
4 you dont faze me this aint Star Trek
I know where you park your cars at as far as that
Beef thats going on in all these spots
In parking lots niggas pop more shit than shots
Funny dummy lyrics dont stun me
If I was your only pair of pants you still couldnt run me
Out this rap game its INC for life
Niggas gonna know soon cause Brownsvilles trife
All up in the mix like blenders
Offenders life enders whatever genders dont offend us
Coming at you gonna catch you and when we find you
Dont lose count let me remind you
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker
One two one two this be number trey
Might be in the game but I dont think you wanna play
Im coming with the flav getting more rich than Bey
I say this Master jam more than Jay
And two is my crew is coming with the newest
Cant do us knock your teeth out trying to cue us
You want to step to us come clean on the scene
Without the drama my team making all the green
Im in your spleen no afro with mad sheen
In my ride young teen girls getting mean
Every Day just like Mary J
Im downtown Brooklyn where niggas play
The corners and blocks like street lamps I beat champs
In rapping leaving niggas wondering what happened
And that be the number one reason you cant flow
But bring back the other two shits to let em know
At 8 youre a sucker at 7 a motherfucker

Of all their books and magazines not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible when they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered oer it not a fingerprint was plain
Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books youll find theres none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
Oh you can read your magazines of love and tragic things
But not one word of Bible verse not a scripture do you know
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
But its dust is covered oer it
And its sure to doom your poor soul
Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books youll find theres none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
Oh if you have a friend youd like to help along lifes way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burdens light
Is to dust the family bible trades the wrong way for the right
Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord

Got in my nose
As we carried our ladders down the street
With the wroughtiron gate rows
I went home and listened to Jimmie Rodgers

Bought five Woodbines at the shop on the corner
And went straight back to work
Oh Sam was up on top
And I was on the bottom with the V
We went for lemonade and Paris buns
At the shop and broke for tea
I collected from the lady and I cleaned the fanlight

Yo Whitney and Wyclef
Turn this up you gonna feel it up
Yo if I became broke tomorrow
Would I still be your pharaoh
Your ghetto Prince of Egypt
And if I got into a motorcycle accident and crashed
And became paraplegic
Yeah and if the feds rush the door
And find guns on the floor
And took us to federal court
Would you say they were yours
If I had to do a bid
Would you take care of the kids
And never let another nig in the crib
Keep the kitty licked yeah
Kristina 
If tomorrow is judgment day sing mommy 
And Im standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War Three
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
Its okay if youre coming with me
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us
If I lose my fame and fortune
It really dont matter 
And Im homeless on the streets
And Im sleeping in Grand Central Station okay 
Its okay if youre sleeping with me baby 
As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each others eyes
Each others eyes 
And no matter how old we get ooh
Its okay as long as I got you baby yeah yeah yeah
If I should die this very day
Dont cry cause on Earth
We wasnt meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
It really wont matter 
Ill be waiting for you
After the judgment day
Now I lay me down to rest
I pray that life dont get you stressed
If you should cry if you should break
I pray these streets dont take your life
Means more to me than that Rolley with the plat
Heard that Believe that I aint letting none of that
Go down when the feds come tell em none they my guns
And if they see me in the streets and wanna take my dough
Take my clothes for that price you can have my life
Yall shouting Dyme thats my name
Chicks spit fire Im putting out the flame
For life wifee mommy to baby girl
I wouldnt give it up for all the money in the world
Oh my time is up bricks to Mt Vernon

And said Here baby hit it

Youd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit
But Ill hit the blunt so she took out her fronts
Cracked the Phillie opened the bag and laid out the skunk

She ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later tossed the cover and oh brother I was with it
Ready to hit it asked my dick Yo wassup G

Fools acting like they dont know the rules
Need to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin jewels
Now they say is Mr Kane coming back to dominate
I used to listen to his music back in 1988
Damn he still pumpin just when you think he aint nothing
That kid just keep coming back what is he the Terminator or something
Lord I skill it in a way to make you feel it
Finally I reveal it party people they cant wait until

Can bring that old schooler back just like alumni
I sting it booyah to stop the half steppers tryin to wing it through ya
Dont make me have to bring it to ya
Who gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds

Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Please somebody help my soul
Talk to em talk to em 
I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me
Im holding onto my last bit of decency
I need a vacay a change of scenery
But mama said wherever Ima go Im taking me with me
I told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me
She got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me
Its not the drugs that got me out of my zone
Going days without eating in a crowd I feel alone mama
Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night
I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
I speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me
She told me theres a higher power and a lower power
And that Ill die if I dont find the strength to overpower
Then I replied well arent we all
She said yeah but that should be on Gods terms not yours
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
Tryin to weather the storm
I thought that black cloud was gone
Its been beside me all along not the song
I wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute
Tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute
Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs worse
Cant be depression couldnt have it this long
So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron my nigga
Speaking of secrets thats when I got the Kaylin text
Read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next
She said youre going through a lot
Im hoping you aint in the grave and dead
Cause not too many people know your brains a mess
Who knew that she was keeping track of it all
I wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all
I aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap
Pen and pad in my hand and I was writing a note
Didnt get far as soon as I wrote down mom I just stopped
Couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her
Couldnt explain the why to her
Couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her
And shortly after that my pastor called
Which at first I kinda thought it was weird
But that convo preserved me bout Gods grace and mercy
He aint even say goodbye he said let us pray
And then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes
Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear
Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured
Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour
All my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack
If everybody calls you a duck will you just quack
Guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back
Cause when I had that burner ready to bust I didnt clap
Joe
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But He tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human

Guess Im insanitys definition
Trying to step over in sanitys repetition
But I cant it got me tripping
Whatever love we had was dead that night
Looking back we both needed cooler heads that night
Was going off no sleep eyes red that night
While you was drunk texting me I hope I read that right
You was beefing bout Giselle beefing bout Alexa
Suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that I had sexed her
I was laughing thought it was funny
Giselles the homie Alexas twenty
With hip withdrawals
Nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
I wouldnt dick her at all
Im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me
Was there for four months yet you said this was a new me
In your head guess the answer to this jealousy
Was to turn around and try to make me jealous B
But the part that you neglect
Was never mind jealousy this was bout respect
Yall Instagramming pictures trying to get me upset
You turned that into a night we both would never forget
We both said some things we both probably regret
You was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool
Only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
Now Im fucking homeboy up just off the principle
I guess he caught him self antagonizing me
But hes a young nigga thats no surprising me
Shit I done fucked some of the baddest hoes
I left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho
I guess the part where I lose
Is now they got my face plastered all over the news Im being falsely accused
And I dont understand was this all part of a plan
I guess Ill tell the whole truth when on the stand
How you go and tell the cops I had guns in my house
Now they got a search warrant just to come to my house
Question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid
And you know Jersey gun laws Im talking hollow tips
So you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know whats going on
Nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
Your face is fine this is a big waste of time
Lets get back to that jealousy
Now you got a nigga facing three felonies
All for what cause we were no longer dealing
You attack me but Im the villain over a fucking iPhone and feelings
Check you never see me act like a jerk
I know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
Rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
Cause I go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait
So now the whole world is watching me get burned here
Which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here
Which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
Anytime theres a pole in the bar centered
So even though its from afar now
I still wish you the best I know your hearts tender
Im sorry all I just got my own scars to tend to
Signing off truly yours with love Gods sinner
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But he tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me
But they act like Im more than human
I prove them wrong again
Dont fault me Im only human
My every thought is scary
And it makes it hard to breathe again
Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror
Asking God to help me see again please help me
But he tells me Im only human
And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me

Please somebody help my soul Talk to em talk to em I let the Man have a talk with the beast in me Im holding onto my last bit of decency I need a vacay a change of scenery But mama said wherever Ima go Im taking me with me I told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me She got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me Its not the drugs that got me out of my zone Going days without eating in a crowd I feel alone mama Then she ask why it seems I never sleep at night I told her when I close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight She said my friends wanna have an intervention with me I speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me She told me theres a higher power and a lower power And that Ill die if I dont find the strength to overpower Then I replied well arent we all She said yeah but that should be on Gods terms not yours My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But He tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove them wrong again Dont fault me Im only human Tryin to weather the storm I thought that black cloud was gone Its been beside me all along not the song I wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute Tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute Kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first It was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram Percs worse Cant be depression couldnt have it this long So many secrets I only told to a glass of Patron my nigga Speaking of secrets thats when I got the Kaylin text Read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next She said youre going through a lot Im hoping you aint in the grave and dead Cause not too many people know your brains a mess Who knew that she was keeping track of it all I wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all I aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap Pen and pad in my hand and I was writing a note Didnt get far as soon as I wrote down mom I just stopped Couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her Couldnt explain the why to her Couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her And shortly after that my pastor called Which at first I kinda thought it was weird But that convo preserved me bout Gods grace and mercy He aint even say goodbye he said let us pray And then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes Just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear Maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured Just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour All my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack If everybody calls you a duck will you just quack Guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back Cause when I had that burner ready to bust I didnt clap Joe My every thought is scary And it makes it hard to breathe again Like Im blinded while Im staring in the mirror Asking God to help me see again please help me But He tells me Im only human And that Ill be back on my feet again please help me But they act like Im more than human I prove

I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest hmm
When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station runnin scared laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Asking only workmans wages I come lookin for a job
But I get no offers
Just a comeon from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there la la la la la la la
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than Ill be thats not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
And Im laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin home
Where the New York City winters arent bleedin me
Leadin me
Goin home

And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving but the fighter still remains

So keep hooking Ah ah ah lets hear it for 
Keep keep
Who can make it up Dark ages here in rap
And the constant conversation has been lets bring it back
Corny rap style niggas they lack the pedigree
Deep waters they be in when they are just the manatee
Who me I am unaffected the Whale the Hammerhead
The magnanimous decision unanimous I am fed
What you looking at Wait I can help you with that
The formidable unforgettable painting Abstract
On the wall amongst them all from Warhol to JeanMichel
A commodity hot property heres the morning bell
Guantanamo Bay and niggas deferring routes
Your soliloquies are trash inferring that you got clout
But homie whats that about You should revisit your scheme
Before the schemin seems real reverts back to a dream
Into that pea head of yours you aint commanding no tours
You seeing fee and per diem we seeing that in the door
Plus a little bit more because she choosing the prettiest
The wiliest wittiest on the low we the grittiest
Taking the task these barbaric insurgents
Who nurseryrhyme niggas and play like they are crime figures
Man what could give you such a naive belief
Theres examples all around of careers being brief
The Luke Cage of the loose leaf page run and hide
Comin out in the yard bona fide to be hard
So keep hooking

As if we reading pressures higher we should all be that inspired
Too just lift it and take it higher peep the name thats on the flyer
The Midnight Marauder low end theoretical
Ring tone rappers rockin shades are forgettable
Phantom of the rapper Boo Yo you Puss in Boots
Energies electricute looking for a love recruit
High definition for the fortunate you to view
Challenges with riches we will put you on strict review
Time to turn the tide around comin with the tribal sound
Brandishing these microphones we outlaws in the town
Corruption in the fool pit we witness the jam
Acquisition of materials the evil of man
Trickles down to MCs we combat the disease
With the good and hardy measurement a real rap sediment
Degenerate genes and your bodies the host
You need to open up wide while we give you the douse

4506,"Theres big pieces of a life she cant remember
Her mind shuts down its trying to protect her
Might be for the best to forget but it seems like
They always reappear when she least expects
Late nights we lay awake drowning in the lake that pours out of her face
Years late but shes still not safe
Memories leap out ant time any place
The way he smelledthe way he smiled
The evil she even recognized as a child
Hand on her throat sting of a fist
Instead of her first kiss she got this
Shameful feeling painful secret
Lonely knowin that nobody would believe it
Every wound that escapes her time capsule
Hurts like the day it was born and its brand new
I wasnt there babygirl but Im here
I dont know what to say I just hear
If theres one wish I could make true
I would shoulder that pain and take it off you
Dont run babygirl dont run
You gotta face what you fighting head on
Only one thing I could say in truth
You gotta deal with the demons before they deal with you
How can she find peace in her mind when
Love means returning to the scene of a crime
I can feel it inside weve reopened wounds every time we intertwine
Such an evil design when you cant even enjoy the sweetness you find
Trying to see through the tears in your eyes and rebuild your shrine one piece at a time
E K made it all fade away
Colors dont burn no more its all gray
Cant find heaven from within that shell but its enough of a blessing if just not seen hell
Constant inner dialog says just end this roller coaster ride youre on
Only one solution seems final slide into a hole where your pain cant find you
She said if I was meant to die he wouldve killed me
There must be a reason that I still breathe
I dont have the tools to rebuild me
But I still believe that one day I could feel free
And my body can be mine again
My eyes can learn how to shine again
My inner child wont have to hide and then
When Im strong then love could be invited in
Sweet God thats all I ask of thee
Im willing to give what you demand of me
Im learning to embrace the reality
That life doesnt always turn out how its planned to be
I didnt deserve what was handed me
Only one who can grant happiness is me
What it takes for her to face the day
I can only hope to be half that brave

Aint no puff and pass please roll your own I do the same
Girl get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryna pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame thats why youre not used to this game
And if you lookin for me Ill be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landin gear cause I dont need no runway
My final destination is a cloud its a oneway
Fuckin with them streets aint no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I dont never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets never on no sober shit
Posttraumatic stress I feel like thats what Im copin with
So I smoke the best impossible not to notice this
30000 feet up I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time aint even over yet
Im tryna live my life so when its over I got no regrets
The keys to success multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it til its over with
Napa Valley Dolce my cup runneth over with
My trunk is in my roof ayy you know who you rollin with
Hussle
I know a place we can go where you can be yourself
You aint gotta worry and we aint gotta rush cause we not in no hurry

In a time when were spending billions of dollars
In a war to control oil in Iraq
Threethousand soldiers have come home in coffins
Hundreds of thousands of Iraq civilians have lost their lives
Our brothers and sisters in New Orleans
Are left homeless and hungry
They murdered Sean Bell
They murdered Amadou Diallo
They murdered Timothy Stansbury
And its time to say no more
No more No more No more No more
I got so much trouble on my mind refuse to lose
Heres your ticket uh
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to black attack
So I sat and japped then slapped the Mac
Now Im ready to mic it huh
Hear my favoritism roll oh
Never be a brother like me go solo
Lazer Anastasia maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way Im livin forgiven what Im givin up
X on the flex Hear me now 
I dont know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man Ive had it up to here
Gear I wear got em goin in fear
Rhetoric said it read just a bit ago
Not quittin it signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from gettin jerked
Changin some ways to way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold never follow the code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause its comin from the heart
What I got better get some Mmhmm 
Hustler of culture
Snake bitten been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fittin
Respects been givin hows ya livin
Now I cant protect a pad off the defect
Check the record of reckon
An international wreck played off as some intellect
Made the call took the fall broke the laws
Not my fault that theyre fallin off
Known as fair square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the terrordome
Come on down Get down 
You can get it get it get it get it
Come on down
You can get it get it get it get it
Get down
You can get it get it get it get it
Theres a hole in an apple an apple has been rotten
Scheme like the Klan I plan like Bin Laden
Supreme screen writer slick street editor
Drop the LP and he hit like Hezbollah
Seven years later its the year of the Gods
United States government is just a facade
The Catholic Church got ties with the mob
I see it all like The Wizard of Oz
Now theres a yellow brick road the fame riches and cars
If you only had a brain you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation cut your education
Secret information world domination
Take over reservations trigger the energies
In the oceans for tsunamis to control the population
Eyes in the sky hidden observation
If youre over sixtyfive theyll take away your medication
Like Give me that Give me that Fall in line Fall in line 
Go to war Go to war press rewind
Cause when I get mad I put it down on the pad
Give you somethin that you never had
Controllin fear of high rollin
God bless your soul and keep livin
Black to the bone my home is your home
Well welcome to the terrordome
Come on down Get down 
You can get it get it get it get it
Come on down

5301,"It was a cafe It was a cafe on the west side
It was a cafe On
It was a cafe On the west side midtown
It was a cafe On the west side midtown
Said they had the best cap of Cappucino around
So I stepped in and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said Shut the fuck up
And I did pronto quick fast
How much longer would the torture last
In the wrong place at the wrong time
It was a drug sale I could feel from behind
Death it was gettin closer right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot out and then I died
I could feel it I was on the other side
In between lives Im so confused
What do I do oh what do I do
But was it really time for me to go
Why oh why did I need Cappucino
Why oh why
Why oh why did I need Cappucino
Why oh why
Why oh why did I need Cappucino
Why oh why did I need Cappucino
But then I calmed down I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin over his girl
Another died drivin while intoxicated
Why do people make livin so complicated
But then I saw a girl her name was Mary
Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldnt listen no one listens
I saw the light I awakened it was a dream
Man oh man you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given my life back
So good to be livin or is dead better
I didnt have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didnt have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didnt have to worry about fallin from a plane
But at this caf was death still callin my name
Or did this caf even exist
And was my name just another on the death list
I knew it couldnt happen even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of Cappucino
Cappucino Cappucino
Bust it to some of you that really dont know
I break it down to you the word Cappucino
Its somewhat like coffee then again not quite
Its creamy and smooth and it goes down light
They charge you 3 dollars you ask is it worth it
But when you start drinkin shit itd be workin
Im hooked well I was cause yo its the best
But if every time I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly but too fly for me
Why oh why did I need Cappucino
Cappucino
Why oh why did I need Cappucino
Cappucino
Why oh why Why oh why
Why oh why did I need Cappucino
Cappucino Cappucino
Cappucino Cappucino
It was a caf on the west side
It was a caf on the west

2488,"Miami 2017 Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway Lyrics
Ive seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the Empire State laid low
And life went on beyond the Palisades
They all bought Cadillacs and left there long ago
They held a concert out in Brooklyn
To watch the Island bridges blow
They turned our power down
And drove us underground
But we went right on with the show Oh oh oh 
Ive seen the lights go out on Broadway
I saw the ruins at my feet
You know we almost didnt notice it
Wed seen it all the time on 42nd Street
They burned the churches up in Harlem
Like in that Spanish Civil War
The flames were everywhere
But no one really cared
It always burned up there before Oh oh oh 
Ive seen the lights go out on Broadway
I watched the mighty skyline fall
The boats were waiting at the Battery
The union went on strike they never sailed at all
They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
And picked the Yankees up for free
They said that Queens could stay
They blew the Bronx away
And sank Manhattan out at sea
You know those lights were bright on Broadway
That was so many years ago
Before we all lived here in Florida
Before the Mafia took over Mexico
There are not many who remember
They say a handful still survive
To tell the world about
The way the lights went out
And keep the memory alive

6608,"Hi my names Ludacris and Im high as giraffe pussy
And Im close to the edge so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin a fool from the traps to the burbs
My filthy mouth it wont fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and put my old teeth back
I take a shit on the equator the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
Its the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin
But no pork on my fork I dont even speak pig Latin
I go fishin on my lake with yo bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MCs but I dont gain no weight
The numba one chief rocka clean out yo rap lockers
Im as stiff as a board yall more shook than maracas
But my trix aint for kids if you digum youll get smacked
Ill clock ya Ill spring forward you fall back
Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
Thats cause Im a shot caller yall fools is Crank Yankers
Aint a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland Oregon to Portland Maine
Now I roll up torpedoes get blunted with rastas
For a hefty fee Im on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys Im a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell em I want a fullcourt press Ow 
So momma toast your glass while Im countin my cash
Cause every single is a smash Im hot as a camels ass
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash
From yo car to a crap game no one rolls witchu
One of MiniMes shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record aint spinnin
Im in the strip club smokin with President Clinton
So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They made the mold of the penis enlarger off me Me 
Ill be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerators taller than Shaq Yeah 
So yippie kay yay yippie yie yie yo Yo 
If you cant swim dont smoke my hydro Dro 
Ive been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of yall are mo stuck up than tampons Woo 
So wash all your sins away and stop playin Yeah 
If Gods line is busy you might have to twoway him Mhm 
Then catch me in your backyard playin croquet
And when Im drunk tell them kids Drugs are bad mmmkay
Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoes off Pico
Got seven cars get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think Im bad they say Ooh hes so evil
Cause I go on blind dates with actual blind people Ow 
But my albums out the store yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot so yall keep to yourself
Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that yall talkin yall can pop it to them
Cause Ludacrisll beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant
Im the man I got money far as the eyes can see
And Im in a group I split dough with me me and me
So much money in my jewelry that Im damn near sorry
So Ima trade my earrings in and get a Ferrari Woo 
I buy cars with straight cash have meetings with Donald Trump
Yall meet with Honda no payments for twelve months Uhhuh

2635,"Now I wanna tell you a little story
About the old demon alcohol
Yes indeed my little chickadee
Here is a story about a sinner
He used to be a winner
Who enjoyed a life of prominence and position
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements
And his selfish wifes fanatical ambition
It turned him to the booze
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision
The floosie made him spend his dough
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission
Its such a shame
Oh demon alcohol
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would say
Damn it all and blow it all
Oh demon alcohol
Memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol
Barley wine pink gin
Hell drink anything
Port pernod or tequila
Rum scotch vodka on the rocks
As long as all his troubles disappeared
But he messed up his life when he beat up his wife
And the floosies gone and found another sucker
Shes gonna turn him on to drink
Shes gonna lead him to the brink
And when his moneys gone
Shell leave him in the gutter
Its such a shame
Oh demon alcohol
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
Damn it all low low
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol

Hear the whistle blow
Bought a ticket of her own accord

Packed her heart in a travellin bag
And never said byebye
Something missin in the neighborhood

Knew her favorite tune
Gone shootin

Wrapped herself around
Like a second skin
Backed her favorite nag

I took an offer in another town

Its a beautiful day in the neighborhood

8155,"Yo
We got broke niggas woke niggas who want smoke niggas
I fucked with Scott Storch so you know we got coke
Niggas fake with having Im lacing karats
Darlings in the states and Paris amazed the fabrics
I was rich when they wasnt still rich when you was
Men it is what it is Im a habitual plug
If I said it you say I was pathological
Got shot twice a night I checked myself out the hospital
I was pumping Keith Sweat had the gun in these sweats
Talks of killing his moms I couldnt live with regrets
Coco
Yooh yooh
So many bitches I swear Im a dickless
Now that the bags is different to talk different
Alright here we go
Yo here we go
Yo
So many bitches I swear Im a dickless
Now that the bags is bigger they talk different
She want the best life now so heres your wish miss
Weve been shitting or some about to do Christmas
Off white colored a truck to the hood love them toys
Aint no future and theres some good love and joy
Skin brown color on the joy
We mashed potatoes on the arms to avoid the noise
I told flex Im a thug man Im a die fly
Chanel forego 60 bands New Yorks flag
I chop the top off the Porshe when it we convert
My Cleopatra in Dubai try make me convert Im saying
Salam alaykom my uni country you know listen
Um
Trendsetters pristine boys niggas their ice
We woke up at the awards every rapper just like me
I inspire the bosses
Shit Ive been moving white like fire in crosses
No trump intended
Made me a menace thats work on the team playing when
Zach was on Memphis
When he win for the grounds real dont tell you how
Theres some other motherfucking clown will
And you could think spike for the motion pictures
A couple Jesus aint nice thats the frozen scriptures
Team rocking I mean Remi popping Drake popping
Pick and roll caught him M alone and Im Stockton
And you wonder why them niggas depress
We selling the same dope I just picture the best is coca
Uhhuh yeah
I done survive in the Bronx amongst killers and thieves
Hustled in the cold and below zero degrees
Id have seen shit that most probably wouldnt believe
So the second time on Flex fitting to be a breeze
Yo Flex respect to all these MCs stepping this far
The lyrical MCs please keep rapping them bars
The bar set they reach now Im resetting that bar
Promised yall by tomorrow Im gonna be mentioned with God
This is me catching the charge premeditated murder one
The cheese like my son the truth you never heard a son
Huh you heard Im fronting then somebody lied
You heard somebody did something to me somebody died
And if they didnt kill him bet somebody tried
So if hes still alive then God was on somebodys side
Somebody try to defined Myse no definition
One of the best cats thatspitting that get no recognition
I repping dudes sitting in prison when 90 something didnt numbers
And 90 summers to some of our closest friends from us
Dumb us we let these retreats not much
Jay Z tried tell us dont let this shit become us
What you see thats how they want us beef and fueling
Among us chasing the fame wearing the same chains that hung us
Then they lock us up for the same cane that brung us
We got to change the game but just maintain the hunger
The aim is getting younger theyre shooting at our babies now
Feminizing men dudes moving like ladies now
They said you sound like a hater sometimes I say
Nah I tell the truth is only hate when you lying
Theyve been waiting to find my kind
Divine being a shining McDonalds climax by just using my mind
Cuz nah I dont touch em see what they did to Russell
Some of these chicks done turning rape into hustle
Now have you really been assaulted and rape mind me I love you
I swear if I was there how to shot the coward for you
But listen Im trying to tell you that shit is a scam
They trying to divide the black women and men
So as the black man I stand right up here and I apologize
For that pain and neglect that left ya traumatize
You see when my father died I swear my mama tried
To turn me to a man I aint fell she is qualified
Thats why I went outside and I witnessed the homicides
And the drug dealers whoever was shooting we idolize
Thats why I despise when the rats got idolized
You played the game of snitch technical fault you disqualified
Nigga I defied them odds and I survived
Im 2Pac Shakur meets knowledge is modernized
They say that I provide a feeling thats undenied
Barring nobody I am the realest nigga alive
Your feelings then you died or you just dealing with pride
Yeah I know that I be spreading all bullshit and decides
For the minute that yall decide to celebrate authenticity
Every category you have its gonna mention me nigga
I gave him history facts bars consistently
How the hell they dont respect that its a mystery
So fuck yall listen they dont mean shit to me
Seeing my people revolve is my victory
Harry Belafonte well I call him Mr B
Said I had a gift God gave that gift to me
To lead the people from bondage and out of misery
Swami speak the truth to the Reaper come and visit me
You see my mission different thats why I see shit differently
Shit you might see a success I might disagree
Chick you might be paying for sex I might get for free
I think its lame to pay for sex but it might just be me
Maybe its just the grease levels and different leagues
Im war already thats why Im always in fatigue
Listen please dont get it confused because
Im elevating them switching my views and Im uplifting my dudes
I flip quick you get shit misconstrued
And I put a nigga in the clip on the news
So youre gonna choose which one you want me this preaching the unity
Or to me that be the reason your people reading your eulogy
I know its a contradiction understand its two of me
Its the goons Myse from the Bronx then its the new of me
Its the whole of me thats comfortable where the shooters be then the revolutionary newer version of Huey P
Flex can you agree that I did what I told you
I came up here and I shifted the culture they listening closer
They robbed me different they dont switch they approach up
That bullshit spitting is over now and they listened to Hova
444 tell me I aspire death Im flattered but I aint really buying that
But what I will say is that they wasnt jacking that kind of rap
Before I came up here stop me where Im lying at
Iron sharpens iron nigga I brought the fire back
I eat a tiger I brought lions that retired back
Real going admire that but the fake going down play
Swear these squares uncomfortable around me Why
Cuz I proudly point out they fraudulence
Then I expose these actors to their audience
Yall be ignorant that they dont move according to that shit that they recording and yall still applaud it me
Im reporting it live from the corners
When they do crime and get more time than Warner
You see Im trying to warn you its no more honor nah
They done trading these principles for designer
Your righthand man might kill you for some vagina
And the so called jeez get pistols to the minors
And this will yall be trying to compare to me
From where I swear this whole industry scared of me its clear
This shit its just like breathing enemies Im guard here
You should be making a prayer to me its rare
Youll see another rapper thats this complete
That speak like a scholar while honor like Pistol Pete
When his drama Im the piranha trying to get the meat pause
Im kind of like white collar mixed with street on my momma
Im just the lead Im not heart beat her the streets
I am the place where life and art seem to meet
See first I palm heat then I laid on Palm Beach
Now I got the world on my palm my song speak
And they stop looking they listen they pay attention
Because they be saying the same shit I just say it different
I just paint a picture of dimensions they cant mention
Cuz they aint bended it when they spit it it aint convincing
The image they predict aint the position
The image they predictable bars aint their position
Of course everybody gonna say they was in the kitchen
But what about the block getting locked facing that prison
When either you gonna tell what you wont sit in that cell
Everybody a G before that thats when its real
Now thats when you can tell the morals have finished still
When your back against the wall your character get revealed
So either you gon squeal and try to make you a deal
Or youre gonna pick 12 and you lose weight on the pill
I know that and going pill to a coward or civilian
With the Gs no I just kept with a million
Tell me how does it feel you sit witnessing greatness
The doubters is sick I know that haters gonna hate this
With the real rice been waiting for me to take this game
Back from the fake so please pardon my lateness but
I was busy fighting for freedom
These kids needed food for thought I had to feed them
They needed something to follow I had the lead em
Men of honour was becoming this thing I had to breed them
Chicks keep calling me God all in my DMs
No disrespect but God aint that your BM
Guess she realized your fraud
See a queen could tell the difference between a king
And the pawn when she see him
And yup I am here my motto is copper dim
Growing up in the Bronx and my heart darker than pm
And pool full of sharks I learned to swim
They hid their hands after they threw the rocks that I turned into gems
Nigga we turning men way before puberty shit
By age ten it wasnt nothing yall could do to me
America have ruined me Poverty real hunger
Oppression pain same shit that may kill Manga
And they still wonder what Im marching for
To identify allies when its time for war
Which Ill gonna do when they declare martial law
And then the soldier with guns knocking at your door huh
You aint even prepared
The revolution done starting you aint even aware
You see the Dred Scott case takes
We cant be free and these United States cause we aint even from here
Long as Im breathing this air until its even and fair
Ima fight cuz one thing I dont believe in its fear
I guess the reason Im here is to maintain the balance nigga
Im the place between peace and balance
Between screaming and silence ignorance acknowledge nigga
Just fighting off these demons is a challenge
It is the talent just keepin my composure
While you beef with me knowing I could fold you
Knowing if I told my soldier he would mow you
Down like a lawn you see is pros vs cons
Is knowing that Im in the right but its still wrong
Its chess why sacrifice the knight for a pawn
Yo flex Im gone before I leave your residence
I hope you realize this is black excellence
This is black brilliance black power resilience
The Black Panther not to film the real shit
This black Wall Street time to rebuild this
We need a thousand Oprahs and a thousand Will Smiths
We need celebrities of a higher pedigree
To have some integrity that one to leave a legacy
Shit Im fighting for Im probably aint gonna never see
But my kids will just hope today remember me
Hope today remember he defied the odds
He played the hand he was dealt never shuffle the cards
A1 since day one he never fuck with no frauds
He frontlined and never get you nothing but bars
Nothing but the uncut raw shit they make your nose bleed
The Bible verses the shit that niggas souls need
The OG told me it was designed to divide us brother
Cuz even in Wakanda we is fighting each other
So just imagine if we was all fighting together
We all be winning and all of our lives would be better
Good people died just so I can have a life
And thats why I give my life as a sacrifice
Good people died just so I can have a life
And thats why I gave my life as a sacrifice

Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her mommas knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma dont believe her

3307,"I come from down in the valley
Where mister when youre young
They bring you up to do
Like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
Wed drive out of this valley
Down to where the fields were green
Wed go down to the river
And into the river wed dive
Oh down to the river wed ride
Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday
I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress
That night we went down to the river
And into the river wed dive
Oh down to the river we did ride
Ahyah
I got a job working construction
For the Johnstown Company
But lately there aint been much work
On account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I dont remember
And Mary acts like she dont care
But I remember us riding in my brothers car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks Id lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath shed take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it dont come true
Or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Ahyahyah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride
Ahyahay
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh

Verse One Chubb Rock
Here we go
To the consumer and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I come backwards on stuff you dont deny
If you try to act fly then Ill punk you I and I
When I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise to invade the media shame
Take it insult call me the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lees a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it OJ he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid the drug addict
If you missed me dont kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one
Verse Two BizMarkie
Ladahdi ladahda I like to say

I gotta pass it over to my man Chubb
Verse Three Chubb Rock
From the glass clear era thats the point of the one
Be unique critique from the crumb me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it cheerio kid and here I go
Off beat slackin but the platinum mediocre rappers
With the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The acoustic suits it the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs well it should Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise super star in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild child in the rubadub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out with my rubber band

Then when she said she was going to like wreck my car
I didnt know what to do

It may sound funny but youd think by now Id be smiling
I guess some things never change
Oh never change
I met an old cowboy I saw the look in his eyes
Something tells me hes been here before cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child when the thought first came to me
That Im a son of a gun and the gun of a son that brought back the devil in me
Oh but sometimes I feel like Im beating a dead horse

6578,"Theres nothing more refreshing That cool refreshing drink 
Than a cool crisp clean glass of water
On a warm summers day That cool refreshing drink 
Try it with your friends
New World Water make the tide rise high
Come inland and make your house go Bye My house 
Fools done upset the Old Man River
Made him carry slave ships and fed him dead niggas
Now his belly full and he about to flood somethin
So Im throwin rope that aint tied to nothin
Tell your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since
The New World Water and every drop counts
You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna
But it dont rain a full week some summers
And its about to get real wild in the half
You be buying Evian just to take a fuckin bath
Heads is acting wild sippin poor puffin dank
Competin with the next man for higher playin rank
See I aint got time tryin to be Big Hank
Fuck a bank I need a twentyyear water tank
Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweatin they goods
The sun is sitting in the treetops burnin the woods
And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher
They say Dont drink the water We need it for the fire
New York is drinkin it New World Water 
Now all of California is drinkin it New World Water 
Way up North and Down South is drinkin it New World Water 
Used to have minerals and zinc in it New World Water 
Now they say it got lead and stink in it New World Water 
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Push the water table lopside
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam across the sea
Man you gotta cook with it bathe and clean with it Thats right 
When its hot summertime you fiend for it Let em know 
You gotta put it in the iron you steamin with Thats right 
Its what they dress wounds and treat diseases with Shout it out 
The rich and poor black and white got need for it Thats right 
And everybody in the world can agree with this Let em know 
Consumption promotes health and easiness Thats right 
Go too long without it on this earth and you leavin it Shout it out 
Americans wastin it on some leisure shit Say word 
Another nation be desperately seekin it Let em know 
Bacteria washing up on they beaches Say word 
Dont drink the water son they cant wash they feet with it Let em know 
Young babies in perpetual neediness Say word 
Epidemics hoppin up off the petri dish Let em know 
Control centers try to play it all secretive Say word 
To avoid public panic and freakiness Let em know 
There are places where TB is common as TV
Cause foreignbased companies go and get greedy
The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line
Have it purified sell it for a dollar twentyfive


Now the world is drinkin it New World Water 
Your moms wife and baby girl is drinkin it New World Water 
Up North and Down South is drinkin it New World Water

I can see the reality
Cause when you shook me took me out of my world

Then you better beware of the happening

When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose that precious love you need

And wed count our many blessings one by one

7374,"When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
Im quick to buck a duck and I dont give a fuck about 50
A hardcore life I chose to explore
Therefore I lived raw and went to war with the law
My only picture was a mug shot slugs what thugs got
Pockets swellin hot from sellin tops on the drug spot
Gs was clocked fat knots went in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
Cause I choose to use a gun dont mean that I cant fight
Cause we could put the guns down and go one round
With the hands my man I aint the one youll get done clown
I can inverse my style cause Im versatile
Quick to burst a child Im livin worse than foul
I pack two tecs in case your crew flex
I wet up the set in a sec and yell Whos next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft
Turn your staff into a bloodbath then laugh
Youll get smashed like a deli snack youre softer than jelly jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat
On one three ninth street Malcolm X boulevard
Its full of hard brothers thats thick and quick to pull a card
I tell facts when the beat start
Listen here sweetheart the Big L is street smart
I fuck ducks and they crews up make em give the jewels up
For those who refuse I squeeze the uz and light them fools up
I had beef with this nigga named Randolph
Now hes in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
A beat down from Big L thats what all pranksters get
Like Al Yankovic Im on some real gangster shit
Im never fuckin with no handicapped or crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and youll see triple sixes
Crimes I committed Im a villain admit it
Im the type to murder you then tell your moms Im the kid who did it
Peace and love is somethin that I dont rhyme about

Some niggas dont like me but I dont give a fuck though
Cause Im in command yall
Im smackin niggas up like Puerto Ricans play handball
I aint the funny type
To joke around I gotta get my motherfuckin money right
Cause I got the right game
Definitely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
Im rolling numbers with no practice
Im snatchin up the dough like motherfuckers owe taxes
Cause I got strategy
Im rollin head crack trips and makin all the brothers mad at me
Word Im taxin shit
Im shittin on niggas like I just had a laxative
Tryin to earn props I aint the one to see
You clownsll fuck around and get played like a drum machine
Ya gotta find a better way
Ill pull ya card your file shit plus your resume
Cause I dont play clown
I gotta get mine thats why my face stay frown
I dont smile dont try to pull my file
Ill lay your ass like tile you know my motherfuckin style
So just slow down cause yall cant throw down
And yall cant accept that a niggas makin dough now
And Im livin better troop
And Im makin more noise than a fuckin heavy metal group
Im a cool man a brother with a smooth plan
Thats why Im seein more papers than a newsstand
So peep it dont try to run around or speak it
Point blank I keep my whereabouts secret
While niggas are packin steel actin ill

She four reading Cornrows by Camille Yarborough

I keep her mind free she aint no black zombie

For beauty shining through like the sun at the highest noon
From the top of the cable car at Table Mountain I am you
Girls with the skyest blue of eyes and the darkest skin
For Cape Coloured for realizing were African
For all my cousins back home the strength of Mommys backbone
The length of which she went for raising sacrificing her own
The pain of not reflecting the range of our complexions
For rubber pellet scars on Auntie Elnas back I march
Fist raised caramel shining in all our glory
For Mauritius St Helena my blood is a million stories
Winnie for Joan and for Eadie for Norma Leslie Ndidi
For Auntie Betty for Melanie all the same family
Fiona Jo Burg complex of mixed girls
For surviving through every lie they put into us now
This worlds yours and I swear I will stand focused
Black girls raise up your hands the world should clap for us

I missed you too
I waited a long time for this
So why you aint come see me no commissary or nothin
I aint wanna see my bird in no cage
But Im ready to take care of you now
Now after three years
Three motherfuckin years nigga You know what
Hasta la vista byebye kiss your kids
Its the gangstresses
What you think this is nigga
Calm yourself its just a little robbery
You got stricken with the poverty starvin me
Call me Sunshine pussy spread like the rainbow
Spectaculous miraculous
I practice this for a livin like the Buddhism
Nam myoho renge kyo
Ask Tina love aint got shit to do with me and you
Or the 44 under the pillow
Put in the dildo I like to play while Im workin
And thats for certain
Keep jerkin I aint done with you
Lights cameras curtains
In a second
The show begins
Invite your family and friends
They gotta see this
Oh they wouldnt believe this
You got stuck and left naked with a hard penis
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe

If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
I heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
Out on me by your man Big D
Stink cucarachas I bought his life for 3 Gs
Then some watches then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin goin on
We caught him down at the Shark Bar up in Marks car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin in they Morays sippin Dom Ps and Cristies
I reminisce how it used to be
On the run from police we bust shotties out of Maseratis
Bloody bodies in the telly lobbies
When in need I lied for ya I cried for ya
You know this downass bitch woulda died for ya
I used to sweat you but now forget you
Id rather dead you and wet you like I never met you
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me

It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough
And I remember how you said you loved me
With the passion
High fashion
Who you askin
To keep the tum numb from index to thumb
Push the Vs with the coke from the DTs
Dope take the titties from city to city
I aint see a G off none of them kis
At ease when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if I didnt snitch youd make a shorty rich bitch
I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin on the Peter Pan to Maryland
Was worth the bitch marryin
This nigga I so worked so hard for
Chose my life to be hardcore
Laws didnt appeal no more
Gats I couldnt feel no more
And now Im the shit
Go by the name of Lil Kim the Queen Bitch
And MAFIAs lieutenant
Instead of playin Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream and dinero
It dont pay to be nice but its nice to pay
And if you die before you wake may your soul God take
It dont take nothin for you to love me babe
It dont take nothin for you to love me
If youre feelin like I do then I know you want it too
It dont take nothin for you to spend a little dough

No chain nada jewelry that jackers cant snatch
The gingerbread the slave masters cant catch

The oldtimers say were living in the final days
Gun smoke young folks living any kind of way
Gangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways

5367,"Distraction Occupy Wall Street Freestyle LyricsNowadays we be rocking glasses for fashion
And fucking with life a fraction
Covered in Max Factor hustling assbackwards
As sure as HiTek look like Richard from Last Dragon
Your focus on bogus rappers got you caught up in distraction
Distraction Who fucking who Who cares Thats distraction
You wish it was you dont you why you asking
Try to break the law of attraction
Get a piece of my attention like a fraction of a ration
Or a measly little morsel
They suck your blood and you believe in the immortals
We nocturnal like a sleeping disorder
See the water drawing away from the shore
This aint no ordinary storm
We killing for a humanitarian cause
But have yet to show up in Darfur
The Arab Spring is what its called
But its looking at the pride before the fall
They say it aint about the spoils of war
But turn around and tell you how much more the oil will cost
Steal the land from the Native American and call the missiles Tomahawks
Make him a mascot dress up like him for sport
As a final assault to his beautiful culture
Scavengers feasting on the dead like a vulture
Snacking how you keeping up with my rapping
You barely keeping up with Kardashians
You caught up in distraction
Its the living proof you try to make the truth elastic as Mr Fantastic
We recycling these rappers
Truthfully these niggas is plastic
Coming through the front door blasting
I aint talking bout them emails
That you always send to the masses
That somehow end up in my trash bin
My niggas got the aim of sharpshooters and the hearts of assassins
All this war all this life all this passion
The game is distraction
Give a fuck if the President wear a flag pin
Rhyming is deep as holes Chilean miners are trapped in
Or the cracks in the earth under Asia Minor causing disasters
My deep cuts way above your minor infractions
Talk to rappers like children cause thats how they acting
They holding their hands like minors in traffic
The captains of industry and the lovers of status quo
Have a deepseeded fear of change
For them its strange they wanna go
Back to the 50s they asking for a return
But them days is much blacker for lack of a better term
We adapted to the times but this culture we had to learn
Came about as natural as a perm on a pachyderm
These fascists have had their turn
We packing them German burners them Lugers
The next shooters waiting for Superman they get nothing but Lex Luthor
Americas nightmare vivid as Fred Kruger
Our heroes are dead to us
Spirit that bled through us
Endear us with the spirit so the flow is so foolish
What you hearing is precision
The people so thirsty what they seeing is mirages
But this passion Photoshopping and your YouTube collages
Coming through like Collossus
Exposing the false prophet
Taught how to do the knowledge so Im never offtopic
A lie is like a potion
First it gets you open
Then you swallow whole straight for the truth
Fuck the chaser skip religion and the politics
And head straight to the compassion
Everything else is a distraction

President Ford says that hes disappointed
With Congresss performance
In Detroit a Pontiac Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A headon collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the ninemonth deadlock
Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day

949,"A winters day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock
I am an island
Ive built walls
A fortress steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
Its laughter and its loving I disdain
I am a rock
I am an island
Dont talk of love
Well Ive heard the word before
Its sleeping in my memory
I wont disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock
I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock
I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries

Ask Steve Jobs wealth dont buy health

3379,"They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym
He fell like a rock she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder as they moved cross the floor
When the music was over she slipped out of his arms and out the door
Yeah a man loves a woman but he cant understand
Why shes sad when she stares at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club where the long shadows fall
Drops a coin in the jukebox not the phone on the wall
So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow maybe more than today
Were so close so close yet so far away
Some people think if you really believe
Thats what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yea I know someone who just heads for the sun
She says I dont wanna be wise I just wanna stay young
So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow though were stuck in today
Baby were so close so close yet so far away
Theres a restless look in your eye tonight
Theres a secret hurt in my heart
And the dream that pulls us together girl
Is a dream thats gonna tear us tear us apart
Theres a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh are you lookin for some way out of here
We gotta fight to keep it together girl
For the dream that keeps us
So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
Who would of thought girl that wed end up this way
Getting so close so close
So far away
Were living in a dream world
Yet were livin today girl

And keep it out of the spotlight
Yeeah
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Yeeah
I like to flow like water
They like to blow the fuck up
I get the dough
But on the low
Im about to show you whats up
Phenomenal the rhyming poet
Ive been holding your touch
It might engulf your mind
and goals in life 
To show youre not up
To par with
The rapper its not cool
To spar with
Finding it better to lay in the cut
And watch it
Unfold
Dont expose it
If Im folding large bills
Its not as valuable to me as the riches of the soul
Im lyrically intense as the vision
Of men and women
Scattering in the middle of an evacuation from villages
This is that instant vintage lyricism
Intended to get you lifted
Essentially your mental is targeted
Autistic expression
Is manifesting your limits
But not in my psyche
Thats why I cant be involved with it
All energy Im around is selected
Authentic
And genuine
Cause a lot of them would like to see you fall
So I
Lay low get dough control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Yeeah
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight
Yeeah
I never needed the gold or the diamond
Bagging more than my family
Man getting older
I find it aint important
To dazzle and impress thoughts
In the minds of strangers
Who wouldnt throw me a preserver if my life was in danger
Fuck it
Lay in the cut as these days are numbered
Some say that whats up is simply abundance of life
Im about to reup my spirit today
And come with the verbal ingredients
To intoxicate your circumference
Operate at a speed or capacity thats not among us
Some will hate us
They are afraid of potential greatness coming through you
Later for that I could never stay in your dumbness
The game youre playing is sad and your energy may get selfdestructive
I thought your front
Thats why you stepped to the other side of the street
While youre crying looping and sighing
I kept on hustling
Not just for green but for any freedom of being me
Im forever shaking your opinions
And weak assumptions Buster
Lay low get dough control money
And keep it out of the spotlight
Yeeah
Live life and shine your light but
Just you stay away from the spotlight

The friends I would follow was crack babies and hustlers
Its steel sharpen steel in the block made me a cutler
My pen is from the future like Octavia Butler Wlcome to America oh 
My grandmother suturd a flag from bloody cotton
The fruits of her labor alas already rotten Welcome to America yeah ayy 
My man said Yo its crazy how fast that weve forgotten
That we used to pull boxes and plows like we were oxen
And cows without an option and now its this glorious
Victorious story only pitched
For me to shut it down they sold some of us down the rivers
Its such a poor level of thought I get the shivers
Its insidious and its always been hideous
I had to tread water and run be amphibious
They do you so dirty for one yo whats cleanliness
They make you wanna let off a gun into the emptiness like
Preach now lover preach now lover
That we runnin runnin runnin runnin runnin

The universe my university Im educated
This one is for my very revolutionaries
After keeping it a hundred even though the truth is heavy
Who stand firmly and see their life is a journey
That either God or the gurney my public defender burned me
So did the district attorney in a turbulent trial
They told me that time is master well Im serving it now

Tomorrow may not come at least my soul felt this love Uh 
If I let you go at least my soul felt this love
Hey now hang now hey now hang now
Now a Black soul never passes alone
If its blood spilled on the ancestors ashes and bone
From a pure heart the Lord fashioned after His own
Went packaged and flown to the essence of his African throne
For every lost body crossed tarred feathered and tossed
Its no way I could measure the course or ever exhaust
But whether its yours or mine this American cloth
Has never been soft while history was running its course
I ran hard from Jamestown with slaves found Jesus
And foul demons that never be charged with malfeasance
I sat through they revival though I never found credence
I found that we had never known shit about freedom
Ive been charged with treason Ive been scarred and freezin
Ive been called a nigga and then called a heathen

7838,"Real Niggaz LP Version Lyrics
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo you shouldve covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause yous a sucker
Bend ya ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Dont try to hang you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up you ass youll get hemorrhoids
Because if you try to fuck wit Ren
Ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting a size 10
First come first serve whoevers got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hiphop maniac
Brainiac so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think that rap would last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo be original your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums of so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and not beating the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo giving what I gotta give doing what I gotta do
You dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
You cant harm me alarm me
Cause were the generals in this fucking hiphop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didnt know
We blow flow and getting loose slow from the get go yo
Titles are takin
Yo fuck this shit Yella kick the break in
Its the real thing
You are now
Real real niggas niggas
You can run but you cant hide you know Im a find ya
Cause a nigga like Rens only two steps behind ya
Dont look back cause youre shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on forget that the mics on
Dont step on my muthafucking stage without Nikes on
Dont say its psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I get the right flow
All these niggas with the jibber jabber
But couldnt kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because yo its the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But Im a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead
Back the good the bad the ugly you see
A little streetwise nigga you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
With that hardcore hiphop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get
Trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

EazyE a nigga thats real
Real niggas straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked its my bullet you caught
So if youre talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats
They played out thats what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we aint happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
Yet so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record come Ill come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money dont buy you a fucking crumb
Youre on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
Because if I let you slide its just cause you lucked up
Dont come in my face again because Im a floor ya
And if youre a bitch Im a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitudes a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas
Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness but Dre is just a nigga that glad its
Sucka muthafuckas like you making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When Im expressing stand still like youre full of rigor mortis
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess you figure
You can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
A nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play

So Im glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold

Since day one niggas doubted the Don
Cause I was anon now Terror Squad is a thousand beyond
Not only strong but we loyal and royally treated
Quadriplegic any squad that wanna squabble when Im heated
Not even God can believe it the way we regulate
And levitate heavyweight niggas like they was featherweight
Every day I do the same thing
Its the paid game to amputate more body parts than gangrene
Yo this a mans game its a shame how niggas truly mock me
But who can stop me from breakin niggas off like Fujiyaki
My crews probably the only niggas that really live the lyrics
Niggas really fear us they mustve heard we really killers
Were Philly fillers and 40 guzzlers with millimeters
And army colors Willie niggas that laundry dollars
Im Nostradamus predictin the future my position is crucial
With a nonfiction obsession addiction to shoot ya
Hey yo Im better off dead than givin the feds the satisfaction
Subtracting my freedom have me missin in action
A fraction of yall raw like Colt to the jaw
The rest of yall fear war and couldnt follow out the protocol
Joe the God is like the angel of death strangle your neck
Thats why Don Cartagenas the name you respect
Ill leave a pain in your chest thatll make you question your threshold
Flex like you bench four still bless you like a chest cold
We destined to explode thats why I stay on flip mode
You dick rode me long enough Dunn now you can let go
X2
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im deadly and there aint no gettin rid of me
Uh uh uh yo
Somebody hold me back Joey Cracks about to load the gat
And blow this track to the stars like the zodiac
Hold me back this max n better out for the ass n cheddar
But fast cash dont last forever
I asked the felons if I dont stay wrapped in leathers
And hats with feathers I got all the ostriches acting jealous
Track the trailers in chrome black Cateras
Two hundred inch Mickey Thompsons flown back from Paris
Dat dats the illest these body tracks make a rap killings
Others is trying to stack billions out in crack buildings
My destiny was to shine to climb
Especially in time with the recipe in mind
From the jump start they aint have to pump heart in this
I was a part of this and marvelous stats it wasnt hard to miss
And yo I had to burn cats like arsonists and still continue
Whose on my menu A record deal they couldnt lend you
I had to burn my Glock and earn my spot
The time flew by had to turn my clock
And start with a new resume I run into that bitch named Desree
She aint believe my dream was a better way
Prospectll have to collect dough
Diallin 905 to LAX with somethin I was trying to drive
A life thats trife for what I wore in the fuckin 
A thug in pain I swear to my little cousins grave
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im deadly and there aint no gettin rid of me
Every man in this world has a destiny
Cant no other rapper in this game get the best of me
Unless you just deaf dumb and blind you know the pedigree
Better get ready because Im dead in the middle of little Italy

We say the facts and if they lie
We comin back for them
They might say but they dont know
They say they say 
They dont know
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
Im the black pill in the Matrix the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick Tell Cara get us a show
Little Com I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man aint necessarily the nigga with dough
They say You ripped wow yeah thats what they say
My niggas couldnt tell it was me like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day wit focused crime broads and good wine
They say Dope is sour so its homework and hood crimes
I stood mine for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say tell em J

We comin back for them
They might say but they dont know

Ah the sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask him How do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacay where it aint no channels
But its quite okay for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again
They say Whats happenin
We say the facts and if they lie Uh ha 
We comin back for them
They might say but they dont know
They say they say 
They dont know oh
They say Dude think he righteous
I write just to free minds from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper whether its weed or Isis
They say life is a game so I play hard
Writin for my life cause Im scared of a day job
They say Sef kept the hood together
I tell the young We cant play the hood forever
Play my cards right they say I went too left
They showed me strange love like I was Mr F
Played chess in this game of pawns and knights
Now I claim King like Don or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ
The way I sacrificed and resurrected twice
They say The crochet pants and the sweater was wack
Seen the corner now they say That niggas back uh

6764,"Straight Outta Compton Clean Lyrics
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton its a crazy brotha named Ice Cube
From the stupiddope gang wit a attitude
When Im called off I gotta sawedoff
Kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you get with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off yo back thats how Im going out
For the sucka dumb brothas thats showing out
Some start to mumble they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Going off on everybody like that
With bass thats droppin in your face
So give it up smooth
Aint no telling when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep you dancing
With a crime record like Charles Manson
Yo Dre whats the sound of my tool
Now you know that Im about to act a fool
Me you can go toe to toe no maybe
Im knocking suckas out the box daily
Yo weekly monthly and yearly
Until the whole damn world see clearly
That Im down with the capital CPT
Boy you cant step to me
So when Im in your neighborhood you better duck down
Cause Ice Cube will damn sure buck em down
As I leave believe Im stomping
But when I come back boy Im coming straight outta Compton
Yo Ren
Whassup
Tell em where you from
Straight outta Compton a brotha with his finger on the trigger
More punks I take out my rep gets bigger
Im a ruthless villain and you know this
But the suckas in the public wont show this
But I dont really care Imma make my snaps
If not from the records from jacking the craps
Its like burglary the definition is jacking
And when illegally armed its called packing
Knock a fool out in a sec
I find somebody talkin trash and put em in check
So if youre at a show in the front row
Imma call you a sucka if you dont go with the flow
Youll probably get mad like a punk is supposed to
But that shows me yo youre composed to
A crazy young brotha from the street
Attitude legit cause Im ready to hit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any fool in my way that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and thats a law
REN spells Ren but Im raw
See cause people know me as a villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killing
Thats taking place without a clue
And once youre on the scope you know youre through
Look you might take it as a trip
But a brotha like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother thatll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous young brotha raising hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont really care thats the problem
When I see a police I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see the punk pass I smile
To me its kinda funny the attitude showing suckas driving
But dont know where the hell they going just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless
Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see Ill get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and now Im jetting
And leave a memory no onell be forgetting
So what about the girl who got shot 
You think I give a damn about a girl I aint a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E
And if you ever mess with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the mother yeah
Straight outta Compton
Thats the way it goes in the city of Compton boy

Found out the man Id die for
He wasnt even concerned
I tried and I tried and I tried
To keep him in my life to keep him in my life

But how could this be love

1085,"Back in the USA LyricsOh well oh well I feel so good today
We just touched ground on an international runway
Jet propelled back home from over seas to the USA
New York Los Angeles oh how I yearned for you
Detroit Chicago Chattanooga Baton Rouge

Welcome to DBlock city of broke down dreams
Where things aint always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers killers pimps pushers
Panhandlers hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun dont shine here in this part of town
But we all got a town thats similar to this too
They say every citys got a ghetto every ghettos got a hood
Take a good look around you cause theres a DBlock near you
Place where aint nobody that proud its a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Working around though cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
Five minutes flat the whole town know
Lotta assuming a niggas salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a bodys technicality
Other than that catch em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We dont play with the lizards we make phrases up and say em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you wont even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You wont even see that ride pulling up alongside you
Youll be shot fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
DBlock the place where OGs get knocked locked up
Get out come home for a week and get reknocked
You wont even see cops hiphop police dont even stop
On DBlock where everybody wants to be Pac
And you can get popped over the new GUnit Reeboks

Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes

Just throw it in the bag bag 
You know we had to go shopping one more time right
I think we forget somethin haha haha
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
I said if you gettin money if you gettin money
If you gettin money just throw it in the bag
Its Mr Throw It In The Bag I just throw it in the bag
I dont know how much it cost but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I aint know it had a tag
Im no liar I dont front Im a buy her what she want
Cause your queen posed to get what she desire what she want
If my lady like to eat then Im a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this green she the fire to my blunt
You can try her if you want bet its gon cost you
Bags with the Gs jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga aint ya nigga unless he endorse you
They sayin it aint trickin if you got it they lyin
I say it aint trickin if you got her she mine
You niggas aint got to worry bout her she fine
My Player Cards approved you niggas declined NICEEE
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe

Well alright

Uh uh we up in Barneys goin dumb again
Every time we leave the manager say come again
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back I make her feel young again
If her card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They dont give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him tell me thats her baby
I hope that I never meet him that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah she say she lucky that she his
No Im lucky that you mine baby you know what it isssss
Yall know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes

Got no need she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes

Allallallallallall we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag bag 
Shorty so nice I dont mean polite
When I say nice I mean lookin right
And you cant put a price on something lookin right
If they ask how much tell em what its lookin like
Everything I buy fly its like Im bookin flights
If I want it Im a get it that should not be tooken light
And thats on everything I got a crazy lady
So Money Aint A Thang JayZ JD
Like JayZs lady its Beyoncein
Supportin your women goes beyond payin
Watchin me ball is like LeBRON playin
Im in the Louie shoes you might see KanYe in
They sayin it aint trickin if you got it they lyin
I say it aint trickin if you got her she mine
You niggas aint got to worry bout her she fine

You should never in your wildest dreams shit on a nigga
Police eat a dick straight up you know why
Clap clap on clap off
Clap at them and I do not mean applause Nah 
Rap nicer than Santa with no Claus
Track twice as bananas with no chorus
Uh yeah its suicide murder
In the hood like catalytic converters
On the block like Lego in the streets like street light
Three Little Pigs is what I be on these beats like
In other words the police say it say it like Pac the police
Fuck em and thats straight from the underground
Where little kids got it bad cause we brown
Now who am I PMonch from Do or Die
Nah South Suicide Queens where I get down
I peep surveillance in the street every summer
You may not play lotto but you know these numbers
The 105th the 103rd
My peoples in Queens doing 13 if we get the urge
To get on some Todd Scott shit my brains a Glock clip
My lames be on some 1800COPSHOT shit
Say we were gonna say we were gonna get it together
Yeah yeah yeah
One day one day one day one day one day
I said the people gon clap
Watch me clap to this
We went from niggas to porch monkeys to negroes to blacks
Back to niggas again yet niggas is still hungry
Abolish the Nword the plans so corny
While Homeland Security cams are all on me
They watch through the fiber optics it dawned on me
That cops can just run in your spot quick without warning
They educate the masses to follow its so boring
I sat in the back of the class asleep snoring
And they ask me why Im vocal and adamant
Cause I lost my focus like Governor Patterson
And the ghetto is impossible to escape
And the first obstacle is this tapeworm in my abdomen
Spearchucker fuck that I toss javelins
And fivethousand dollar bills in the face of James Madison
This is an American postmortem
To focus on you bogus Novus Ordo Seclorum clap
Say we were gonna say we were gonna get it together
Yeah yeah yeah
One day one day one day one day one day
I said the people gon clap
Watch me clap to this
Now everybody watch me clap
No respect no manners its Mad Max with multiple macs
Mad banana clips and a black hammer
That hits the back of a black talon
A slew of hollow tips through the wall of your blue silence
And selective theatrics collective dramatics
Im systematically pissed clap automatics for Mumia Abu Jamal
Maybe Im Crispus Attucks
Ps a fanatic for peace but you angered a pacifist
The Gospel I spit it like Jesus of Nazareth then emphatically clap
At any obstacle an impossible feat the fathom is not logical
But chronicle the thought of the people
Cause one day we gon clap

Were just some niggas whore on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic right 
For all my Doggs keepin yall in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause its cool when you cause the cozy condition in
Which we create cause thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 oclock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said Um mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top dog of them all
There was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true Thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my allblue Chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my Indo
Then I dilly dally I ran through a alley 
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley 
This was a girl playing hard to get
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said um
Its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Damn now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break it up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
And so I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying Why dont you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay

And on and on and on she kept goin
The bitch been around before my mothers born
I said Cheer up and I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin
I says Im 19 she says Stop lyin
I says I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover

Five years older than I
He was my brother
Twentythree years old the day he died

They cursed my brother to his face

An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong

Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Ive been thinking bout Ive been thinking bout
Ive been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love feel I need another dose
I know its a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice where did the king go wrong
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls I need your warm
The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so Im a keep dreaming on
Its kind of like The Breakup with Jen and Vince Vaughn
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
They say you dont know know know what you got
Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such yo a lot but the feelings not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasnt able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess its only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you
Once the love was strong
Now its long long gone
Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
Cause I want you cause I want you
I want you I want you
The Chicago Kansas concert in Boston has been changed to the Kansas Boston concert in Chicago

Niggas poppin pills sippin barre smoking fry and God knows whatever else
Niggas on that Malcolm X
You know like that nigga Breeze said man the hood gonna catch up with you man
You know what Im saying
Peep up in the city with the hoes showing ass and titties
Im a ghetto star and the games a pity
Cause most niggas get took by the street fame
And they cant hold on to their spot in this dirty game
I see a lot of niggas sign record deals
But they fall off cause they niggas wasnt real
But Ive been in this thang since 92
Getting my money doing what the hustlas do
Through the wars having no cars
Going to jail rapping behind bars
Putting it down wit Bun B
When we was broke out on the streets
Trying to come up on a motha fucking Swisher Sweet
I used to sell weed then I sold crack
I used to ride in a oldschool gold llac
Fleetwood wit cherry lights
I sold that bitch to that boy Mo thats why we come down at night
Slow down know what Im talking bout repeated

And spend big money with my motha fucking hustling friends

You need to slow down before somebody fuck you up
You need to slow down before it comes to get you
Hit you in your wig and aint nothing to split you
Slow down know what Im talking bout repeated
You see this rap game is more than just rhymes and beats
It designed to make money it starts in the streets
A lotta niggas dont follow the rules and end up losing
Way before their time cause their records aint moving
Better slow down and rethink your strategy nigga
Have you still paying dues you cant be mad at me nigga
I aint looking for no handouts or looking for no friends unuh 
My brother always told me nigga go and get your ends
And thats what Im a do its the honesttoGod truth

But when I look in the mirror I see sexy ass me

Hopin that I dont get cut by these police
Makin raids on those of us who know whats up

Got them keys and they got them drums
Making superstitious runs on them insufficient funds

How the hell you robbers gonna rob the robber

I dont wanna smile for the camera damn I just wanna see my fam rise
I can feel when a man lies tryin to grow old and wise
And Im still fly like airlines stay sharp like samurais
Dip low like Camron Big Show when its slam time

Bogarting through this door
Hopin that it dont get shut
By these police makin raids on those of us who know whats up

And all gold in the bones
Hit the strip club

But I dont give em a sip

Or are you selling your baby a dream
Am I who you thinkin of who you thinkin of 
Hey lover boy am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
Am I a sucker for love a sucker for love 
Damn Im trippin cause I never really felt like this
To me women used to be only fuck foxes
But its like with you I cherish every kiss
I know its a risk but you make me wanna come clean
I wanna make you my queen
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams
Only for your love I fiend
Cause the way you put it on me make me wanna scream
And fuck you in places you aint never seen
Like a private boat as we float down stream
Yeah I already know you done heard this before
But the way you make me feel is real
Playas dont love no hoes but stayin true like you do
Got me head over heels so tell me whats the deal baby
Cause you lookin too fine to not be mine
And I aint gon never be satisfied
Unless youre on my side to the end of time
I can tell you think Im lying
But I swear to you girl this aint no scheme
You stay on my mind even in my sleep
You keep a nigga havin wet dreams on the real
Hey lover am I the only one

From the first time I met ya you was on my mind all night
A Maybelene queen with a body too tight
Wearin black and white in some brand new Mikes
Draped in ice attitude nice
You the type of woman that I need in my life
To add a little spice cook a nigga steak and rice
I can see us one day man and wife
Walkin down the aisle havin our first child
Plus a marriage worth while
With a brand new lifestyle I could walk that mile
But baby I need you right now
In my arms caressin me
I can see your eyes undressing me
Girl its destiny and love is the recipe
But this ways got the best of me
On everything I can guarantee you better things
If you just get rid of whats his name
And let me in your world
So I can show you baby that my love is real and not a game
So can a brother come through
So I can show you boo just exactly what I mean
It dont matter if you fuck me tonight or next month
Bae only time can reveal a dream

But it seems like Ive been knowin you all my life

In the city no hear my pretty Go
Quick to break a fifty for put you on my video
Young and witty ho the only fe I feelin pretty for
I dont know what I was frontin on
But I dont see nothin wrong sprung or gone
My every heartbeats weaker follow the leader
I promise I wont hurt you baby
Dont feel the heatseaker cause we gon be smokin on sweet cheeba
Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall
Get you the finest things like diamond rings
Even though my mind is strange Im tryin to change
How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me grind the pain
No lyin no games you gon give me some hey now we freakin up in the cut
Cause I just sold you a dream ho like ya girlie did to my homie

5469,"Letter to BIG Lyrics
Uh huh I aint even good with writing
I dont even write shit
I just felt I had to write this letter to BIG
Niggas is acting like Letter to BIG
Uh yo
Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace
Yeah its your boy Kiss I just want to holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack a fresh pair of Wallies
You know Im still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybodys the king now
You aint gotta be nice getting shot is the thing now
Mafia was doing their best they separated
Now Roc and Gutta doing a stretch uh yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I aint heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper rappers is more commercially successful now
But the hearts a lot weaker
You know me still got the flow thatll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
Its easy BIG all you need is a protool set
And I aint touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody thats somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that Just a matter of time matter of time 
Im an impeccable lyricist
And with the right mechanics I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I aint on the label no more but Im tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know Im nice fuck it Im my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But they could never ever duplicate your swag Never 
Meanwhile Im a keep it so on my lil plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil mans
Up there stepping with God
And down here Mister Cee in BK still repping you hard
Tyanna so pretty CJ turned into a Lil Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments he keep me the flyest
Tonight Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limon to the head
And before I end it I gotta say thanks
Cause not only was your time wellspent it was splendid thanks 
Miss you my nigga
One Love So we tried to hard to understand 
So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away
That was my letter to BIG nahmean 
You were everything you were everything
I felt it was only right I really smoked with them niggas 
So well just keep our heads to the sky Drink wit em 
Sat wit em talked wit em 
Cause we know were gonna see you in the next lifetime Real shit 
But its never easy saying goodbye
See you when I get there Biggie 
Saying goodbye Love you 
So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away
You were everything Why you had to go away 
So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away
You were everything Oooohooooooohooooooohoooo 
",got my own plan handle mine like a grown man Long as I know Im nice fuck it Im my own fan Remixed the joints you had But they could never ever duplicate your swag Never Meanwhile Im a keep it so on my lil plans And you might bump into a few of my lil mans Up there stepping with God And down here Mister Cee in BK still repping you hard Tyanna so pretty CJ turned into a Lil Biggie Just a little lighter but so witty On your born day we get the highest Groovy still the best with the garments he keep me the flyest Tonight Patron is dead Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limon to the head And before I end it I gotta say thanks Cause not only was your time wellspent it was splendid thanks Miss you my nigga One Love So we tried to hard to understand So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away That was my letter to BIG nahmean You were everything you were everything I felt it was only right I really smoked with them niggas So well just keep our heads to the sky Drink wit em Sat wit em talked wit em Cause we know were gonna see you in the next lifetime Real shit But its never easy saying goodbye See you when I get there Biggie Saying goodbye Love you So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away You were everything Why you had to go away So we tried to hard to understand why you had to go away You were everything Oooohooooooohooooooohoooo,Letter to BIG Lyrics Uh huh I aint even good with writing I dont even write shit I just felt I had to write this letter to BIG Niggas is acting like Letter to BIG Uh yo Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace Yeah its your boy Kiss I just want to holla In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet Kangol on the rack a fresh pair of Wallies You know Im still the liquor and the weed child And still got Branson on speed dial And everybodys the king now You aint gotta be nice getting shot is the thing now Mafia was doing their best they separated Now Roc and Gutta doing a stretch uh yeah Kim is still in it to win it I seen Money L awhile ago but I aint heard from Cease in a minute People in power is queer I could go on for a year bout how it would be if you were still here The game got cheaper rappers is more commercially successful now But the hearts a lot weaker You know me still got the flow thatll pop speakers First option on offense the top feature Its easy BIG all you need is a protool set And I aint touch the paper that I was supposed to yet Everybody thats somebody show respect Only a matter of time before they notice that Just a matter of time matter of time Im an impeccable lyricist And with the right mechanics I could take over be clear of this They well aware of Kiss the light of the city And I aint on the label no more but Im tighter with Diddy I
3852,"Wont be giving up
In this world where everything aint enough
And everything is a must I remind you all
Its easy to get caught in the rush
You weak shitll blind you dawg
Too many trying to fit in
Still Id rather stand out
No better way of living
Rocky lucky link on my neck cant letem see you sweat
The illest shit aint thinking to me dawg I aint even slept
All nonbelievers check
King round for round the crown aint leave me yet
Been cropped the sound look at my CD set
A set of Cubans on my leather spooning
Settle down some shit Im never doing
Drop and find eleven new ones
Compliments of better schooling
Im skipping continents for better viewing
Came into prominence forever ruling
You knew the life I live youd judge your own
Roaming like I left something still the man when Im home
I hope Heaven got a club
I done climbed into all kind of pussy never fell in love
Success no better drug and the pressure just a plus
Moving on you never take the life in us
Nigga take a loss where every mistake will cost
Color stain the floors
Aint not sympathy this pain is yours
Lets toast to this paper new toast for the haters
Im bred to be what you want Game dead giving it hope
Realest nigga the more I think about it
My head high I keep a mink around
Throw a nigga off even they even think you doubt it
All I got is fire Need an 8 alarm attire
Easy to admire sixteen will take an overnighter
Take advantage nothing is needed All is forgiven
Too long pretending then smoke what you call driven
Im drunk to where you see double
Been around hear the street crumble
Chain still swing like free couples
Fear being fucked up frustrated trying to function
The ghetto took all my close friends
Somebody owes us something for real
They cant catch the God wrecking in my repertoire
Extra fog aint no body close Im ghost
My anxiety over flows Flow with a cold steal
Leaving a trail of road kill and still wont chill ill

4895,"Shes Not Just Another Woman Monique Lyrics
I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
Whether PS46 or 151
After school Id go to her house to have some fun
We both lived in Colonial Projects
I lived in building 48 she lived in building 26
We used to play Ringling Coke or 123
But when Im in Moniques presence I would just freeze
The relationship began when I was five startin
She was in nursery school I was in kindergarten
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
When wed go trick or treating I would carry her bag
When we moved to Long Island it was all such a drag
Cause I know it would be difficult to see her again
I wouldnt miss her more than Id miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
And this is what I say to my love Monique because
Shes not just another woman
Shes not no no
Let me tell ya a little somethin about Monique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
I remember when we used to go trick or treatin
I used to snatch bags so she could sink her teeth in
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and
Leenette the girl she called her cousin
We never had an argument oh we was never fussin
Thats why me and her got along so good
Anything I asked her to do you know she would
We would have family day in back of building 70
I would win her a prize so she could treat me heavenly
I dont care what nobody say because
This girl would make my day and
Now this is the epilogue of this story
About a young little girl especially for me
No matter how many years ago I cant forget
But then again 1986 hit
She looked just the same but in a bigger version
My mind started goin on a love excursion
I started reminiscin to her bout old times
She began to smile I guess I rang her chimes
I didnt see her again until 1988
And I saw her again and she still was straight
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
I told her would you be with me and what would occur
Then I asked was she swingin any capers
She said no not me nobody got no papers
I couldnt believe after all of these years
I was so happy she waited it brought me to tears cause
quickly fades out

4172,"Sad Songs Say So Much Lyrics
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And its times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know
Turn em on turn em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone ah 
Why dont you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room oh
Just feel their gentle touch gentle touch 
When all hope is gone ooh 
Sad songs say so much
If someone else is sufferin enough oh to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then its easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues
So turn em on turn em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone ah 
Why dont you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room oh
Just feel their gentle touch gentle touch 
When all hope is gone ooh

Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap and starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybodys after all of my ends
Get yo hand out my pocket 
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays Im losing all of my friends let the story begin
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Yeah
Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When Im at the crib Im mad Im not at the club lit
When Im at the club Im mad Im not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes Id rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name Luda 
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what Im really saying is
The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high

Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade Give me my Ac 
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin I wasnt underground
Got underground start trippin I need hits We outta here 
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbors fertilizer is fake Dont let it fool ya 
We always searching for what we never had
Always ignoring whats in front of our face
Weve been conditioned to think

Was living in awholenother State all help
He received he believed was the way God dealt
With his life but some would consider it trife
The ignorant type caught up in all the biblical hype
He wasnt feeling it right
Time told he would let the blind old man in the mirror give him advice
Sincere he kept his friends near with Devotion
They hang in a neighbourhood gang called Emotion
Who wasnt usually good for this community but
He knew of The Danger he grew up with Anger
He wasnt worried thought they was the best for him
If he wanted anything Lust was there for him
Sex Money Power Love would let him care for them
Hatred was the strongest he protected them
From a Truth he considered Evil hear no see no
His profile dont smile you know how Ego 
Conscience told Soul how to go legit
He said You know Doubt He told me dont believe that shit
Thats when he hooked up with Jealousy and Envy
Scoping out this Benzy rolling spokes about twenty
Pulled out the driver who now wanted to fight him
Fear told him You the man Pull the heat out and fire
This is how he living how he feeling hardcore
What he do that for Mr Greed said More
Remind me of a cat named Influence
Been proven to make men do it just like a sin student
Now Conscience had a question Whos your biggest enemy
He didnt know Shame so he blamed it on Hennessey
Reality wrote him a cheque and let him have it
But they jumped in the ride Pride wouldnt let him cash it
He crashed it
Hook x3
The Evil of Self
Everyday its the battle with the Self few are victorious
Many fall victim of wanting to be vainglorious
The Evil of Self is what drives you into destruction
Kids caught up in crack calling full of corruption
The youth need encouragement Evil of Self
Dont wanna hear about selfevaluation or development
Fall victim of the negative extravagant and competitive
And all kinds of irrelevance we blame it on environment
The Evil of Self causing destruction of his family
Jealousy and greed are poison in places of society
The Evil of Self the justification for foolishness
Its sad any form of ignorance we grew immune to it
The Evil of Self dont wanna hear constructive criticism
People get a sense of arrogance when somethings given to em
Surrounded by devils I find myself performing exorcisms
Worlds got us going in circles chasing materialism
The Evil of Self is what plunges you into error
AlHamdulillah but most worship the mighty dollar
The Devil blinds us with the love of money and power
The Evil of Self the content is the soulseller
The backbiter the slanderer the instigator
The divided conquerors that established the legislator
The player hater the fornicator sooth sayer
Selling you stories but they sold their soul Shaytan became the regulator
Idolaters violators and hardheads
Women thats fine thats selling bodies to bad men
Most men are in jail due to women and drugs
Everybodys on life support pulling their plugs
Inordinate love the Evil of Self your worst enemy
The different classes of people claiming superiority
The battle that discourage many from wanting to strive
Against the Evil of Self viewers discretion is advised

8014,"Ahhhh yeaaaaaaaaah
Eightball MJG in the muthafuckin house
And we came here today to talk to you about this thing called pimpin
It has been misunderstood over the years
So now we have come to set the record straight
Niggas dont do this shit right
It takes a special kind of nigga
You know what Im sayin
Yeah
It takes a nigga thats hard from the start you gotta have heart
To meet a bitch mack her down then rip her apart
Its all in the game a nigga cant change
If you dont break a bitch then your game is lame mayne
See Im from Tennessee with curls and gold teeth
So everywhere I go bitches strike up conversations wit me
About the way I talk about the way I dress
About how my gold teeth look so fresh
See how I bait em in soon as a nigga speak
That deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
Im in my Cadillac chillin like a fat mack
Smoking on a fat sack drinkin on a pint of gnac
I pick up my car phone cause the freak beeped
Its my nigga baby mama but sometimes I creep
Thats just the way it is niggas have to take a chance
When you aint around anybody could be in that ass
But Im just a young nigga tryna make a dollar
And they way I live to some its hard to swallow
See livin down south aint what you think it be
Nine times out of ten niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah thats right
We trying to teach all these lames you know
How to do this shit
Cause its really a hard job
But them lame niggas
They make me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Now let me explain a pimp a nigga about the MONEY
See a ho break a ho
And try to influence the bitch to turn a trick for the nigga who
Persuaded her to sell ass like hoes supposed to
Now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
Surrounded by all these hoes thats goin and givin me money
Its funny how a ho can make you think she wit ya
When all the time shes just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
Take care of your business bring me the money
Yeah this shit is thick
Ho dont violate bitch you know I taught you better
Take all his cash grab on his ass write that trick a love letter
Train your woman to break a manman meaning another nigga
Just some shit in the game same ol same to make your pimpin thicker
Slicker the pimpin gets freakier gets the bitch
MJG is rich Im coocoo for these tricks
I pimp
Yeah thats right baby I pimp
So uh what you need to do you need to sit dat ass there
And uh right about now Im bout to fire up one of these spliffs
And get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah shit so high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Part 2 its all the same G
Trying to school fools on this PIMP
Lesson one First you should pull a bitch fuck her good
Next time tell her no the next time take her dough
Oh you better watch your back too mayne
Cause theres a lot of bitches in the world wit much game
Lesson two Watch that ho dont trust her wit none of yo dough
Never let a bitch know how you make your cash flow
Lesson three If you dont tell that ho who is boss
Bitches like to run shit but end up getting smacked in the mouth
See a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
Push her head into the wall til you hear that crackin sound
Drown in the tub rubadubdub
Some niggas get pussywhupped and fall into a love bugs
Buying hoes this buying hoes that
Then bragging to your friends how you fucked her from back
Never how you took they cash never how you beat they ass
Never how you pull hoes fuck em then drop em fast
I dont understand your plan at all man
But you should be around niggas like me
Pimps
Yeah man these niggas a trip you know what Im sayin
But niggas like me I have to smoke them spliffs
To get my mind off that shit
And when I smoke em I get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
You know I stay high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Wherever there is a ho theres bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can tempt
A sucker will spend his money til he aint got nothin left
Instead of blaming the bitch he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldnt be a ho if it wasnt for the tricks
But I suggest we keep em so a pimp can keep his bitch
It need to be understood there wouldnt be one without the other
So why in the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
Jealous sucker just maaaaad
They cant hang with the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimps game
How in the fuck do you figure that pimpin is dead when nigga you know its alive
Pimpin is misunderstood by those who cant thats why they said it died
Others tried pimpin but was only makin chump change
One track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
Rearrange shit that they done seen in a movie script
Damn aint that a bitch niggas like me
Pimp
MJfuckinG PIMP
Staying down on this pimpin bout these hoes
But some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
And that shit just makes me get so high
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
Ah yeah I get so fuckin high 
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just cant seem to get my feet on the ground

7116,"My radio believe me I like it loud
Im the man with the box that can rock the crowd
Walkin down the street to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
Im sorry if you cant understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Dont mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past 10
My story is rough my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold and Im out to crush
My name is Cool J I devastate the show
But I couldnt survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radios bad from the Boulevard
Im a hiphop gangster and my name is Todd
Just stimulated by the beat bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it wont rewind
Cause I play every day even on the subway
I woulda got a summons but I ran away
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
But I know I cant live without my radio
Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really dont care if youre jealous or not
Cause I make the songs you sing along
And your radios def when my records on
So get off the wall become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radios loud like a fire alarm
The floor vibrates the walls cave in
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin
Def sounds in my ride yes the front and back
You would think it was a party not a Cadillac
Cause I drive up to the ave with the windows closed
And my bass is so loud it could rip your clothes
My stereos thumpin like a savage beast
The level on my power meter will not decrease
Suckas get mad cause the girlies scream
And Im still gettin paid while you look at me mean
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
But I know I cant live without my radio
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
And I know I cant live without my radio
Dont touch that dial Ill be upset
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck
Cause the radios thumpin when Im down to play
Im the royal chief rocker LL Cool J
Let your big butt bounce from right to left
Cause its a actual fact this jam is def
Most definitely created by me
Goin down in radio history
Im good to go on your radio
And Im cold gettin paid cause Rick said so
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to diss
But its nothin ya frontin ya girl I am stuntin
And my radios loud enough to keep you gruntin
My name is Cool J Im from the Rock
Circulating through your radio nonstop
Im lookin at the wires behind the cassette
And now Im on the right standing on the eject
Wearin light blue Pumas a whole lotta gold
And jams like these keep me in control
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go
And I know I cant live without my radio
Your energy level starts to increase
As my big beat is slowly released
Im on the radio and at the jam
LL Cool J is who I am
Ima make ya dance boogie down and rock
And youll scratch and shake to my musical plot
And to expand my musical plan
Cut Creator rock the beat with your hands
Thats right so dont try to front the move
As you become motivated by the funky groove
You can see me and Earl chillin on the block
With my box cold kickin with the gangster rock
See people cant stop me neither can the police
Im a musical maniac to say the least
For you and your radio I made this for
Cool Js here to devastate once more
Pullin all the girls takin out MCs
If ya try to disrespect me I just say Please

1906,"KawLiga was a wooden Indian standing by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
KawLiga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday hed talk
KawLiga too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart is made of knotty pine
Poor old KawLiga he never got a kiss
Poor old KawLiga he dont know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red
KawLiga that poor old wooden head
KawLiga was a lonely Indian never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair
KawLiga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no
And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh so far away but old KawLiga stayed
KawLiga just stands there as lonely as can be
And wishes he was still an old pine tree
Poor old KawLiga he never got a kiss
Poor old KawLiga he dont know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red
KawLiga that poor old wooden head

When you fear nobody wants to know you
You need hands to brush away the tears
When you hold the brand new baby
You need tender hands to guide them all the way
You need hands to thank the Lord for living
And forgiving us this day
You need hands to show the world youre happy
And you need hands when you have to stop the bus
But the hands that we love so dear
Are the hands that we love to hear
Are the hands that You give to us
Everybody holds the hands that You give to us

5271,"Rest in Peace
Heres another warriors song rep this life to the fullest
Rest in Peace
Mothafucka say yo prayers
For brothers who died from blackonblack violence
Rest in Peace
You aint payin respect when you spose to
Rep this life to the fullest
Rest in Peace
This aint for yall this a toast to them
Rest in Peace
Heres a toast to the dead
If you dont drink smoke to the head
For the freedom fighters killed by the feds
For those who died hard in the streets soakin in red
And died slow asleep in a dream chokin in bed
Heres a toast to the dead for my enemies that are gone
Im not a coward so celebratin that would be wrong
I pray to God that your soul will come back again
So I can see you in the next life and finish it then
A toast to the dead for criminals burnin in Hell
I wonder how many presidents are burnin as well
Emperors popes senators generals
Amputees feel unlucky until they see the vegetables
A toast to the dead for those who are forgotten
Written out of history by the corrupted and rotten
Black saints whitewashed during La Reconquista
Thousands of Indios Spaniards used to conquer the Incas
Fuck a moment of silence I need a moment of violence
Like the 19th century Caribbean islands
Long live those who came before that paved the way for me
The warriors and scientists that came before slavery
And if that last lyric was predictable
Take your clairvoyance and apply it to life in the physical
Presumptuous halfhearted homunculus
Selfdestruction is the power without knowin what the function is
Heres a toast to the dead for all of my fam
I will never let an idea die with a man
My rhymes are like Nazca lines designed to give a view of this
J Dillas still alive as long as his music is
A toast to the dead for rap legends and pioneers
Your legacy wont be forsaken as long as I am here
Knowledge of the past and wisdom of the present
Ill teach and leave in the hands of a worthy lieutenant
A toast to the dead for children with cancer and AIDS
A cure exists and you probably could have been saved
Sad to see medicine divorce morality
Corporate homewreckers pimpin up the salary
A toast to the dead for those thatll die today
The victims and those exonerated by DNA
The only thing worse than givin freedom to the guilty
Is killin the innocent and leavin your soul filthy
Immortal Technique remember me when Im gone
I encrypted my lyrics to stay alive in a song
So youll always keep a piece of my spirit inside
When you struggle to complete what I started before I died
But some of you wont survive the changes the Earth makes
Swallowed by tsunamis hurricanes and earthquakes
And thats just the first stage if you cannot reverse ways
And realize that we are one regardless of our birthplace
My last toast to the dead is for the listener
Human being or extraterrestrial visitor
Remember us for more than our primitive ways
When you study us long after the end of our days

What can you do when your dreams come true
And its not quite like you planned

So you keep on singing for the sake of the song

4400,"One soft infested summer
Me and Terry became friends
Trying in vain to breathe
The fire we was born in
Catching rides to the outskirts
Tying faith between our teeth
Sleeping in that old abandoned beach house
Getting wasted in the heat
And
Hiding on the backstreets
Hiding on the backstreets
With a love so hard and filled with defeat
Running for our lives at night on them backstreets
Slow dancing in the dark
On the beach at Stocktons Wing
Where desperate lovers park
We sat with the last of the Duke Street Kings
Huddled in our cars
Waiting for the bells that ring
In the deep heart of the night
We let loose of everything
To go
Running on the backstreets
Running on the backstreets
Terry you swore wed live forever
Taking it on them backstreets together
Yeah
Endless juke joints and Valentino drag
Where dancers scraped the tears
Up off the street dressed down in rags
Running into the darkness
Some hurt bad some really dying
At night sometimes it seemed
You could hear the whole damn city crying
Blame it on the lies that killed us
Blame it on the truth that ran us down
You can blame it all on me Terry
It dont matter to me now
When the breakdown hit at midnight
There was nothing left to say
But I hated him
And I hated you when you went away
Wa oh wa oh
Laying here in the dark
Youre like an angel on my chest
Just another tramp of hearts
Crying tears of faithlessness
Remember all the movies Terry
Wed go see
Trying to learn to walk like the heroes
We thought we had to be
Well after all this time
To find were just like all the rest
Stranded in the park
And forced to confess

6698,"Like anybody I would like to live a long life longevity has its place
But Im not concerned about that now
I just want to do Gods will
And Hes allowed me to go up to the mountain
And Ive looked over
And Ive seen the Promised Land
I may not get there with you
But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land
So Im happy tonight
Im not worried about anything Im not fearing any man
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at it always follows you where you are
And its hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But its harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically runnin from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South I respect they vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of Americas vision
They want us dancin coonin and hollerin
Only respect us for playin sports and modelin
More than racism its stay in your placeism
More people are trapped in practical blackfaceism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
Its between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Crip niggas Blood niggas eses Asians
Why the fuck we warrin with each others population
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation why the separation
Why we got Jamaicans hatin on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other straight hatin
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness inwhat Im sayin
You gotta recognize another G aint the enemy
When the police ride and kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets we should really end war
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowin the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Tryin to survive cultural assassination
Our hearts were torn apart just like yall was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Every time we called your office you ignored us
Now you holdin hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us ask if were jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of selfdefense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom justice security
But theyre only pure when theyre applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Urgently puttin fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qurans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me my wife and babies we aint never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesnt come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you Civil war

And when he got drunk youd better give him room
Cause hell turn the party out saying

And we down for whatever
And Im down
Solid Pro is down for whatever
The Don Jagwarr is down for whatever
And it dont seem to stop
I dont talk a lot of shit
But when its time to get busy with these hoes lets go
Cause Id rather see a skinhead dead
Then my niggas wearing blue or red
Cause I got the gift
To hit these hoes swift
And Im smelling like a fifth of something
Yeah thats right
Im standing in the store
Koreans act so nice
Cause I got potentials to blow up a Winchells
Donut
And you know what
Im Cool Like Dat like Digable Planets
But dont take a nigga for granted
Cause whether its a verdict or the LA four
You just dont know
That this rappingass nigga will change with the weather

Searching my head for the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes as we said our last goodbyes

5067,"Yo this one aight though
Yo me and Cool V
Dis dis dis gon be dis gon be our new single
And when you hear this story youll say its aight though
Yo yo yo yo Cool V why dont you give me a cue
One more cue and then Im ready to go in
Dont you like when the winters gone
And all of a sudden it starts gettin warm
The trees and the grass start lookin fresh
And the sun and sky be lookin their best
Birds be singin flowers be bloomin
A lot of brand new cars be zoomin
Fly girls lookin the best they can be
And the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see
Besides all that I like the warm weather
Cause thats when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
Cause when I was little we used to go to Coney Island
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
Cause back then it was like fine and dandy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
And your plaid suit jackets they were the shits
The good ol days was back then
And the reason I reminisce cause
Its spring again
Everybody know its spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love
Now girls have you ever broke up with your boyfriend
And you felt that the world was comin to an end
Sittin around the house poutin for no reason
Just because you thought your man was skeezin
For a couple of days look gloomy and gray
Thinkin about the ol happy days
All of a sudden the telephone ring
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
Im tellin you girls keep the man that you got
Cause if he cheats you might need a VD shot
You know two wrongs dont make a right
And if you did somethin wrong dont do the same its not polite
Please dont make this breakin up a trend BECAUSE BECAUSE
Now fellas have you ever met a girl that tried to front
And wanted you to act like you was on a hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
For a girl that always tryin to play hard to get
I know I caught it myself I must admit
And said anything you want you gotta work hard for it
Me the Diabolical be obsessed
And go after somethin that a girl posess
Theyre really on yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
They want drug dealers and fourwheelers
Truck jewelry they expect you to steal her
Sheeeeit I know they must be buggin
They better hit the streets and do their own muggin
But in this case you would just overlook her
Send her on her way and say I cant help you hooker
Cool V scratches to the end

Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin hide your rocks hydraulic
The kid with the most knowledge will obtain and touch top dollars
Hold me down hand me my cake
Dust and bake activate
Fuck your corny debates
Im like cake or maybe like ten thousand dollar rabbits
The kid walked through switch up his accent now Im from Paris
Cash the bill frozen elements in gold
Signs from the most high causes me to break the mold
How the fuck was yall niggas thinkin
You think I fell off the ledge
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead
Never impossible pull out black burners like tonsils
Two Galants hittin if we got to
Bustin at yall niggas daily wall to wall hawkin
Suckin your teeth cause God chaintalkin
Like Ghostface this Ghostface that Ghost sold crack
Now his revelations spoken through rap
Veloured down like the Sheikh of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans Michael Davis its me against housing
Extraordinary problack sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks Apollo rap Frederick Douglass
You know what Aiyo fuck this
Aiyo how can I move the crowd
First of all aint no mistakes allowed
Heres the instructions put it together
Its simple aint it Well quite clever
Marvin Marvin you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin ugh
2Pac Biggie ohhhh how we miss you so
We want yall both to know
We really love you sooo
Aiyo Im Gucci down Wally boots Jamaican hat long 4pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Dont speak much deluxe plush imaginations
Hold a note like Willie Hutch
You mightve bumped into me on the Rikers bus
Weed in my cheeks gem in my beauty sleep sleeve
Dead serious knowledge by 2 triple geese
Come on we juggle mics
Three Card Molly amps advance to the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night Jamaica
Came through in a booger green 68 Pacer
Mad paper high as a fuck truck
Two rappers got stuck that night I aint saying no names
They know who thank you for the chains
Outdoor event New Years Eve Cali weed
30 seconds til we tear and decease
Quick call my seeds dipped in the crowd
The ho spotted me he knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly we exactly
Formed like Christ and his disciples
Black fatigues lethalfaced doonie he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook
Your favorite rappers droppin they drinks
On the low tuckin they links we made eighty off the books
One of the illest since Magic Johnson no disrespect
But metaphorsll keep me out the projects
Rap connectsll keep me correct
Aiyo I wrote this on Donnie roof after his funeral on one knee
Thinkin his killers followin me
So to my nigga Donnie up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here
You got beer weed guns AIDS
All these obstacles its hard to make it nowadays
Whys the Devil winnin Some say its our fault
If thats the answer you know smokin cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin cause thats how they rewind
Yall know how we dine we dont eat swine
And we dont drink wine
If you dont bring me some motherfuckin cognac Ill kill you
I cant feel you aint in my senses and you aint in my dollars
I fuck with rottweilers no leashes no collars brolic scholars
Thats Ghost Deini

Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
Yo jealousy can kill so I test my skill
Any pomp I can romp and stomp at will
Now as I gets my thrill its like my daily drill
You spill raps and invade cause Ive been made to ill
You cant talk the talk you cant walk the walk
Been dwelling with the muggers and the murderers talk
Your shocked by the way I regulate ya obliterate ya
Erase your obsolete weak cheap data
Its this hiphop art I stay true to crack brew to
I fuck your girl a lot better than you do
The type of lyrics I spit will never fail you
Battle you online type a letter forward it then email you
Take you off the track and derail you
Get the hell out my face dont want to be near you
Dont want your snippets hate your album or your headshots
Its ED OG in the blackfitted Red Sox
Thuggin the streets but you soft at home
You got skills off the dome
Im a off your dome
This is a battlefield no time for screaming and yelling
You get smacked in the face use your ice for the swelling
Besides the records Im selling
My momma raised no felon
On the hunt like Helen
For whack rappers whos jellin
This is drama not a kitty show
You want to get fucked up
Like the lowbudget video
I know a lot of times passed
The ED OG is still here and yall still halfass
Yall still half ass
Yall halfass rappers
Still nobody guards I stay sucker free
Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
Its the return of the mouthmusher skullcrusher
Pack myself with two nines and cold crush ya
That nigga all day beating down suckers
Sporting the game making it get more rougher
The facepuncher the hotcruncher
The have it with gods for the law outtoluncher
The seventhirty know Im more than a sick man
The streets raised this wild ass nigga from Murderpan
The real rapper the pimpslapper
The put on the socks with your suit and stay dapper
Whoa the chumpchoker the backwood tree smoker
Stash the gats in the sofa its all over
One life to live and thats that
I keep my lyrics heavily packed and cocked back
Ill smash you right in your fucking face black
Im the realest nigga what you know about that
Im a let my skills shine like brand new chrome
And tell them sonniggas you run with that daddys home
I roll dolo from state to state it feels great
And in two thousand get on the stage and demonstrate
Still nobody guards I stay sucker free
Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
No holds barred Im going all out
I dont think your for real I think your all mouth
So bust one for my dogs locked down
And for my real rap lovers know I got it locked down
Untill your blocked down punks get beat down
You cant rock a party take a seat you clown
I frown upon scavengers and wannabes
Commit atrocities upon MCs who think they heart is mean
Still nobody guards I stay sucker free
Still sling rhymes hard I stay puffing trees
Rollin Dolo from state to state
Still drop the hot shit for you to pull out your crate
Smokey gray Lexus diamond necklace
We livin wreckless and die for these inspectors
The four pounders cock the name on you outoftowners
And what henne filled cups peep the diamond cut
Ice paradise living in the thug life
Married to the game fuck a lame diggin out your wife
Loving all these block wars do shit thats uncalled for
Make money in your spot get it locked shoot down four
For all your ghetto revenues
Spraying through any avenue
Running Ill be grabbing you
Hogtied and smacking you
With heaters on purpose
Hold you hostage like you was Turkish
And your pussy ass elevated gut it down your worthless
These thoughts is vivid and we talk if you live it
Rappers brag about a town but dont get respect in it
Aint a damn shame whats thats mans name
That got a flame to his nut
Clearing out his spot with a rusted hook
Trust me its not this entertainment
Ask the judges that face me on the arrangement
Plus I came with hundreds of niggas that think the same
The plastic hotter than acid to melt the brain
You know the rest man

I just pray for the day when Im able to say that Im placed with the greats
And my names with the Kanes and the Waynes and the Jays and the Dres
And the Yes and the Drakes and the J Dillas Jadas Cool Js
And the Ras and amazin as Nas is and praise to the Gods of this
Shout to the golden age of HipHop and the name of this song is

4632,"Cruisin for a bruisin Im takin no crap
Pipe bomb in my trunk got a nine in my lap
Im layin for a sprayin tonight theres no playin
The posses most strapped tonight the crews weighin
Dust is burnin the steering wheels turnin
Im out a week Im already earnin
Suckers crossed tonight its their loss
Payback time boy lifes the cost
Gauges out the window one lay cross the roof
They all die if those suckers aint bulletproof
Im rollin death tollin of course the cars stolen
But Im blind to whats wrong all I want is whats golden
A fool in a fight too dumb to know right
Fuckin blue light read em their rights
Drama x4 
I copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
I keep a bank for that dont know about the rest
Copped another piece hit the dark streets
Rollin once again fuck the damn police
Called up my boy Joe a roof job pro 459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleek he cased the joint a week
3 am on the dot inside we creep
Got Alpines Fishes JVCs
Motorola Phones Sony Color TVs
Had the ride packed up til we heard Freeze
Fuckin blue lights read em their rights
Drama x4 
4 in the morning lights in my face
Thats the time you know the place
Cuffed in the room with the twoway glass
Detects in effect cold doggin my ass
Whats your date of birth Whats your real name
I stuck to my alias I know the game
If they dont know who you are then they dont know what youve done
Youre just makin this harder on yourself son
I know this shit by heart Im too clever
Have you ever been arrested before Nope never
DA reject all over his face
You see no confession no case
Then my boy started illin talkin and tellin
Son of a bitch he was a snitch
Drama x6 
Under I went I caught a case and half
He dropped the mallet then the judge laughed
Now Im in the penzo chillin like a real pro
I cant move til the man says go
A puppet of the big game an institutional thing
I wouldnt be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
Youre just a number another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you greet
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you sees a priest
The lights dim your life ends
Drama

I never knew a luhluhluh a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen I aint seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit lets spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I aint gon assault them cause I probably did it too
Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they cant handle the glare
You know I aint the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near its important that we close to the Most High
Regardless of what happen on Him lets rely
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Its important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
Theres so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But thats fly by night for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi nights moon you my light
If Heaven had a height you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop through you I see that all
Lets stick to understandin and we wont fall
For better or worse times I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anythin
Friends well stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love aint simple
Why cant it be anythin worth havin you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It dont take a whole day to recognize sunshine
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Its kind of fresh you listen to more than hiphop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when its time to
Thinkin you fresh suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when Im lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when its time to
My hearts dictionary defines you its love and happiness
Truthfully its hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex aint gon keep you
But as my equal its how I must treat you
As my reflection in light Ima lead you
And whatevers right Ima feed you
Diggada diggada diggada diggadiggadada
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you peace
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Ill take my chances
Before they pass
Pass me by oh darling
You need to look at the other side
Youll agree

The bullet killed him on his nineteenth birthday
Now what a sad way to lose your life
At that time he had a newborn daughter and a future wife

Cant explain the actions of the trigger guy but still I try

Once again its the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Aint it a shame rap is goin crazy 
The lyrical skills are gettin kinda lazy 
The gift theyre shootin couldnt even graze me 
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play G
Now who drops rhymes for the mind only a handful
Only the deaf dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet Im tired of hearin this
Bang bang shoot em up baboo you get buckbucked

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasnt
Nothin lyrical hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters nothin against your
Fake lifestyle but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive cause its inedited you think its better with
Explicit illicit lyrics but like a sedative
The rhymes aint hype so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brothers flows like
So here come the flow the lovable huggable colorful flow
The brother that glows in the dark cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe the highs and lows
Its up and down and out you go
So back up regroup slow down and check the cut

Im proud to present this cypher to my technicians cause this one has been a long time coming
So I called on my big homie Big Scoob and my lil homie JL B Hood
Lets go

Yall aint wit it then Ima go get it and ship it in in the back of the bus
Nah Im just fuckin with it bickin back and having fun
Bullshit Im having none pussy niggas best hold their tongue
Flip a switch and Im with the shit get to clapping clips and Im banging drums
Ignorant with this ignant shit and my only wish is you come get some
I told you bitches where the fuck Im from
Showed you this is where the luck might run
Out for the doubt
What you do witcha mouth about to be part of the reason I come and bust my gun
Finnicky front wanna be just like them
Niggas a boar be hunted just like one
This no war nor kid time son
Its a warning do nothing dumb
You can feel what it is when exposed to the Gs
A real one exists this close to the lead
Get ahold of the disk you suppose to believe
The show is a trip and the flows a disease
Coke gotta fizz got zones of the trees
Never let em live let alone let em breathe
Not a fuck I could give like fucks what are these
Pros we official the hos Lebanese
Strange got the game in a guillotine choke
Language aim seen finna be quoted
Know it aint my enemy hope
Swank if you cant consider me dope
Ya skank wanna grope me and Joey Cool both
On the bull with a 7 no Toni Kuko
Bitch checkin to whenever you post
They come out the woodworks know whenever you close
You know what Im yelling know somebody better tell em
Hardhead make a softass let me get em
Up in art class was the only time he drew a weapon
Up the bar blurred lines Im a urban legend
No TI TMI but Im fuckin with protection
Paperwork in red like Im makin a correction
Select what I said hope you makin the connection
We come at a nigga head it come off him in a second
Me and Tech got high said we finna do work
Spat hot lava finna shoot first
You expect not vibe I could only do church if
My nigga was alive I am in the booth hurt
Know that Ima ride why I tell em B Hood
You would look odd in my neck of the woods
If I really wanna slide in your ho I could
But Im God with a double O yall know Im good
Step like I should

Southside
If Young Metro dont trust you Im gon shoot you
I dont usually do this but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking bout decisions man I shoulda left with Juve
Got me busting with my cutie I cant trust her nor her booty
Every night she acting newschool I am not gon be a student
I got class I got trash I got bills I got pills
Heard them boys gon write me off I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam I got flash I got dreams and nightmares past
Im allergic to the brrrr Im using wings to wipe my ass
Right now Im high as shit Im on the Bumbu straight
I just got out my bitch felt like the Sunken Place
She give me drunken face she give me highest praise
And when Im in LA Im smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Moms would come home they would argue he didnt put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirt and clean up at the same time
Right now Im on a couple percs and leaning at the same time
Remix baby Tunechi
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now got me talking about my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now and I need ya in my life
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now
I got so many felonies I might cant never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon pull some strings so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them whatyoucallits and it boosted my stamina
Now Im fucking her on the banister guess I just East Atlantad her

Damn these hoes aint got no manners bruh wheres the manager

Cause you fuck like a granny fuck youre just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you aint gotta fuck with me my nig but youre stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me my nig You grew up with me
I dont usually do this unless Im drunk or Im high
But Im both right now got me talking about my life

Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water my location is remote
Shoutout Yachty but this aint a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give I mean

3184,"When I was fifteen sixteen when I really started to play guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible becauseit wasthe dream was so big
That I didnt see any chance because
I was living in a little town was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought Well now I may have a little bit of a chance
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music but compose music
At that time in Germany in 69 70 they had already discotheques
So I would take my car would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didnt want to drive home and that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive in the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s
The sounds of the 60s of the 70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said Wait a second I know the synthesizer
Why dont I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future
And I didnt have any idea what to do
But I knew I needed a click so we put a click on the 24track
Which then was synced to the Moog Modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didnt realize how much the impact would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
But everybody calls me Giorgio
Once you free your mind about a concept of
Harmony and of music being correct
You can do whatever you want
So nobody told me what to do
And there was no preconception of what to do

4389,"The Killing of Georgie Pts 1 2 Lyrics
Oh yeah
In these days of changing ways
Socalled liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine
Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin more or nothin less
The kindest guy I ever knew
His mothers tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest
Pa said There must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all Ive said and done for him
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Leavin home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way
Accepted by Manhattans elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George
Along the boulevards hed cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of 75
He said he was in love I said Im pleased
George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell
Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down Fifth Avenue
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passerby
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgies head hit a sidewalk cornerstone
A leather kid a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night
The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on FiftyThird and Third
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Georgies life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote
He said Never wait or hesitate
Get in kid before its too late
You may never get another chance
Cause youths a mask but it dont last
Live it long and live it fast
Georgie was a friend of mine
Oh yeah
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo

7479,"Doo Wop That Thing  Gordons dub LyricsYo remember back on the bully when cats used to harmonize like
Wooo wooo wooo
Yo yo my men and my women dont forget about the Deen
The Sirat alMustaqim yo
Its about a thing
Yo yo yo if you feel real good lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah yeah
Put them up put them up
Put them up put them up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Its been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Member when he told you he was bout the Benjamins
You act like you and him then give him a little trim
To begin how you think you really goin to pretend
Like you wasnt down when you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even foolin him
If you did it then then youd probably again
Talking out your neck saying youre a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Whore you going to tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass cause youre thinking its a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine
Dont be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now Lauryn is only human
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
Its silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans come again
Yo Awhen when come again yeah yeah 
When when come again yeah yeah 
My friend come again yeah yeah 
Guys you know youd better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Dont care who they offend popping yin Like you got Yen 
Lets stop pretend the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men still living in his mothers basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child supports late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
How you gonna win when you aint right within
Unh unh come again

Hey we have some very intelligent women in here man
Do you think you too young to really love somebody
No no no no no
I say it for me and I am adult and I say wait you too young to be in love
This is silly you infatuated with them
You got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I dont know
It is a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody
Well you tell me whats the difference
Whats the difference
You can love anybody but when you in love with somebody
You looking at it like this
You taking that person for what he or she is
Not matter what he or she look like
And no matter what he or she do
If you can fall in love you can fall out of love
You might stop being in love with that person but you cant stop loving that person
Sometimes they never been loved before they never been in love before
They dont know the feeling to be loved
She poetic
She killed you

5328,"Chorus Guru and Stikken Moov repeat 2X 
Whats the question Why are you flexin
Heres the answer choice of weapons
Yo The Remainz kid why you flexin like a bicep
Heat on your hip just to get a rep it aint worth it
Just because you pack a biscuit doesnt mean you cant
Become another statistic you figure it
Lifes a gamble even for vandalz I handle mine with minds
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest
The fear of layin in wreck causes the stress
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when its best
Yo little big man feelin your oats because youre strapped
Bustin a cap at another kid whos black
It aint all that when the shots are flyin back
You made a choice and the choice you made was wack
Kinda tipsy with the liquid confidence
Pullin your pistol when it doesnt make sense
To be the bigger man you figure
But in the end it dont pay when youre livin by the trigger
Chorus 2X
Yeah its the master of the who what where and the why
But still I got a problem with seein my brothers die
Ive been around and lived past the average age of us
In every obituary a full page of us
The game is money but what about inner wealth
The mental the spiritual and physical health
But still everyday the city is a test
Thats why some people feel a gun is the best
No doubt I pack protection but every altercation
Or situation doesnt deserve blastin I mastered precisions
Choice of weapon should I peel or peel out
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts
Chorus 2X
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam Stikken Moov swarm
Ready to bust off like Ron Jeremy but I chill G
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three
Thats why I wield the steel yes my microphone is crazy real
Im not the one sellin out to get the mass appeal
But jail cells are filled with my peeps
While the rest are gettin killed in these ill ass streets
Chorus 2X
So pick your weapon a mic or a gun
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns check it
Leavin the spot I seen some wild kids
One stepped to me asked me to freestyle kid
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side
I looked him in the eye smiled and walked to my ride
He was actin kinda hard on the surface
I said to myself that it really wasnt worth it
Yo you think youre all that cause you pack heat
Seein your own brother play the concrete in defeat
Tryin to prove yourself while you put the next man down
But what goes around comes back black best believe that
Chorus 2X
You know what Im sayin
Thats all the real heads all over the world
That realize that this music is real
That we keep it real like that
Peace to all my brothers on the third
And all the real brothers in hiphop
Its like a raps new generation thing baby
Peace to Guru

Malice found religion Tony found prison
Im just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilos got a sibling
Father knows best wash my hands alls forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants Jacksons no room for George
Yeh the fear of Gods in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul inspiration for your life
Every dime I made in this life wasnt disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime its revealed
What goes around comes around this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that Im free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but Id rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman say my name and Ill appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem pole whats my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
Im here now watch how many niggas plans change
First class flights Ciroc soaked nights
Waking up to models what a motherfuckin life

Matter fact you dont know how mad you made my men

And after they through with you they go and blaze your men
You was ass way back then should of laid you then
Grab a nigga out the building trey straight to his chin
Pull a bullet to his chest that a change his wind
And dont care bout the pain hes in
Im no killa but you could make me one
Im no thug but you could make me one
Im no hustla but you could make me one
Im no gangsta so dont make me one
Who would ever ever ever make a nigga try me
What you think sumthin tangy bout Mase I see
What it take for blood to clog niggas IVs
For cats to sit back and think why me
Now why you better yet how you
Be a light skinned nigga that get fount sky blue
Either all summer long you been ducking Piru
Or half yall cats just scared to buy blue
Wit Mase your rival Mase is liable
Put Blink beside you then tape and tie you
Rape and hide you in the lake they find you
With no prints cops cant trace what I do
Now your mother think her baby didnt deserve this shit
Well her baby shouldnt fuck with a third of my brick
I got people thats payin think they aint concern with this
Is you thinkin how could one bullet burn like this
Put the word out I want that black suburban hit
One think side of the story from a top journalist
When you dropped in a box with worms on your wrist
Other niggas learn from this


Im no killa but you could make me one
Im no thug but you could make me one
Im no hustla but you could make me one
Im no gangsta so dont make me one
Half these cats spit it dont even live it
And according to they digits they all midgets
See me I rocks wit it 6 months shock bid it
I go up state see all my cats and count digits
You got guns but never get knocked wit it
Cuz if Im stopped wit it the cops get it
Im one of the few that talk about gators and got lizards
You got ice but never go on the block wit it
Jerk your work and you go n still rock wit it
Ill rapped till Im clapped like Big and Pac did it
Mase get his message from a lifer
He said shorty I was young I was just like ya
Now Im illy wit the best snipers
Did wheelies wit the best bikers
Gettin head from confessed dikers
Saddle thugs and thats just righteous
Niggas dont want a war niggas just hyper
Movin off a motions Im no dude for commotion
Leave niggas bruised in the ocean
Neck broken head open chest soakin
Fund him piece by piece wit the rest floatin
Im no killa but you could make me one Yeah dont make me one 
Im no thug but you could make me one Motherfucker dont make me one 
Im no hustla but you could make me one Fuck what you heard nigga

Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
Im the N9ne Ima look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times itll be better leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin but lies quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin
Hes a beginner and hopes for your demise folks Ima despise
Never do try to listen

Clueless when you scribble on your pad
