Got me questioning what I think is important
I can't even lie, think of you when I'm with her
Look me in my eye, tell me that you feel different
Drove two hours just to stay the night with you
Haven't seen you in a year, but I still get you
Hurts to see you laugh 'cause I know I'll fucking miss that
How could I forget that?

You the only thing that makes me wish things were different
I might fly you out, get your ass on a one-way

Keep that away from me
I put the Heisman up to bad energy
No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy
Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee
Make the fool come out like, "Who is he?"

And that's the thing
That thing right there
That's my girl, I can't share
Maybe I'm selfish, I get a little jealous
I lose my mind when you say that
Balmain silk slip off your back
You get so impatient
I know you got your cravings
So tell me you didn't tell all of your girlfriends about this (yeah)
Tell me you still think my neighbors don't know, girl, you shout it (yeah)
Girl, I know that you've been trying, I swear I'm the proudest (yeah)
But the question is, girl, do you think you could live without it? (Without it)

Fuck you 24 hours

Fuck you 24 hours

Nothing on you when you naked
Got a pretty little heart, I don't wanna break it

Take you down with my guns, then we blaze, ooh
