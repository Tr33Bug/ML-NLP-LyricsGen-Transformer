Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree Lyrics[Verse 1]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

[Verse 2]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
