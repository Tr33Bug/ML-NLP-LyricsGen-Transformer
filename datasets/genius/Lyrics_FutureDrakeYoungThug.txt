[Verse 2: Drake]
Go to Palm Springs for a daytrip
Freeband, October's Own, it's the same shit
Shawty keep on knockin' back the shots, better pace this
Woah, woah, banknotes, presidential faces
Woah, woah, Bankhead, started seein' spaceships, woah
We just started fuckin', she impatient
Now she want a butt lift, now she want some LASIK
Just to see the bag clearer, that way she can chase it
Ayy, ayy
I remember grade six, I was up in Payless tryna get some Asics
Now I'm Nike'd down in a motherfuckin' snake pit
Now I'm type of nigga give it out and I don't take shit (808 my crew)
