(Last night, all I think about is you)
(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you

Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky, gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky, smooth perfume

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Verse 1]
When I was young and stupid my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me: "Please, don't worry"
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one-way ticket
Out west, that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion

[Chorus]
Bye-bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

[Verse 2]
Where I was from in NOLA, no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him, don't you blame me?
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust, he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dream

I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I-
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush, it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

Agnes, just stop and think a minute
Why don't you light that cigarette and
Calm down now, stop and breathe a second?
Go back to the very beginning
Can't you see what was different then?
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head

[Pre-Chorus]
Your head is so numb, that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions, that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine
[Verse 2]
You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time, you overdid the liquor
This time, you pulled the fucking trigger
These days, you're rolling all the time
So low, so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine?
Where went that billion-dollar smile?

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time from Mister Madness
And so it goes, a choking rose back
To be reborn, I want to hold you like you're mine

You're gone but you're on my mind
I'm lost but I don't know why

Mmm, I shut my eyes
You call but I just cut the line
I know your style
I know that you want one more night
And I'm backsliding
Into this just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now
[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love

[Verse 2]
Mmm, that purple touch
Everyone who sees you falls in love
You eat us up
You live like you're on camera
You slide on top
A moon to all the juice in us

[Pre-Chorus]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love
(Woo)

Maybe in time
When we're both better at life
Daylight can open my eyes
And you'll still be by my side
But meanwhile
I've got my contact high
You've got your powdered lies
We've got these summertime nights
Night by night, I let you eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
(Woo)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love
[Outro]
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love24Embed Helium Lyrics[Verse 1]
9:09
You gonna call it or am I?
One more time
This puppy love is out of line
One more slide
And then we're back to real life

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, and I'm falling now but it's so wrong
You talk like a man and taste like the sun
Ooh, and you lift your eyes up from the dust
I knew just then, I knew it was done
[Chorus]
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of you's at home with him
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of you's not part of this

[Verse 2]
Soft blue skies
Helium balloons float up away
Broad daylight
But we're sunflowers in the rain

[Verse 3]
My mama said they used to be white pyramids
They float above the sand, they're slowly sinking in
Are our foundations destined to keep crumbling
Just 'cause we started this with zero innocence?
I just can't build on something that begins like this
It's a blood diamond, flawless but for that one thing
[Bridge]
You just want backstreets, you don't want me
You just gonna hate it all the way
You just want backstreets, you don't want me
You just gonna hate it all the way

Hello, who is this? Hello?
Are you watching TV?
Say, "Bye-bye"
Bye-bye15Embed Mama’s Gun Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the summer, took my gun
And made him go to Neverland
He was something, my old husband
He had all you'd ever want
Did you say something? What'd you say?
Was that your voice or was that me?
Little voices buzzing poison
Backward noise from everything
Dr. Swango says I'm psycho
Says they all from Neverland
They'll never ever let me be
Was that your voice or was that me?
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Dirty Dustin, said he saw him
Playing ball with Dizzy Jim
Dizzy Jim had never spoken
Whispered back, "You murdered him"
My heart strings broke and it was me
I pull, they stretch infinitely

[Chorus]
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing

[Bridge]
Play with me, my love, in the summer sun
I'll be waiting in your favourite Cheshire grin
Lay with me, my dear, in the evening clear
I'll be dreaming in my paper-pale skin

[Chorus]
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
In the summer silence, I was getting violent
In the summer silence, I was doing nothing
