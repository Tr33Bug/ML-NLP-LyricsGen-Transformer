You Make My Dreams Lyrics[Verse 1]
What I want, you've got and it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle, the candle feeds the flame
Yeah, what I've got, full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together, and how, I can't explain

[Chorus]
Well, well, well, you
You make my dreams come true
You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you
Oh yeah, you make my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
[Verse 2]
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer, I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me and I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
Well, well, well, you
You make my dreams come true
You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you
You make my dreams come true

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far

She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door

Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around
[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch

But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
Use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

[Chorus]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time

Afternoon in the homeroom
They're about to let you go
And the locker slam on the plan
You had tonight
You've been messin' around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know could
Put you right
In the lot the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
There's life after high school
And that's why

Don't leave me alone 'cause I got to go home
Please (Leave me alone), I'm a family man
And I don't think..."1Embed When The Morning Comes LyricsI went downtown to see milady
She stood me up and I stood there waiting
But it'll be all right when the morning comes

Now I'm up in the air with the rain in my hair
I've got nowhere to go, I can go anywhere
And it'll be all right when the morning comes

Just in passing, I'm not asking that you can be anyone but you
But when you come home try to come home alone
It's so much better with two
Now I'm out in the cold and I'm getting old
Standing here waiting on you
It'll be all right when the Morning Comes

When the morning comes

When the morning comes

Just in passing, I'm not asking that you can be anyone but you
But when you come home try to come home alone
It's so much better with two

Now I'm out in the cold and I'm getting old
Standing here waiting on you
It'll be all right when the Morning Comes

When the morning comes

It'll be alright

I'm tired of playing on the team
Ooh, it seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace, face to face

And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh, yeah, you've got to understand, baby
Time out is what I'm here for

Say it
Say it isn't so

Say it
Say it isn't so

[Verse 1: Daryl Hall]
Say it isn't so painful
To tell me that you're dissatisfied
The last time I asked you, I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen
You see em' goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more

[Verse 2: Daryl Hall and (John Oates)]
(Say it)
Tell me what you want
Yeah, I'll do it, Baby, I promise right now
(Say it)
Who propped you up when you were stopped
Low motivation had you on the ground?

[Pre Chorus: Daryl Hall]
I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide Away, goodbye
But if there's a doubt, maybe I can give out
A thousand reasons why you have to say it isn't so

Babe, if we can't solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears?
Whoa, so you go again
When the leading man appears

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Always the same thing
But can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on?
[Chorus 1]
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you, you

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
But doesn't mean that much to me

I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

You take a piece of me with you
You just don't care, everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you, you

In the pouring rain
Just to see your face
I'd bare my soul to a total stranger
Just to say your name
And I'm not ashamed

Just to love you into every morning
I would change my name
And run away
I won't do it for money
I won't do it for pride
I won't do it to please somebody else
If it don't feel right

But I'll do it for you
And at least I'll try
I don't need any other reason
Than I feel it deep inside

I'll Do It For Love

I would write your name across the sky
So the world could see
What you mean to me
I'd sing songs at the top of my voice
In an empty room
Just to dance with you

And to love you into every morning
I'll leave the world behind
And I'll slow down time

I won't do it for money
I won't do it for pride
I won't do it to please somebody else
If it don't feel right
But I'll do it for you
And at least I'll try
I don't need any other reason
Than I feel it deep inside

He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder, as they moved cross the floor
When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms, and out the door

Yeah a man loves a woman, but he can't understand
Why she's sad when she stares, at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall
Drops a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today
We're so close, so close, yet so far away
Some people think, if you really believe
That's what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yea I know someone, who just heads for the sun
She says "I don't wanna be wise, I just wanna stay young"

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, though we're stuck in today
Baby we're so close, so close, yet so far away

There's a restless look in your eye tonight
There's a secret hurt in my heart
And the dream that pulls us together girl
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart

There's a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here
We gotta fight to keep it together girl
For the dream, that keeps us

So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
Who would of thought girl that we'd end up this way
Getting so close, so close
So far away
