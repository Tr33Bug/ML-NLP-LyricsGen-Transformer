Shh...

[Verse 1: Ryujin]
Guess who loves you, yeah, that's right

Where's the mystery? It's not time
Get you close, I get you close
Then bam, in the dead of the night!

[Refrain: Yuna, Yeji]
I'mma steal your heart away, you are gonna love me
You won't even know what hit ya 'til I'm baring my teeth
'Cause I'm so good at playing the role
I won't be the first one to fold
If loving you makes me a felon, who done it, who? You'll never know
[Pre-Chorus: Lia, Chaeryeong]
Am I getting you, getting you just a little confused?
You know I never could, never could stick to all of the rules

제발 stop it, please don't kill my vibe
