TranslationsPortuguêsΕλληνικάI’m Yours Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well you done done me in; you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love, love, love, love

We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be
Loved, love, love, love, loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait – I'm yours

[Outro]
Well open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need to complicate)

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily

Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love

It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
[Verse 1]
I've been chasing summer around
Searching for the sunshine
Looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition as it's happening
Diggin' into life cuz at times it can be saddening
Yea it can be a grey day, if you're lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now

[Pre-Chorus]
When the table's set for two
And there's nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else

I give you my word although I'm making words up
Unlonely ain't a word but I don't give a FRUCK
Cause I'm fresh from the farm where critics can't bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that ain't stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
I'd be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey, we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves: Never Phony
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living, never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together we're just a much better reflection of Love

And we could be homies

Oh, until the dawn it brings

Others only read of the love, the love that I love, yeah

You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
And based on your body language
And shoddy cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is
[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 2]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions, dear
Cause here we are, here we are

[Verse 3]
Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks ‒ they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words i'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 4]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And "kind and courteous" is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt
Cause here, here we are, here we are

You fucking did it
You really did it yeah
You really did it

[Verse 1]:
All those who are hanging round the water cooler
Will never believe how you tackled the thousand puzzle pieces
And you could see it before we completed it
Before we made it whole
How you put it all together with a blindfold
You're like a long game token that keeps the game going
But your claim to fame is how you like to lay low
Out of the lime light
Which can hurt your eyes
If you're not careful you'll become another devil in disguise
But you watch your back
You watch your back
You're growing eyes in the back of your head
To prevent another sneak attack
Sneak attack
You must be keeping secret weapons in your fanny pack
You're like my laughing gas, you got the cat to dance
You're like Lance on a mountain in the Tour de France
You got a wing span spanning the globe
You got gold
And you're teaching us to let go
You're a wise old owl when you're the cats meow
If this were twelfth grade you would be my cap and gown
If this were India then you would be a sacred cow
And I'd bow down to you
So grateful to the Gods for making you

You'll be standing up for equal rights of the American people
And you'll be meeting all the influential seekers with a similar dream

And a super hero cape on
You see the future as a sky full of possibility
With a spryness of mind and a psychic ability
You probably won't die at the hands of an enemy
And not in a den of inequity
You're not the average Joe, you're not the average Jane
You're not above or below, but you're never just plain
You never take no, personally
And any time you get stopped you try another way
Could we settle for a kiss without a cease and desist
If they ask we won't tell because we're activists

Yo, brother A to Z
Yo, whassup B?
Yo, what time is it?
Haha
It's laundry day

[Verse 1]
Well, let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
If you like the way I'm thinking, baby, wink at it
I may be skinny at times, but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'ma grab at it
Well, isn't it delicious? Crazy way that I'm kissin'
'Cause baby, listen to this, don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But don't ever quit 'cause soon I'm gonna let you in, but see
[Chorus]
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
Well, I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Like the geek in the pink
Like the geek in the pink, yeah
The geek in the pink

[Verse 2]
Well, this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often, that's what's the matter
At least I'm talking about it, keep my pattern of flattery
And she was starin' through the doorframe and
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
Well, she can get her toys outta the drawer then
'Cause I ain't comin' home, I don't need that attention, see

[Chorus]
I don't care what she might think about me
She'll get by without me if she wants
But I could be the one to take her home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

Hey baby, look at me go
From zero to hero
You better take it from a geek like me
Well, I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
Who wouldn't care if you com...plete them or not?

[Verse 3]
So what? I've got a short attention span
A coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand
My hip hop and flip-flops,  well it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock you kinda puts me in a tight spot
The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha
So I'm developing a language, and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker, and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener

[Chorus]
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down, it wouldn't be a let down
But sugar, don't forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another

Well, I'm the geek in the pink, yo
Geek is the color for fall, I'm the geek in the pink
So I'm the geek yo, in the pink yo

Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, Knew I looked like a big fool
I must of had the flu, I thought the shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me, what did I do
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
[Verse 2: Jason Mraz]
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

Young Wayne, prepare for change
Because it seem like girly don't care the same
You had my chain, you buried my name, then we had champagne

[Verse 4: Jason Mraz]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a face and laughed
I guess what I'm be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

Let's drive out to the desert at midnight
To dance in the dust of our headlights
And score some good seats for the sunrise
And dress up in clothes we don’t mind getting messed up
Where no one will know how to get us
We don’t need a map we'll just drive, drive, drive

[Chorus]
I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like
To spend the whole night with you, just you
You, just you
[Verse 2]
We can head north over the oceans of turquoise
Where after awhile there'll be no noise
Except for the sound of our heartbeats beating on
And we'll stand in a canyon alone
Singing our favorite songs
And wait for the words to return
In the echo echo echo echo echo echo

[Chorus]
I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what it's like to spend the whole night with you, just you
With you, just you

And I wanna get lost

Wake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap and the net will appear

The dream is over

Yes I, I'll know it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

Requesting that it's lifting you up
Up up and away
And over to a table at the Gratitude Café

And all the angels they'll be singing

I can't stop thinking about you
And dreaming of your smile
I can't stop reading into you
Love, oh yeah, you're the best book I've read in awhile
I don't just read you for the articles

You keep my heart a-beating
You're keeping me from sleeping
The only one I'm cheating is me if I don't take control
[Chorus]
We got nothing to lose, might as well hold hands
We're already fools so we might as well dance

Put your loving arms around me once more
And we'll go crashing into folks on the dance floor
You can walk all over my shoes if you want to

We got nothing to lose, might as well take off our pants
Yeah, we're already fools so we might as well dance

[Verse 2]
Soon the song will be over
We'll have to say goodnight
Don't you want some closure
Before you turn out the light
Honey, think of your heart
Yeah, the heart's too heavy to slow
Partly 'cause it's running the show
Partly 'cause the beat is connected to the feet
And I've got the sweetest crush on you
Baby, let's go

It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg

And it takes some words to make an action
And t takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction

And it takes a day to make you yawn, brother
And it takes some old to make you young

But it takes you years to know what love is
And it takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished, yeah

The question is why, why are we here?
To say our hellos and goodbyes, then disappear
This beautiful life, what is it for?

Is why should we pick ourselves up and start over again?
