Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine"

And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one

Float above the floor

Pardon my interruption
This drink's just settling in
All my reservations
A reason I don't exist
She says, "Can you keep a secret
A ceremony set for June
I know it's a rush but I just love him so much
I hope that you can meet him soon."

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we can't try
One last time
But I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime!

You wake me up cause I'm trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I don't wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells, wedding bells, wedding bells

Pardon my harsh reaction
You put me on the spot
And if I'm being honest
I'm hoping that I'd get caught
Showing you I'm unhappy
Letting you see my truth
Cause if you recall our anniversary falls
11 nights into June

[Chorus]
No, I don't wanna love
If it's not you
I don't wanna hear the wedding bells prove

Mr. Misdemeanor
Call me up and say you're needin' my love
Now you say you're leaving, oh yeah
Like you never even needed my love
Then I don't even see you (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Not even for a weekend or a month
So much you left between us (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
But you don't ever think about us (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look a-, look away
[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
You're always on my mind, it doesn't matter what I do, I do
Every single time, I keep on coming back to you
But keep me on the line, if loving you's a crime
Then I won't keep my love locked down for you
Every single time

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Yeah, I remember when we met
Like it was yesterday in Amsterdam (Smoke it up)
Making love through every season
Oh, every day, oh, every day
And I can't believe it now (I can't believe it)
You think, you think it's only physical (Oh no, no)
No good at getting even
The way you play, the way you play

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Why do, why do, why do, why do I want you
Even though you make it hard and I don't want to?
And now I'm out here catching feelings like I want you
But all you ever do is look away

Knew it right then when I looked in your eyes
And I said to myself, "It’s no surprise we ain't strangers"

Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true

And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting, sorry for the miscommunication
