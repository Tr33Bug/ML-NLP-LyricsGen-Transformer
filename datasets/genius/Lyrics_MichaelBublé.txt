I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility
[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

[Verse 2]
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
[Verse 2]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Verse 3]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Outro]
Sure it's Christmas once moreYou might also like5Embed Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
Another summer day has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome, but I wanna go home, mmm
May be surrounded by a million people, I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine, baby, how are you?
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another aeroplane, another sunny place
I'm lucky, I know, but I wanna go home
Mmm, I got to go home
[Chorus]
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day has come and gone away
In either Paris or Rome, and I wanna go home
Let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people, I
I still feel alone
Oh, let me go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

Just because I wander 'round the places we would go
Hopin' that I'd run into you one last time
Just because I never took your picture off my phone
Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind

[Chorus]
Just because I accidentally slip and say your name
When I hear our song, it makes me insecure
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
[Post-Chorus]
Am I lyin' to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had?
Am I lyin' to myself again
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad?

Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I will change
And I'd do anything to hear you say, "I'm yours"
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore

Am I lyin' to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had?

I know, I can be a bit jealous
But how the hell can I help it?
I'm so in love with you

[Chorus 2]
I don't want anybody lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me (hey!)
I don't want anybody lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me

[Outro]
Ooh my papa told me once or twice
Don't be cruel, don't be too nice (nobody, nobody)
My baby needs no lines  from me (hey!)
Whoaaah, and I know how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care (nobody, nobody)
My baby don't need no one but me-eee-eeeeEmbed Quando, Quando, Quando LyricsTell me, when will you be mine
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
We can share a love divine
Please don't make me wait again

When will you say yes to me?
(When will you say, yes to me?)
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
(Tell me, quando, quando, quando)
You mean happiness to me
(You mean happiness to me)
Oh, my love please tell me when
Every moment's a day
(Every moment's a day)
Every day seems a lifetime
(Every day, it seems like a lifetime)
Let me show you the way
(Let me show you the way)
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
Tell me, quando, quando, quando
(Tell me, quando, quando, quando)
Just say, it's me that you adore
And then darling, tell me when

Now, every moment's a day
(Every moment's a day)
Every day seems a lifetime
Let me show you the way

To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more
