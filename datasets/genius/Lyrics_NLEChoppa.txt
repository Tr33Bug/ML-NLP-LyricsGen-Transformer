I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit, I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a ho
Pull up with the gang, you know that we bangin'
What is your set, nigga? What is you claimin'?
I am a beast, you cannot tame it
Don't point a finger, this shit can get dangerous
These niggas hatin', these niggas plottin'
Ooh, he got money, I'm runnin' his wallet
You say you a killer, lil' nigga, stop it
In a shootout, your gun was droppin'
You really a fraud, you cannot stomp on this yard
My niggas, they scammin', they swipin' them cards
I am so high that I'm talkin' to stars
I'm gone off them jiggas, I'm poppin' them bars
Don't mind my pimpin', bitch, don't sweat me
Chopper got a kick, call that shit Jet Li
Sauce Gang dripped up, what is your recipe?
Gon' get an F if a nigga try testin' me
Whole lotta money, whole lotta guala
Hit the party fifty deep, nothin' but my shottas
Nigga tried me so you know I had to pop him
So many bullets, it confused the doctor
Whole lotta racks, whole lotta stacks
Fuck a headshot, I'ma shoot him in the back
Three-point-five rolled up in the Cack'
We don't smoke reggie, this shit called gas
I'm sticked up like a blind man
I'm super hot like a frying pan
He say that he gon' take somethin' from me
Ayy, just know, he lyin', man
I'ma up from my hip then blow like a whistle
Your bitch suckin' dick like a Kool-Aid pickle
Two bullets in your chest, that's a nipple
And if a nigga run up, I'ma pop him like a pimple
Get rich or die tryin', I'm feelin' like 50
Brand new chopper got double-D titties
Nigga, don't play me, I don't get silly

She calling me racist, she was dark skinned, but I want a redbone
Put his name on this bullet, the trigger I pull it, you better order a headstone (Brrrr)
And now that boy head gone
Bitch nigga, you a snitch
My niggas they vicious, bitch, I am a menace
And let's have a shootout like I'm in a scrimmage

Shot him in the teeth, they call me a dentist
Walk down on my opp, I ain't leavin' no witness
Shoot a hundred some shots, I won't stop 'til it finish
I break in your house like I came through the chimney
And I'm high as a bitch 'cause the Perc' in my Henny

I hop on the beat and you know I’ma kill it
My nigga loose screws, you know that they drillin’
I run up my money, I love this feeling
Remember them days a nigga was stealin’
Hopped in the game, I got it on lock
My niggas got dope, they trap out they socks
The police pull up, we run from the narcs
We always on go, you know we don’t stop
Cherry on top when I aim with the beam
I’m burnin’ her head, no Charlie Sheen
My hoes, they grown, don't fuck with the teens
My bitch, she bad, boujee, and mean
Yeah, fuck that, get back on the sub
If a nigga diss me, them shots get to bustin’
I ain’t got time with all that fussin’
Soon as I see him, you know that he duckin’
Shoot up the spot and make him move out
Soon as he move, I find his house
Don’t fuck with the rats, don’t fuck with the mouse
If he snitch, put the gun in his mouth
He thought that we was playin'
'Til we pulled up with sticks, yeah (No cap)
Glizzy got a beam and it came with a dick, yeah (No homo)
Choppa got a scope and it came with some tits, yeah (Yeah)
Don’t get fucked up out your life, we shoot us a flick, yeah (Yeah)
Whenever we aim, you know we attack
Shoot through his stomach, it come out his back
My niggas, they bangin’ and ready to stack
Diss on the set, get put in a bag
We love the money, the drugs, the guns
I don’t ever beat ’cause I’m countin’ my funds
I’m always workin’, I don’t have fun
Before you diss me, know your pros and cons
Let’s have a shoot out, I’m ready to die
Face to face, eye to eye
The last thing that he saw was the fire
Put him on a tee, now he up in the sky
My killers outside, they don’t wanna be seen
They come in the show if you makin’ a scene
Choppa R. Kelly, let that bitch sing
How the fuck I'ma miss when I got me a beam?
I’m done, sike
I pull up to shoot, you pull up to fight
Shoot him in his leg, he beg for his life
Put one in his head like he was on Skype
Kick down the door (Yeah), bitch, get on the floor (The floor)
Where is the bread? ’Cause we need all the dough
Give me the cash (The cash), I came for the bag (The bag)

Park the car before we hit the street, I'm hoppin' out on feet (Better on feet)
Get up close so I can see his teeth but I'ma keep it brief
Asked if he remember me, then introduced him to my heat (Remember me?)
Skrrt off the block, you followin' this car, your whip be cream cheese (Come here, brrt)

Gave her a towel and told her she fine
She kept suckin' 'til she started cryin' (Come here, come here)
Point 'em out, shoot 'em out, I spot him, I got him (Come here)
He started runnin', so I caught him (Ayy, ayy)
Bag on his head, I bought him (Ayy)

Snort it right off of his gun
Shot a hundred (Yeah), then paid a hundred for his bond (No, no)
Send a diss, I won't respond (No)
Slam dunk a nigga like a nigga was LeBron (Come here)
Leave a nigga where he stay
Same place that I met him, I made him lay (Come here, come here)

Leave him shitty like Nutella

Whole lotta shots when it come out the Drac'
Chop a nigga up, then put him in the lake (Brrt)
Shiesty young nigga, they call me a snake
Ayy, fuck all that, Dreek, shoot 'em in the face
Send a hit at five, he was dead by six (By six)
Got shot seven times, but the eighth shot missed
Nine shots in the clip, could've sworn it was ten
Didn't fuck with 12, I was eleven again
I need me a trophy, the best to sin

If I tell you run off, is you really finessin' it? (Ayy)
If I give you a brick, are you gon' sell that shit? (Ayy)

We might as well get the mother

If my brother don't like him, I don't
Somebody tell him he in trouble
I paid too much for my motherfuckin' guns for me to scuffle
Gangster young nigga, I feel like Gucci (Gucci)
Fucked her so hard, left blood on her coochie
Made her said, "Ooh," put my thumb in her booty
I'll be damned, this dumb ass ho just pooted
Who ain't with the murder? Lil' nigga, I kill
That night he died, that was my idea
Told my niggas slide, make sure he don't live
But that's a lil' secret, just keep it concealed

Got shot in his spine, but you watchin' his back

Feelin' like I ain't got nobody, but you always beside me (You beside me, beside, yeah)
Me and you versus everybody, can't nobody stop me
Can't nobody stop me (Can't nobody stop me)
Wake up in the mornin', grab my stick, then I kiss you
Make a couple plays, then you know a nigga miss you
Soft spot for you, like a nigga was some tissue
But I'm hard on a nigga, 7.62's gon' hit you
Every time I pop a Perc', I think about my past
Reminisce about these bitches that I dogged in the past
But I'm doin' right by you, 'cause I want this shit to last
And if you get another nigga, I'ma put him in a bag
Real spill, a real thug, I was taught to kill
Seen my nigga get whacked, I ain't shed a tear
Tired of the fake love, I really want somethin' real
Damaged up inside, but somehow you made a nigga heal

How you make a nigga happy through my pain and my trauma?
And we cruising up in traffic got the top down in the summer
I got this Glock up in my lap, 'cause you know we in the jungle
I pull the trigger, let it run
I can’t let a nigga take me from you
She said, "These niggas can’t do it like you"
That’s why a nigga all into it with you
And baby what's on your mind, what's your mood

Sole mission, sole purpose
Mom knew I was worth it since the day that I was birthed and came out of her lurkin'
Lookin' at all of the nurses, she said I was special
Knew that shit, that was for certain
I would've thought this world was perfect, but it came with some curses
Ayy, read between the verses, if the truth, you been searchin'
I woke up, I'm alеrted, I was feelin' like a servant
Ain't a part of thе circus, my soul been overworkin'
She can't handle my burden, but she say she want a Birkin
I fell asleep in churches, I ain't know what he was chirpin'
Within myself, I got faith, then prayers start unfoldin'
I know that God real, but not the way that they had told us

Ayy, swing like I'm Tyson, but I ain't doin' no fightin'
And I've been feelin' righteous, I'm going through enlightenment
Conscious of a psychic, in between her like hyphens
They sayin' I don't know shit, but wait 'til it hit the fan
Groundin' up in the sand, the work put in, I seen dividends
I'm a bigger man, better man, I got a better plan
If you don't understand, where's somebody with some understandin'?
Pineal gland in my crown and I got the upper hand
Put the blues in rubber bands, I attract abundance
Affirmations daily, that's why blessings keep on comin' in
3-6-9, when I wake, I write it three times
Six times in the daytime, nine at nighttime
Put positive thoughts into your heart, it'll change your DNA
Negative thoughts, they fall apart, now a nigga thinkin' straight
I don't even smoke weed no more, I put that on the Heaven's gates
Speakin' on the Heaven's gates, I know I'm going to Heaven, man
Ayy, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm eating on a vegan plate
Don't take me to Chick-fil-A, I'm eatin' at the Grand Cafe
They ain't open on Sunday anyway
Fuck your dinner date
You are what you eat, I'm countin' green, eatin' celery
I don't care what nobody else think or say
Self-love the best love, self-hate got you out of shape
Distractions all in your face, ayy, tell me when they gone away
Donald Trump the last president, ain't no more candidates
Turned my backyard to farmland, but grew up watching Gangland (Gangland)
On the block hangin', I had my Drac' singin
All the negative you put in, you get it back, that's dangerous
Felt like all my karma came back when I got famous
Put the good in, you get the good out
I don't even tote my gun no more, 'cause I'm knowin' that I'm good now
Universe keep working for me, ain't nobody gonna touch me
