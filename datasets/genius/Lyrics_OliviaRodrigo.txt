I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Bridge]
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do

Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
[Verse 2]
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me

I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

[Verse 2]
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you
[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

I want it to be, like, messy

[Verse 1]
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
[Chorus]
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

[Post-Chorus]
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best

Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff

It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band

Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad

Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush

She raised her brothers on hеr own

With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?

[Verse]
Long blonde hair, daddy's a millionaire
Nobody knows her, but everybody wants to
That's what I see
Europe trips, kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything that I'll never be

[Chorus]
Twenty-first century girls are perfect
And I know it isn't real, it's all so stupid
But digital love, it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel, it's what they'll believe
Twenty-first century girls are flawless
And I say I didn't care, but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
Yeah, I want that twenty-first century loveYou might also like2Embed Out of the Old Lyrics[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I don't fit in with these familiar faces
And the games they play don't mean a thing to me
I know there's so much more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't stop dreamin', and thinkin'
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
If I leave this, I'm riskin' almost everything
Am I on the right road?
[Chorus]
Outta the old, I've gotta find my way
Into the new, give anything it takes
I wanna know, if no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
If I go out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Yeah, I wanna know (Ayo, ayo)
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
Out of the old

[Verse 2]
I wish these streets were still enough for me
I wish this town could give me everything
But I still feel stopped while every light turns green
Why can't I let it go?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't stop dreamin', and thinkin'
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
Leavin' all this, I'm riskin' almost everything
But there's only one road

So much has happened, think of what we've done
In the time that the Earth has traveled 'round the Sun
Winter, spring, summer, and we're back to fall
We've been together, hand-in-hand through it all

[Pre-Chorus]
From the minute we kissed and my heart skipped a beat
To the night that we danced, I was swept off my feet
Sure as every year has to come to an end
I'd go spinnin' 'round the Sun with you again and again
And again and again
[Chorus]
I think I kinda, you know
I think I kinda, you know
Like the way that we flow
Like the way that we go
And I love
I think I kinda, you know
I think I kinda, you know, you know, you know

Sit in your car, wait in the dark
Radio is up and so is your guard
You don't know what to say
You're faking a smile, you say that you're fine
And maybe it'll all work out in time
You’ve always been good that way

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more
[Chorus]
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

[Verse 2]
You told me your past
You hated your dad
And when you left college, couldn't wait to go back
Cause you really trusted me
And what did I do? What did I do?
I built you up, abandoned you
And I'm too proud to say sorry

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

[Chorus]
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
