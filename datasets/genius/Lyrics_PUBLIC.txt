Make You Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay
'Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
Doesn't matter anyway
In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothin' funny
Just to talk

Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
[Verse 2]
Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it again, again
So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess
And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat

You need to know
We'll take it slow
I miss you so
We'll take it slow

Through my fingers are so numb (We'll take it slow)
And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)
That you were not the one?

Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I won't stop until I make you mine

Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
In the middle of the night
In her wedding gown
Says that she can do it but
Is she trying?

Beautiful girl
Hasn't grown up yet
And she's wasting all her feelings on
A boy she's never met
Says that she is happy but
Is she lying?
[Pre-Chorus]
Running and she's running again
She's trying to understand but she can't
Running and she's running again
She's crying by herself 'cause she can

[Chorus]
Do you know her?
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you?

You see her walking around
It's the middle of the night
And nobody makes a sound
Says that she can do it but
Is she lying?

Are you gonna say what you wanna say?
Are we gonna do this right?

Put on a face made of plastic
And hide my fears behind a silhouette
I act like I'm fine when I'm hurtin'
Simple to smile, but so hard to forget

But I'm already trapped between her teeth
All my friends are begging me "Don't go"

Think we could die together
Now this is now or never
Think we could die together
You numb the pain
My sugarcane, sweet lemonade
Don't want to live foreverEmbed ILoveU Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't say it again
You're not my lover
You're no longer a friend
And I can't pretend
That it won't destroy me when I see you again
Don't say it again
You're not my lover
You're no longer a friend
And I can't pretend
That it won't destroy me when I see you again
[Pre-Chorus]
But, what is talk?
Talk is cheap
The words we say
Are sounding so empty

[Chorus]
I love you
Only hurts when it's coming from you
I love you
Only hurts, only hurts
I love you
Only hurts when it's coming from you
I love you
Only hurts, only hurts

[Verse 2]
Don't say it again
I'm trying to move on but you're still in my head
And I can't pretend
That I won't be haunted by the things that we said
Don't say it again
You're not my lover
You're no longer a friend
And I can't pretend
That it won't destroy me when I see you again

Feelin' relaxed
Ain't that easy
When your hands are on his chest
Hidin' my face
In the backseat
Pretendin' I'm not stressed
Holdin' my breath
Goin' crazy
'Cause his lips might be touchin' you
But I can't say
What's in my head
'Cause I'm afraid he'll still be the one that you choose
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel you slippin' through my fingers
But I'm not ready to give you up

[Chorus]
If you want me
To be honest
It still hurts to hear your name
It's so hard not
Bein' jealous
Why can't you look my way?
If you want me
To be honest
You're the one I'll always crave
Stick around you
Long enough to
See you push him away-ay-ay

[Post-Chorus]
If I'm bein' honest
If I'm bein' honest

[Verse 2]
Would you tell me
If I already missed my chance?
Are you like me?
Do you regret
The things you've left unsaid?
Throwin' away
Every thought of
Every girl that I know but you
So I can keep
You in my head
'Cause I'm afraid that you'll be the one that I lose

Beautiful girl sitting all alone
She can’t make friends with the world
She’s better on her o-own

[Pre-Chorus]
And why-y-y did you do it, break her heart?
And it's over now
She wants a new start
And she can do it with me, with me
[Chorus]
I said, "Do you wanna be my love?
Do you wanna be my love?
Do you wanna be my love?
Do you wanna be my love?
What if you liked it?"

[Verse 2]
She wants to tell her friends what she’s all about
But when I look in her eyes I can’t figure her out

[Pre-Chorus]
So, now she’s saying
“why-y-y did you do it, break my heart?
And it’s over now and I want a new start
But what is wrong with me, with me?"

You got me shaking like a summer tree
You said the wind don't blow for you and me
But it's fine 'cause you're my honeybee

Hot flashes, coming when we see the dark patches of your mind
