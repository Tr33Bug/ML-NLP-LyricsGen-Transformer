(Shout out my nigga Synco)

[Chorus]
Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

Iceberg want a bag, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane
[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change

I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)

(I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw, hey, Lilkdubb)

[Verse 1]
I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend
[Chorus]
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (Kdubb)

[Verse 2]
I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

Ahead of my class, yeah, I always been the smartest (Bitch)
Ain't no competition even though they try they hardest
I know they be hating, but I'm in my bag regardless (Flex)
Give this shit a year or two, let's see who get the farthest
Don't play in these streets before you turn into a target (Boom, boom, boom)
You could think you crazy but my shorties get retarded

Feel like Jordan vs. Utah, I'm deadly with that last shot (Bitch)
Back to poking niggas, if I lose everything that I got
You keep flicking up with them rolls then we might have to enter yo' slot
Put that barrel on yo' head, take yo' new chain and yo watch (Pussy)
I been T'd since I got that news my homie dead
Caught yo homie lacking- (Bop, knocked off his dread)
Just for satisfaction, we'll come take off a nigga head (Haha)
Hollows like a deadly virus, bodies drop when that shit spread
Explode in his flesh, make a mess, get ripped to shreds
Show no mercy for the enemy, nobody getting spared
Man, you niggas bitches, why the fuck would I be scared?
Thirty shots up in my bomb, my momma told me, "Be prepared" (Ooh)
Heard the streets been talking, I know what they said
Capalot been gridin', shorty gon' get to that bread (Flex, flex)

Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

[Verse 1]
Swervin' on the E-way, don't care if I crash in this coupe
Shit I'm thinkin' 'bout too real, might lose my mind in this coupe
Can't relapse off these drugs, man, R.I.P. to Juice
We was tweakin' off them Percs, I popped my last one with you
Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits
We was playin' give and take on that front line with my troops
Ayy, like who want smoke? We got plenty guns
Keep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs
It was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun

[Verse 2]
Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest
Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues
I been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool
I'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moods
He the type to get excited 'cause he made The Shade Room

Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit

Walk in court in them shackles, see my mama, her eyes tearin’
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something, it's all about persevering
They was counting me out, I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans, spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah, I know that they hate, I'm the man, ain't tryna hear it

Phone on DND, I'm out in Cali whippin' through the mountains
Just cruisin', feelin' my song, windows down, speakers pounding, yeah
My engine roaring and that Gucci tiger growling
Expensive taste, my clothes foreign, I be dripping like a fountain
Need new shoes, I started hustling ’cause I didn’t get no allowance
Speeding down the wrong path, found my lane, then I rerouted
Hottest in my city, I had every record label scouting
I got rich and left the hood, still don't leave the crib without it
Swear it ain’t no better feeling than thumbing through these thousands
So much money, can't keep track, I think I might need an accountant
I been runnin' up that check, them blue hundreds just keep piling
Came a long way from depression, all these riches keep me smiling

[Verse 2]
Couldn't leave my brother in them trenches, told him come and stay with me
We gon' live like kings for all them nights ain't have no place to sleep
Niggas watched us starving and never offered us a plate to eat
Took off, now they mad, but I know that they won't wait for me
Last year I took a trip to every place that I couldn't wait to see
Granny, I'm locked up again, sat in that station faithfully
Now I'm the golden child, I used to think my mama hated me
Ain't budging 'bout no problems, what a nigga gon' come take from me?
I heard you a robber, on that concrete, you gon' lay deceased
This .40 waving like a blowdryer, gon' hit his face with heat
With this shit for life, forever gang until I'm 83

Still with the gang though, one false move, them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say they look for me
I ain't sacrifice the shit I lost, it was took from me
Almost went insane, went insane, went insane
From all this pain, all this pain, all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me, they keep me laughin'

Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

Wanna know if you really fuck with me, girl, what's your angle?
It's only for the better if I'm tryna change you
Lovin' me ain't easy, if you leave, I don't blame you
Trauma got me fucked up, so I'm mentally unstable
I got wrapped up in my emotions, now I'm tangled
Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin' can get painful
Watch how I move, one wrong decision can be fatal
Hidden messages, conversations with my angels
Just walk with me and you'll see I'm tryna save you
Most times I'm by myself, I'm still confused from betrayal
From rags to riches, shit still hard, I'm just on phase two

On his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route
Hate the criticism, he uses music to block it out
By his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy
Messed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys
Up late night rappin' and they told him to quit makin' noise
Stuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed

Catch an opp, we dump the clip, it's time to reload
Put a scope on the AR just like a peephole
Think he a bully, we got choppers for the Deebo
Seven-figure nigga, tryna maximize them three O's
Before the bag, I was fucking all the freak hoes
Ballin' hard, young legend out the Chi, bitch, I'm like D-Rose
"Cap, how you make it out this shit?" I got the cheat code
Way more than life than just the hood, I'm tryna reach goals
Maxine my heart, since you've been gone, I miss your sweet soul, ayy
Never tell a statement, we won't leak those
Better not go talkin' to them people, better keep closed

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, "I promise you I won't change"

[Verse 2: Polo G]
We hold a grudge and we want blood, we can't look past the issue
Play with us and you gon' die, nigga, it's kinda simple
Show no mercy, we gon' kill whoever ridin' with you
Catch you on the other side, then we gon' have to get you
Condolences to your family, they gon' have to miss you
Lil Joe on go and he gon' spark, that's if I pass the signal
My right-hand mans, he got his name 'cause he gon' blast the pistol
Earned our stripes, we gon' blow if a nigga play foul, you would think we had a whistle
Lil Capalot, G-O-A-T, yeah, that's that guy's initials
Happiness and depression, I'm stuck inside the middle
I fell in love with dollar signs, won't let my mind forget you
Fuck it off, we spend it all on fast cars and shinin' crystals

[Verse]
You broke that bond, now when it come to you, my feelings weak
You let your selfish ways come in between our chemistry
Why you play with my heart and not show love consistently?
I put my life on the line, you wouldn't take that risk for me
Fucked up my trust, wish I could delete all our memories
Keep poppin' these pills, I hope it take away my misery
I got a dead soul, I been facing blunts of my enemies
Emotions bottled up, I don't know what's wrong and it's killing me
I cut so many off, my heart cold as December be
My mind keep racing, I been overthinking, I don't get no sleep
You don't understand how hard it was, I swear this shit so deep
I made it to the top and they all looked up in disbelief
They hate that I'm doin' better, they'd much rather get rid of me
I flex with no regrets 'cause they ain't show me no sympathy
I came a long way but I ain't as far as I'm finna be
I promise I'ma die a legend, I'ma make sure that you remember me
I used to daydream, I pictured everything so vividly
I had a feeling we'd be rich since the elementary
My peoples gone, got to witness everything they ain't get to see
Long live Maxine, I miss your love, wish you was here with me
You was a part of me, and since you left, I'm incomplete
My lifestyle used to be jump shots and sticking D
Life overwhelmed me, I said fuck school and hit the streets
I devoted my life to that corner just so I can get a G
Fuck a two-four, nigga, I ain't been home and it's been a week
We used to break down eight-balls, wishing we could get a key
Was tryna duck that indictment, the feds did a sweep
I hope you grippin' on your gun when them drillers creep
Lil' nigga grabbed his first glizzy, went on a killing spree
Caught him at that red light snoozin', he thought this shit was sweet
If he come from that other side, we make him rest in peace

They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em

Addicted to this ecstasy, I like how it feel
It's like I been poppin' X ever since I tried a pill
Shit got me through some hard times, I lost my mind for real
Lot of shit happened way too fast, I ain't have time to heal
Ed was gon' make it on that court but he died in the field
I was still hangin' in the hood before I signed a deal
Posted on Hudson, jakes ridin' past, I had my nine concealed
Hot 'nem do no talking, they just spark shit when it's time to drill
Lil Stank so reckless, he ride fast when he behind the wheel

I won't forget 'bout that lil' shit you said, we gon' get you for frontin' your move
My shootas some hell-raisers, come through clappin' broad, they don't give a fuck 'bout the rules
I played the block, went on them drills by my lonely, I had the four-oh up in school
Fightin' anxiety so I kept spendin' my last on all of the drugs I abuse

Well respected in this hip-hop, lil' Polo be spittin' facts
A lot of rappers doin' way more stuntin' than givin' back
You ain't my color, then you don’t know the struggle of livin' black
Cops kill us and we protest, what type of shit is that?
Man, if the police shoot at one of my brothers, I'm blickin' back
We hate each other, so we just wanna score and go tit-for-tat
All these shorties want is points, they ain't chasin' a different stat
Really riskin' it all, what’s the point when that nigga rat?
We seventeen, got forty years in that court when we gettin' cracked
Stuck in the system, they just watchin' us fail while they sittin' back
The government cuttin' checks, but can't cut a nigga some slack
It's hard to get a job, so we hustle and flip a pack
It's all a set-up, no wonder why they call this bitch a trap
Life was messed up, a matter of time 'til that nigga snap
Post-traumatic stress, so them triggers keep gettin' tapped
R.I.P. Malcolm, I promise to conquer and fill them gaps
Them corners leave a nigga boxed in, tryna break free
Crazy how I love the same block that tried to break me
Pray that I ain't in my own hood when they take me
This all we know, a life of peace what we can't see
I'm from where we unheard and we can't speak
We go to school, they try to tell us what we can't be
Profit with a billion-dollar mind like I'm JAY-Z
They killed Martin for dreamin' and now I can't sleep
Why would the devil take my brother if he close to me?
Now if you stare into my soul, you'll see my bros in me
We missin' you, man, this ain't how this shit supposed to be
Feel like I'm stuck, I wish them streets never proposed to me
Out there posted in the field with them soldiers deep
So now the other side wanna put a hole in me
Like every day might be the end of the road for me
We die young, so I couldn't picture a older me
Fightin' demons, let them drugs take control of me
All in my head, go and kill what they told to me
'Member we ain't have a thing, same clothes for weeks
Hardbody, that's how them situations molded me
Needed money and grew accustomed to this fast life
Pressure from this way of livin', so we blast pipes
Shit got me stressin' three hundred and sixty-five nights
Them people workin' against us like we don't have rights
It don't matter what this money and this fame can give
I've been hurtin', tryna smile through the pain and tears
Wish we could go back to them days when we played as kids

Don't say you smokin' on my niggas (Nah), 'cause that be your last spliff (Bitch)
Hitter with me, he do mad hits (Ayy)
Turned my bitch into a bad bitch
Dropped a song and I got mad lit
All I did was give 'em ad-libs, ayy, ayy, ayy
Too rough, we know how to play, uh
I did a show, that's out of state (Ayy)
I make them bitches go out of they way, Fivi

[Chorus: Pop Smoke, Fivio Foreign, & Both]
Look (Woo)
I'm downtown Chicago, on Michigan Ave with Polo and we on some woo shit (Woo shit, lil' bitch)
I walk into Saks Fifth with a bad bitch and we both feelin' ruthless (Ruthless, ayy, ayy)
If I see a opp in the spot, I look him in his face like, "You ain't gon' do shit" (Nah)
Saucin' (Saucin'), too lit (Too lit)
Headshot (Headshot), clueless (Clueless, boaw)

Fivi (Fivi), uh (Uh), she saw me and started droolin' (Woo, she did)
Big dope (Big dope), boofin' (Boofin')

[Verse 2: Polo G & Fivio Foreign]
I just took a jet from the 'Raq in New York with the gang and we on some woo shit (Woo)
And we really outside and my crew lit
We too deep, ain't nobody gon' do shit (Lil' bitch)
If it's a problem, my young nigga shoot shit (Ayy)
Stakin' out like a date up in Ruth Chris (Ayy)
In the field, we took more than a few risks (We did)
Mike Amiri jeans full of blue strips (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I might get frostbite, all this ice on me, tell 'em, "Stitch me a new wrist" (Lil' bitch)
I just dropped ten racks up at Louis, I spent like a band on my new kicks (Lil' bitch)
Make a hater throw up 'cause my coupe sick (Ayy)
I can't fuck on that ho 'cause I'm too rich (Ayy)
Make a hater throw up 'cause my coupe sick
I can't fuck on that ho 'cause I'm too rich (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Ay, ay, ay, ay
A-Apollo did it

[Chorus]
This shit left me shell shocked and traumatized (Shell shocked and traumatized)
It's hard to speak on what I'm feeling up inside (I'm feeling up inside)
I can't even look my mama in her eyes (Look my mama in her eyes)
I put you through so much and I apologize (I apologize)
I'm cashing checks I hope these hunnids stop the crying (Stop the crying)
Where I'm from they only love you when you die (When you die)
I'm from the trenches where we fighting to survive (To survive)
Can't be another victim of these homicides
[Verse 1]
And you can't even show too much love, or they get greedy
The same niggas ain’t give a fuck, saying don't leave me
For my niggas I wrote this one in blood, I know you see me
It ain't no turning back they went too far so fuck a treaty
Phone on airplane mode, I'm too high up for you to reach me
I been too busy chasing my dreams, I'm never sleepy
Catch us at the awards like look mama I'm on TV
I'm just tryna make my mark in this shit, like Pac or Weezy
I can tell by the look in your eyes, you probably need me
But it's a lot of girls that's attractive, what can you teach me?
And is you gon' stick around or say fuck me when this ain't easy?
It be the ones that you least expected, I swear this shit it get greasy

[Chorus]
This shit left me shell shocked and traumatized (Shell shocked and traumatized)
It's hard to speak on what I'm feeling up inside (I'm feeling up inside)
I can't even look my mama in her eyes (Look my mama in her eyes)
I put you through so much and I apologize (I apologize)
I'm cashing checks I hope these hunnids stop the crying (Stop the crying)
Where I'm from they only love you when you die (When you die)
I'm from the trenches where we fighting to survive (To survive)
Can't be another victim of these homicides

[Verse 2]
My lil' niggas some demons, they be quick to let it spark
We was shorties on the block, we wasn't playing in the park
Granny say whatever you do, just play it smart
I keep getting tatted, just to cover up the scars
I'm just tryna shine and fight my way up out the dark
We like royalty, kings is what we are
I just plan on chasing my dreams and going far
Gotta think big if you plan on living large
Tryna look on Billboard and see my name up on them charts
I walk up in the stu' and put my soul in every bar
Whole team gotta eat, we filling up the shopping cart
And you can't grab a plate if you weren't right here from the start

This shit left me shell shocked and traumatized (Shell shocked and traumatized)
It's hard to speak on what I'm feeling up inside (I'm feeling up inside)
I can't even look my mama in her eyes (Look my mama in her eyes)
I put you through so much and I apologize (I apologize)
I'm cashing checks I hope these hunnids stop the crying (Stop the crying)
Where I'm from they only love you when you die (When you die)
I'm from the trenches where we fighting to survive (To survive)
Can't be another victim of these homicides15Embed
