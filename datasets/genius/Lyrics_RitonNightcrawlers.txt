TranslationsDeutschFriday (Dopamine Re-Edit) Lyrics[Intro: Hypeman, (Mufasa), John Reid]
Mufasa (Hmm?)
You know we finally here, right? (Where are we?)
It's Friday then
Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
Learn, their lives again
It's Friday then
Learn, their lives to pull us
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
Learn, their lives again
It's Friday
Learn, their lives to pull us
It's Saturday, Sunday
[Chorus: Samantha Harper]
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again, -gain, -ain, -ain

[Verse 1: Samantha Harper]
I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this by now, yeah
It's been too long since we got crazy
I'm lowkey spinnin' out
I'm countin' down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know I'm all in my bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah

[Chorus: Samantha Harper, Mufasa, Hypeman]
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
(We want that weekend)
It's Friday again (Oh)
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
(We want that weekend)
It's Friday again
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
