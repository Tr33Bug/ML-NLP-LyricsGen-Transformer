Heart On Ice Lyrics[Intro]
SpeakerBangerz
Look, uh, look

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
"I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier"
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah
[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

To tell you that you crossed my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long so I should just say bye, but

It's safe to say I been this way since I was eighteen
The same night I fall in love, I feel it fading
Who can you love, who can you trust now that you're mainstream?
Don't want no love, don't got no trust, I feel me changin' (Yeah)
Sometimes I think about my high school sweetheart (Oh-oh-oh)
But times change, people change and grow apart
I fell so hard and fast for Dee, I wanna start a family (Family)
She show resentment, she got pregnant, and she felt abandoned (Oh-oh-oh)
That shit with what's-her-namе was faster than I had planned it (Oh-oh-oh)
She movеd away from San Diego, livin' in Miami (Miami)
We caught a flight to Puerto Rico, she was sweet as candy (Candy)
She just ain't know she had my heart before the plane landed (Yeah)
And by the time I got home (Oh-oh-oh), I just wanted to be alone
I met Brianna through Kearra, they were the best of friends (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
She turned her head, and we moved up just like the Jeffersons (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I need your all each and every day (Oh), if I can't then I'll fade
And I don't mean to rush, but I easily fall in love (Yeah)
Uh, in my head I know that that ain't right
But I believe in first sight, yeah
We can fall in love right here tonight

She told me she'd love me and I told her that I'd do the same
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name

Remember when I had first met you how I used to sweat you
I used to call your phone and text you and tell you you're special
Like girl, you're special, you the kinda girl that I need
I actually made you mine, sometimes, I can't believe
Wonder what your nigga was thinking when he let you leave
You try to leave, I might get down on my hands and knees
I'm still a G, please believe, but girl, you make me weak
You make me feel something I never felt, the reason I never left
A lot of hoes want your position, but they tripping

I know what I did, I need you to bear with me
I know shit get ugly, but that's why you pretty
And pushin' a Bentley, my kind near extinct
I put up them millions, I'll never go broke
I'm a god in my hood, I give everyone hope
Can't remember a time when my answer was nope
I remember the times I had nowhere to go
Down to my lowest, I turned to a pro
And I'm pourin' my heart out, I bought my lil' boy house
I brought all the bros out, I never try show out
I'm never gon' go out, never that
Every time that I turn around, I'm giving back
Once they whack him, he's dead, it ain't no gettin' back

Heart been broke so many times, and I can't take it back

I done took lies straight to the face, been stabbed in my back
I done been crossed by my closest people, can't blame you for that
Last bitch told me that she love me, couldn't stand on that
Told me that she would never leave me, then her bags was packed
So I guess you can take that story, say I'm traumatized
They say I look just like my dad with my mama's eyes
They say our future's like my father with my mama's pride
'Cause if I ever kiss that Cupid, it's a homicide
I was tryna lock up my heart and throw away the key
But somehow, you made the key take control of me
I told myself never again would I ever fall
But when I see those pretty eyes, I wanna risk it all

I fell straight on my face, I'll take the blame for that
Heart been broke so many times, and I can't take it back

Late at night, I ain't sleeping, I'm up thinking (I'm up thinking)
I'ma ball all season for last season (Yeah, yeah)
Back when I was on the bleachers, they left me needin' (Yeah)
Thug life ain't dead, niggas scared, that's how I feel (I feel)
I don't fuck with my peers, never did, and never will (I never will)
And I can't keep a bitch 'cause I be peepin' shit
I ain't with all of that beefin' shit, I'd rather leave a bitch
In the city, brought my glizzy with me, I'll delete a bitch
Niggas hating on a daily, but be on some feature shit, leecher shit
Niggas mad at me but I can't understand 'em
How you mad at me and I'm tryna feed my family?
And my school didn't feel like high school 'cause niggas fake
So I would skip classes and break in houses to get paid
Told my mama one day, one day, I'ma be straight
Stack up my chips and I'ma move far away

[Chorus]
Weight of the world on your shoulders and you're feeling all alone
You got it, my nigga, just hold on
Thug life ain't dead, I'ma be this way until they kill me
'Til then, I'ma make these niggas feel me
My nigga it's a wild, wild lifestyle
A wild, wild lifestyle
I don't get along with my peers, I'm at war with myself
So fuck you and everybody else

Four in the mornin', while they sleepin', I'm wide awake
Thinkin' about the problems I faced, make my heart race
I done put my trust in so many, they all traded lanes
I don't know where I should start but it's time for a change
During the day, I'm Rod Wave, but I feel like Cobain
Do I wanna deal with the pain that tomorrow brings?
Might grab a gun, blow out his brain, he been feelin' strange
But then he think 'bout Reginae and think about Charmaine
So many smiles, so many hugs, but I still feel alone
Cut down the lights, cut off his phone, and get in his zone
Lost in his thoughts, he's in a vault, but his mind, it roams
And he'll give his heart to anyone who will call it home
And he's been like that for so long, since a small child
He'd be okay until he sober, then his thoughts pile
They be on social sites ridin', clownin' a nigga
Then he remember he's up two, three hundred thousand on niggas (Krrah)

To whom it may concern, or, dear future owner
I have this heart but I can't control it
It loves what it loves, it does what it wanna
Tried to lock it up, but it jumped back on my shoulder
Don't get me wrong, it's a good heart and it's golden
But it's been stolen, on top of that, it's been broken
Drug through the mud, it's driving me insane
Tryna spread love, pickin' fights with my brain
Don't want it literally, so over it mentally
So tired physically, it distracts and hinders me
So it's for sale, the best offer gets the box
Gift from my mother but a curse from my pops
Kinda hurts when it locks but I'll get better
Right now I'm tryna focus on putting it back together
After I'm done, you can come pick it up whenever
So I can focus on gettin' back to the cheddar, I swear it's
[Chorus]
It's always in the wrong hands
I don't think I'll use it again
I would do the faith thing and give it a try
But if it stay, it'll take over my mind
I've got a heart for sale, I don't need it
I've got a heart for sale and it's bleeding
I've got a heart for sale, you can keep it
I've got a heart for sale
It's always in the wrong hands
I don't think I'll use it again
I would do the faith thing and give it a try
But if it stay, it'll take over my mind
