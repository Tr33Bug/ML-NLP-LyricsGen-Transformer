Girls just wanna have fun
So they party, so they party

She like to do drugs too, she in love with guns too
They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you
Lil' mama a party girl, she just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type, but I don't care, I want you

They say you too piped up, but I think that I love you (Let's go)
[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Ever since I wifed you (Yeah)
They said that's a no-no (No)
Suck it 'til her throat close
Pull up Lam', no slowpoke (Skrrt)
Pull up a Phantom, that's Rolls on Rolls (Skrrt)
I fuck this bitch and I skrrt off the road (Woah)
She said that she know me from somewhere before
But I think she want me because my dough (Yeah)
I don't think they like me
There's blood on my white tee (Ayy)
I don't usually party (Yeah)
But this X pilly got me (Ooh, woah)
Baby, let's go outer space
Teach you how to sightsee
She suck it like a Hi-C
I don't even judge you, so they can't top me

Lil' mama a party girl (Yeah), she just wan' have fun too (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They say you ain't wifey type (What?), but I don't care, I want you (You)
She like to do drugs too (Yeah), she in love with guns too (What?)
They say you too piped up (Huh?), but I think that I love you

[Verse 2: StaySolidRocky]
She drinkin' Four Lokos, I can't get with those
She wan' give me toto, I tell her come close
She say, "You say you love me, but I don't know what love means"
I ask her who got her heart, 'cause damn, that nigga lucky
I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
