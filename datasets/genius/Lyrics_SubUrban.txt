I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep

I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world’s so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
[Verse 2]
Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
Why can’t you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me

[Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush

[Verse 3]
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one-way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music 'til the wick burns out
Hush

I'm stimulated, overstated, I just wanna get sedated
On the contrary, I just wanna meet a nice girl
Messy, not too sketchy, keep me tied up in the right world
Segregated, situated, hangin' on sophisticated
Liberated, nauseated, I just want more medication
Individuality and blue light gives me headaches

Feathers plucked from flight (Just to torture yourself)
And she sunk right through the ground

Most times I feel like they know more than me
They just might, just might, just might

When I talk, talk I don't ever talk, talk, talk
When you talk, talk, you can't help but talk, talk, talk
When you knock, knock you just never knock, knock
(I'm so happy for you, I'm so happy for you)

[Chorus: Sub Urban]
Lock all my friends up in the asylum
When they all come back, they all just reset
That's why I won't go, when I'm arraigned, no
And I won't plead crazy, I know they can't change me3Embed TranslationsPortuguêsSub Urban - HEDON (中文翻译)HEDON Lyrics[Intro]
Swerving in the Countach, I'm flying
Got no license, always had my own driver
I'm running all the red lights, I'm finally
Feeling something that I never felt prior

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
You want more life, meet this friend of mine
Drop your acolytes, yeah, show us a good time
You want more life, meet this friend of mine
Drop your acolytes, yeah, show us a good time

Chug, chug, chug
Harvest that blood, blood, blood
It feels so good, good, good
You know you would, would, would

[Outro]
I don't wanna have self-control
I would rather feel something new than not feel at all
I don't think that I could recall
Was I always this tired? Has my high expired? Oh
I don't wanna have self-control

Wanna drown my life out without noises
Bottled poisons and flicker in my ears
Now all I hear are voices, such hopeless voices
That I can't stay here for long
Or just die while I'm young
Like a stranger that crashes and burns
I'll just bite on this gun
I'll just lean on this thumb
I'll just hurt until I can't hurt no more
[Post-Chorus]
Shit-talk, people staring at my dunce cap
Choirs singing nothing but the greenest trap
Who says that I gotta wear a suit tie?
Who says that I gotta have an alibi?

[Verse 1]
Please help me, God just wants to paint me blue
No love, just silhouettes who don't come through
Faint talent, disappointing everyone
When rain clouds are more present then I gotta sing

[Instrumental Drop]

[Verse 2]
Paint the thoughts onto my head day and night
If I've made the wrong choices all of my life
Scribbling nonsenses on my walls
Living in fear of falling too far but
I can't stay behind bars

[Chorus]
Wanna drown my life out without noises
Bottled poisons and flicker in my ears
Now all I hear are voices, such hopeless voices
That I can't stay here for long
Or just die while I'm young
Like a stranger that crashes and burns
I'll just bite on this gun
I'll just lean on this thumb
I'll just hurt until I can't hurt no more

[Verse 3]
Rain down, wasn't showing anyway
Clock broke, I can't tell the night from day
Past gone, living like I'm living large
Make a toast to the slow lane

[Chorus]
Forward
I'm falling forward
I'm dragging her words
I'm falling forward
And I must start there

[Verse 1]
You're wasting all of your time with those bad thoughts
Fall apart, sick, gonna be in the cobwebs
Leave your past, the pass we met, yeah
Sitting in the hallway, screaming in the hallway
I'm feeling it, though my better off
I must have been feeling good
You're gorgeous, go and sing it now
We gon' finally back down
[Refrain]
You're wasting all your damn time, young sentimental
Erasing all the whole night
You're some type you're chasing whole the emotions
Because you're sometimes, 'cause you're sometimes—
You're wasting all your damn time, young sentimental
Erasing all the whole night
You're some type you're chasing whole the emotions
Because you're sometimes, 'cause you're sometimes...

I'm dragging her words
I'm falling forward
And I must start there

Here in my room 'til mortality
My body freezes shut, because is cool can’t breathe

Break every single, burning 'cause you're calling, yeah
