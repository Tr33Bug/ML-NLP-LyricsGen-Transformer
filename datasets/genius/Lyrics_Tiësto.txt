I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah
[Verse 1]
You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
'Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2]
You are a catch-22, either way I miss out
All of the grief I give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted

Blacked out
Everything faded on your love
I’m already wasted so close
That I can taste it now, now
So let’s break right out of these gilded cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around
Don’t ever turn around

[Chorus]
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
[Verse 2]
White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can’t ignore
We can’t back down
We’ll never let them change us
We’re going to make it now
What are we waiting for...
What are we waiting for...

[Chorus]
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go

You can travel the world
But you can't run away
From the person you are in your heart
You can be who you want to be

Keep all your light in the dark
If you're searching for truth
You must look in the mirror
And make sense of what you can see
Just be
Just be
[Verse 2]
They say learning to love yourself
Is the first step
That you take when you want to be real
And flying on planes to exotic locations
Won't teach you
How you really feel
Face up to the fact
That you are who you are
And nothing can change that belief
Just be
Just be

Cause now I know
It's not so far
To where I go
The hardest part
Is inside me

To just be
