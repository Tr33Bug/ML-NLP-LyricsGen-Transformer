(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Uh, huh-huh
Ohhh yeah
Work, work

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me
"Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees"
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, maybe
And now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh
[Pre-Chorus]

Somebody tell me, oh (Won't you tell me?)
Why I work so hard for you?
(Give you money, work to give you money)
Oh

[Verse 2]
Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Then how can it be good enough for two?

Every day I hear a different story
People sayin' that you’re no good for me
Saw your lover with another
And she’s making a fool of you, oh

But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me I’m a baby, and I don't understand

But you know that I’ll forgive you
Just this once, twice, forever!
‘Cause baby
You could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we’re together, and you do

Where membership's a smiling face
Brush shoulders with the stars
Where strangers take you by the hand
And welcome you to wonderland
From beneath their panamas

All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan

Then kiss in Tropicana's heat
Watch the waves break on the bay
Oh, soft white sands, a blue lagoon
Cocktail time, a summer's tune
A whole night's holiday

Job or no job, you can’t tell me that I’m not
Do you enjoy what you do?
If not, just stop
Don’t stay there and rot

[Bridge]
If you’re a pub man or a club man
Maybe a jet black guy with a hip hi-fi
A white cool cat with a trilby hat
Maybe leather and studs is where you’re at
Make the most of every day
Don’t let hard times stand in your way
Give a wham, give a bam but don’t give a damn
‘Cause the benefit gang are gonna pay
[Verse 3]
Now reach up high and touch your soul
The boys from Wham! will help you reach that goal
It’s gonna break your mama’s heart (So sad)
It’s gonna break your daddy’s heart (Too bad)
But you’ll throw the dice and take my advice
Because I know that you’re smart
Can you dig this thing? (Yeah!)
Are you gonna get down? (Yeah!)
Say wham! (Wham!)
Say bam! (Bam!)

[Chorus]
Wham, bam!

Job or no job, you can’t tell me that I’m not
Do you enjoy what you do?
If not, just stop

Hey sucker
(What the hell's got into you?)
Hey sucker
(Now there's nothing you can do)

[Verse 1]
Well I hadn't seen your face around town awhile
So I greeted you, with a knowing smile
When I saw that girl upon your arm
I knew she won your heart with a fatal charm
I said "Soul boy, let's hit the town"
I said "Hey boy, what's with the frown?"
But in return, all you could say was
"Hi George, meet my fiancee"
[Chorus]
Young guns having some fun
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties
See me, single and free
No tears, no fears, what I want to be

Sleepless nights, on an H.P. bed

Well there's guys like you just everywhere
Looking back on the good old days?
Well this young gun says caution pays

In unlit alleyways
By the church downtown
Where Sally prays
Come down sometime
We'll share a rusty can of corn, yeah
And listen to the radio
"I love you, I love you", it says
Where did your heart go?
Did you put it on a train?
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico?
Where did your heart go?
Did you put it on a train?
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico?
You cried but I don't know how
I've heard it all before
There it goes again
The slamming of the door
Sometimes the river calls me
And at night it calls my name
Says, ''Put your troubles down beside me''
Things have always been the same
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me
What the river said that night
I jumped into this beauty
And drifted out of sight
Where did your heart go?
Did you put it on a train?
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico?
Where did your heart go?
Did you put it on a train?
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico?You might also likeEmbed Bad Boys Lyrics[Intro]

Dear mommy, dear daddy
You had plans for me, oh yeah
I was your only son
And long before this baby boy
Could count to three

No child of mine grows up a fool
Run along to school
When you tried to tell me what to do
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you
One thing that I know for sure

You look as if you had a fight
Where were you last night?
Well I think that you may just be right
But don’t try to keep me in tonight
Because I’m big enough to break down the door

Another summer, another vacation is over
It’s September now with the sun and the smell of the clover
Down by the gate, we sit and watch all our friends go by
And pretend we don’t hear the bell
That rings through the summer sky

I was happy with the kisses she gave me
It’s just that happy was all she made me
Happy that was, until I saw you

Heartbeat, heartbeat
What do you bear me now?
Oh, you hurt me, desert me, in my darkest hour
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Why do you keep me here?
How could I help but admire her beauty
Standing on the line between desire and duty
Heartbeat, heartbeat
It’ll end in tears, oh

[Verse 2]
I need a lover, when love’s such dangerous place to be
Oh, if we were meant for each other
Then why don’t you answer me?
Don’t keep me waiting, you know I long to be by your side
We could even be together, tonight

I was happy with the kisses she gave me
But now there’s nothing on Earth to save me
Why should I care? I can’t have you, oh whoa

"Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees"

Well you've shown me you can take
You've got some giving to do

But one step further, and my back will break

I watch you breathe, I can not sleep
I touch your hair, I kiss your skin
And hope the morning sun won’t wake you too soon
For when you wake and look at me
You never know, you just might see
Another boy who crept into your room
Take your time, that’s what you told me
Take your time
But I fell head first and I just don’t know what to do

Nothing looks the same in the light
Only a fool like me would take to heart
The things you said you meant last night
Nothing looks the same in the light

With a warm hand, then a kiss so right
Nothing looks the same in the light
It’s been a pleasure, see you around

I watch the sun upon the sheets
I hear a car out on the street
And gently pull you close, it’s over too soon

They’ve blinded me to empty charms
I crossed the ocean
Fell into your arms
So sure, so wrong
You sang me a simple tune
I took it for a song

I’d love to love you, really love you but you see
There’s something you should know
I really didn’t think you’d go

[Chorus]
Because today
I could have sworn I heard you say
“I love you, I want you, I need to be with you”
Today, I saw something in your face
