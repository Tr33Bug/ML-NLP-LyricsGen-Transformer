Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time
[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind

And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind

I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, "It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye"
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind

I just caught some time, I'll be home soon
It won't be long, I promise
I will be okay, just wipe those
Tears off of your face, I'm sorry
I won't right my wrongs, I'm guilty
Lord, have mercy, please forgive me
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry
[Verse 1]
One hundred and forty-five days, I'm counting
Tryna hold on but the time goes slowly
Two hundred and twenty-five ice cold showers
Hurricane hit my cell, ain't get no power
Tryna walk a narrow straight path is a battle
Kinda hard to walk when you're chained in shackles
My soul bleeds through these four walls
My heart aches after phone calls

[Chorus]
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry
I just caught some time, I'll be home soon
It won't be long, I promise
I will be okay, just wipe those
Tears off of your face, I'm sorry
I won't right my wrongs, I'm guilty
Lord, have mercy, please forgive me
Mama, please don't you cry, I'm sorry

Give you my heart that's filled with pain, give me my freedom
Take off these shackles, they hurt my hands, let me go home

Uh, uh
Go on then bend it over, ooh
She obedient, she do what I told her
[Chorus]
Girl, I wanna fuck with you
Girl, I wanna fuck with you
I think I'm catching feelings
I don't know what to do
Girl, I'm tryna fuck with you
Girl, I wanna fuck with you
I think I'm catching feelings
You got me so confused
Girl, I wanna fuck with you
Girl, I wanna fuck with you
I think I'm catching feelings
I don't know what to do
Girl, I'm tryna fuck with you
Girl, I wanna fuck with you
I think I'm catching feelings
You got me so confused

[Verse 2]
I'm so confused
Make love to me
If you go or die
Keep in touch with me
The way you wear your hair is because of me
So, why you never ever show no love to me
Don't say a word, just get on top and make sweet love to me
Ooh, I know, I know you fuck with me
You know it's Melly baby, so go on and bend it over
Never met a real street nigga that's exactly what I told her
Uh, ooh, she from Atlanta, Georgia
You know my car don't run on keys, they run on Florida water
Bad hoes, superfine
So divine, just be mine
Ayy, ayy, oh no, if I'm catching feelings, do I let her go?
'Cause you know
I was feeling, I was feeling how I'm fucked up in this jam
Where the fuck you was at when I was locked up in the ground
Bitch, I don't know how to love, so teach me how
Bitch, you ain't shit to me, hit the door
(Bitch you green as fuck)
I can't fuck witcha no more
Damn, ha ha ha, you silly ho (Oh no)
That's why I know you slurp that dick like go on and bend it over
Stop playing with a nigga like me

Melly the menace
I got out my bag and I went and got me
Fucked up environment
That's what JGreen said, that's what he said, hey
She swallow that dick like a vitamin
Young nigga world
Melly the menace
Fucked up environment, hey

[Verse]
Bitch I'm a menace, I shoot on school premises, fuck the environment
Bitch I'm from Gifford, AKA the G, that's a fucked up environment
Tec got the decimal, three point fourteen, pussy boy ain't no pie in it
Chopper diminish your organs, your penance if you ever lie to me
Just like a jail we gon' sentence him, capture his soul and replenish him (oh oh oh)
Don't give no fuck 'bout a friend, and fuck that lil jit, I ain't kin to him (fuck that ho)
Wrap his up like salami, then chop his ass up, now we blendin' him
Cook his ass up, we gon' chemist him
Ooh, get at him
Scorpio move with the stick
We gon' catch his ass slippin' and then we gon' finish him
Break his ass down and diminish him
Don't give no fucks 'bout offendin' him
These hoes are just alike, I swear they got all of these bitches still synonym
Lil biddy bitch you an antonym
How in the fuck is you friends with them?
Bitch I'm a thug, not a gentleman
Swallow my dick like some cinnamon
Swallow my dick like some dinner man
Fuck Donald Trump and George Zimmerman
Fuck Donald Trump and George Zimmerman
Ooh, bitch ass nigga don't want no problems
[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm a menace, I shoot on school premises, fuck the environment
Glock on my waist, with your bitch in my face, I'm like fuck the society
You don't want beef, we pull up with them sticks and you gotta go fire him (fire that bitch)
I do not care what you talkin' about, all these bitches desire me
Taraji P. Henson, your bitch gon' Empire me
She suck on my neck and my dick, she vampire me
I fuck with JGreen 'cause I know he won't lie to me
I fuck with Sakchaser, I know he gon' ride for me
We hit a lick for ten bands, that shit like hittin' the lottery
We sendin' shots at your man, we do not send no apologies
I am so high in the sky, think I can study for astrology
Bitch ass nigga do not want no beef and he know that I'm straight out the pot with it
Oh, oh, straight out the pot with it
Oh, Jay Rich go out with Young Malo, yeah bitch I'm straight out the pot with it
JGreen won't stop, he keep on beatin' the pot
JGreen won't stop, he keep on beatin' the pot
Fuck is that young nigga talkin' 'bout, know that my Glock will demolish him
Pull up on him and we moppin' then wet his ass up then we polish him
Seen his ass all in public, must of thought that I was gon' say hi to him
I just pulled up, put that fire to him
You ridin' with him then you die with him
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, pull up and air it out
Location turned off, you don't know 'bout our whereabouts
These bitches opinions somethin' I don't care about
Traphouse boomin' hard, got the baseheads runnin' in and out
I was losing in the race, fuck nigga look who winnin' now
Run up the money, we run up the commas now
Givenchy steppin', Louis Ferragamo now (fuck up a check)
Don't fuck on these bitches, we fuck on these bitches' mamas nowYou might also like7Embed
