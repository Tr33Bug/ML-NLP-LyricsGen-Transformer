Moon River LyricsMoon river wider than a mile
Im crossing you in style some day
You dream maker you heart breaker
Wherever youre going Im going your way

Two drifters off to see the world
Theres such a lot of world to see
Were after the same rainbows end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river and me
Oh you dream maker you heart breaker
Wherever youre going Im going your way

Were after that same rainbows end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend
Moon river and me
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello
She gave new meaning to this empty world of mine
Thered never be another love another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart with very special things
With angels songs with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go Im never lonely
With her around who could be lonely
I reach for her handits always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know Ill need her till the stars all burn away
And shell be there

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know Ill need her till the stars all burn away
And shell be there
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you be of good cheer
Its the most wonderful time of the year

Its the haphappiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
Its the haphappiest season of all

Therell be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
Therell be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long long ago
Its the most wonderful time of the year
Therell be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near

So leave a peppermint stick for old St Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

Trying to forget my feelings of love
Teardrops rolling down on my face
Trying to forget my feelings of love

Feelings for all my life Ill feel it
I wish Ive never met you girl
Youll never come again

Feelings wo oh oh feelings
Wo oh oh feel you again in my arms
Feelings feelings like Ive never lost you
And feelings like Ive never have you again in my heart

Feelings for all my life Ill feel it
I wish Ive never met you girl
Youll never come again

And feelings like Ive never have you again in my life

Feelings wo oh oh feelings

Its the April rose that only grows in the early spring
Love is natures way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king

Once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing
Yes true loves a manysplendored thing
Oh once on a high and windy hill
In the morning mist two lovers kissed
And the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart
And taught it how to sing
Yes true loves a manysplendored thing
Speak softly love
And hold me warm against your heart
I feel your words
The tender trembling moments start
Were in a world our very own
Sharing a love that only few have ever known


Winecolored days warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one

Speak softly love
So no one hears us but the sky
The vows of love
We make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love so softly love


Winecolored days warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one


Speak softly love
So no one hears us but the sky
The vows of love we make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love so softly love
Guess Ill get dressed and do the town
Ill find some crowded avenue
Though it will be empty without you

Cant get used to losin you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you

Called up some girl I used to know
After I heard her say Hello
Couldnt think of anything to say
Since youre gone it happens every day
Cant get used to losin you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you

Ill find somebody wait and see
Who am I kiddin only me
Cause no one else could take your place
Guess that I am just a hopeless case

Cant get used to losin you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you

I cant get used to losin you
No matter what I try to do
Gonna live my whole life through
Loving you
Born free as free as the wind blows
As free as the grass grows
Born free to follow your heart


Live free and beauty surrounds you
The world still astounds you
Each time you look at the stars


Stay free where no walls divide you
Youre as free as the roaring tides
So theres no need to hide

Born free and life is worth living
But only worth living
Cause youre born free


 Stay free where no walls divide you 
Youre as free as the roaring tides
So theres no need to hide


Born free and life is worth living
But only worth living
Cause youre born free
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till youre back beside me till Im holding you
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms
Anywhere you wander anywhere you go
Every day remember how I love you so
In your heart believe what in my heart I know
That forevermore Ill wait for you
The clock will tick away the hours one by one
Then the time will come when all the waitings done
The time when you return and find me here and run
Straight to my waiting arms
If it takes forever I will wait for you
For a thousand summers I will wait for you
Till youre here beside me till Im touching you
And forevermore sharing your love
I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing Im on the street where you live


Are there lilac trees in the heart of town
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town
Does enchantment pour out of every door
No its just on the street where you live

And oh the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear


People stop and stare they dont bother me
For theres nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by I wont care if I
Can be here on the street where you live
Blue is my world since Im without you
Gray gray my life is gray
Cold is my heart since you went away

Red red my eyes are red
Crying for you alone in my bed
Green green my jealous heart
I doubted you and now were apart

When we met how the bright sun shone
Then love died now the rainbow is gone
Black black the nights Ive known
Longing for you so lost and alone
Gone gone the love we knew
Blue is my world now Im without you
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off you
Youd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off you


Pardon the way that I stare
Theres nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that its real
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off you

I love you baby and if its quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby dont bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that Ive found you stay
And let me love you baby
Let me love you


Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off you
Youd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off you


I love you baby and if its quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby dont bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby now that Ive found you stay
Oh pretty baby
Trust in me when I say
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built alas
On weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away
 Yesterday when I was young
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that wont be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for Yesterday
When I was Young
 Repeat
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest
To follow that star 
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march
Into hell for a heavenly cause

And I know if Ill only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will be peaceful and calm
When Im laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To fight the unbeatable foe
To reach the unreachable star
When chains are torn by courage born of a love thats free
A time when dreams so long denied
Can flourish as we unveil the love we now must hide

A time for us at last to see
A life worthwhile for you and me

And with our love through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm
A time for us some day therell be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me
For you and me

And with our love through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm
A time for us some day therell be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me

A world of shining hope for you and me
God gave this land to me
This brave and ancient land to me
And when the morning sun
Reveals her hills and plains
Then I see a land
Where children can run free
So take my hand
And walk this land with me
And walk this lovely land with me
Though I am just a man
When you are by my side
With the help of God
I know I can be strong
Though I am just a man
When you are by my side
With the help of God
I know I can be strong
To make this land our home
If I must fight Ill fight
To make this land our own
Until I die this land is mine
I feel your words the tender trembling moment start
Were in a world our very own
Sharing a love that only few have ever known

Wine colored days warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one

Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky
The vows of love we make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love so softly love
Wine colored days warmed by the sun
Deep velvet nights when we are one

Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky
The vows of love we make will live until we die
My life is yours and all because
You came into my world with love
So softly love
When chains are torn by courage born of a love thats free
A time when dreams so long denied
Can flourish as we unveil the love we now must hide

A time for us at last to see
A life worthwhile for you and me

And with our love through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm
A time for us some day therell be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me
For you and me

And with our love through tears and thorns
We will endure as we pass surely through every storm
A time for us some day therell be a new world
A world of shining hope for you and me

A world of shining hope for you and me
