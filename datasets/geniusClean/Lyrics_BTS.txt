So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight


Shoes on get up in the morn
Cup of milk lets rock and roll
King Kong kick the drum
Rolling on like a Rolling Stone

Jump up to the top LeBron

When your hearts just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like its wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling were just getting started


When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye eye eye
Then you say

Aint nothing that can stop how we move yeah
Lets break our plans
And live just like were golden
And roll in like were dancing fools

Cause when we fall we know how to land
Dont need to talk the talk just walk the walk tonight
Cause we dont need permission to dance
