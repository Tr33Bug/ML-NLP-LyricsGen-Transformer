Do They Know Its Christmas Lyrics
Its Christmas time
Theres no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade


And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time its hard
But when youre having fun


Theres a world outside your window
And its a world of dread and fear


Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears


And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom


Well tonight thank God its them
Instead of you


And there wont be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift theyll get this year is life  Oooh 
Where nothing ever grows no rain or rivers flow
Do they know its Christmas time at all


Heres to you


Raise a glass for everyone


Heres to them


Underneath that burning sun


Do they know its Christmas time at all


Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know its Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know its Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know its Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know its Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know its Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know its Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know its Christmas time again
