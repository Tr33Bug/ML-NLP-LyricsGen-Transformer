Feels like forever even if forevers tonight
Just lay with me waste this night away with me

Got me questioning what I think is important
I cant even lie think of you when Im with her
Look me in my eye tell me that you feel different
Drove two hours just to stay the night with you
Havent seen you in a year but I still get you
Hurts to see you laugh cause I know Ill fucking miss that
How could I forget that


You made me feel alive
Forget them other bitches I will put em to the side
Girls in LA couldnt be more dry
Youre so money baby you aint even have to try
Now Im runnin with you round East Lansing
Titos in your dorm were dancing
Its a quarter after three
Sayin everything we mean

Girl its hard to see me go so fast yeah I get that
Times that we have so wild cant forget that
Now Im on a flight in my feels thinkin bout you
Hope you know you fire fuck anyone who doubts you
Life out in Cali has been great Im committed
You the only thing that makes me wish things were different
I might fly you out get your ass on a oneway
If I had it my way


Girl youd be by my side
Forget them other bitches I will put em to the side
Girls in LA couldnt be more dry
Youre so money baby you aint even have to try
Now Im runnin with you round East Lansing
Titos in your dorm were dancing
Its a quarter after three
Sayin everything we mean


Maybe Im stuck in the past girl
Not willing to let it all go
You cant ignore the fact baby


You made me feel alive
Fuck them other bitches I will put em to the side
Shits so real baby look me in my eyes
Youre so money baby you aint even have to try
Now Im runnin with you round East Lansing
Titos in your dorm were dancing
Its a quarter after three
Sayin everything we mean


For a moment I was feeling like I had you
Didnt wanna leave I had to
Its a quarter after three
Saying everything we meanI think Im losing my mind
Trying to stay inside the lines
Its like Im running in place
How you keep staying the same
Baby I I guess Im something different
And Im okay with that
I cant fake no more smiles
That shit gon drive me mad
Im focused on the future
Dont care bout nothin else

Im better by myself
Im better by myself
I dont need no one else
Im better by myself
Myself


Dont wanna answer questions
Just want your company
Its all good on the surface
Show me whats underneath
Im not concerned with drama
I left that shit in school
Im more concerned with commas
Than keeping up with you
Keep that away from me
I put the Heisman up to bad energy
No empathy especially when the kid off Hennessy
Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee
Make the fool come out like Who is he
I mean Im trying to tell yall


Im better by myself
Im better by myself
I dont need no one else
Im better by myself
Myself


I dont know who to trust
These days everyones shady
Fool me once Im on my own
There is no second time baby
Thats the shit I dont like
Please no yes no maybes
What elseOne two three four


Hands on your body Im grabbin your ass
Enjoyin the moment cause life move too fast
Im lookin forward ignorin the past
These are the times that well laugh lookin back
Im gettin lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters Im wishin you well
This is my year man if you couldnt tell

This is our life and we livin it well

Im feelin it my heads where the ceilin is  Oh yeah 
This energy turns nights into memories  Oh yeah 
Count up the bands youve been workin all summer

And I deleted all your info
Cause I heard about the info
Always knew that youd be ruthless
But I never thought that you could do this oh

And the fuckedup part is I gave yall the intro
That was my dude whyd you gotta pick him though
I was selfish in the way that I acted
Now you doing things just to get a reaction


Yeah I wonder if hes there with you now fucking you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when hes with you
And do you feel no shame
Does he make you feel the same
Could we have got what we wanted
Oh if we had just been honest


Why cant we just be honest
If we had just been honest


Remember  yeah 
Late night smokin weed under star projectors
Looked in my eyes said Will this last forever
I think we both know what was up where this was goin
But the sex was too good we got caught up in the moment
Now you took my best friend and turn him into my opponent
Oh yeah yeah yeah


Did you forget that I gave yall the intro
That was my dude whyd you gotta pick him though
I was selfish in the way that I acted
I keep doing things just to get a reaction


Yeah I wonder if hes there with you now fucking you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when hes with you
And do you feel no shame
Does he make you feel the same
Could we have got what we wanted
