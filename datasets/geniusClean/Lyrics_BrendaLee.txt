Rockin Around The Christmas Tree Lyrics
Rockin around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later well have some pumpkin pie
And well do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing Lets be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rockin around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyones dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing Lets be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rockin around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyones dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
That I was such a fool
I didnt know love could be so cruel
Ohohohohohohohyes
You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that dont right
The wrong thats been done
Im sorry  Im sorry
So sorry  So sorry
Please accept my apology
But love is blind
And I was too blind to see
Ohohohohohohohyes
You tell me mistakes
Are part of being young
But that dont right
The wrong thats been done
Ohohohohohohohyes
Im sorry so sorry
Please accept my apology
But love was blind
And I was too blind to see
Sorry 
Whispering  Alright
My baby whispers in my ear
Ummm Sweet Nothins
He knows the things I like to hear
Ummm Sweet Nothins
Things he wouldnt tell
Nobody else
Secret baby
I keep them to myself
Sweet Nothins
Ummm Sweet Nothins
We walk along hand in hand
Ummm Sweet Nothins
Yeah we both understand
Ummm Sweet Nothins
Sittin in the classroom trying to read my book
My baby give me that special look
Sweet Nothins
Ummm Sweet Nothins
Ah sittin on my front porch
Ummm Sweet Nothins
Well do I love you of course
Ummm Sweet Nothins
Mama turned on the front porch light
Sayin Come here darlin thats enough for tonight
Sweet Nothins
Ummm Sweet Nothins
Sweet Nothins
If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me really love me
Let it happen I wont care
If it seems that everything is lost
I will smile and never count the cost
If you love me really love me
Let it happen
Darling I wont care
Shall I catch a shooting star
Shall I bring it where you are
If you want me to I will
You can set me any test
Ill do anything you ask
If youd only say you love me still
When at last our life on earth is through
I will share eternity with you
If you love me really love me
Let it happen I wont care
If you love me really love me
Let it happen darling I wont care
The plane is on the runway
And its right on time
Its been so long since he left me here
To make it on my own
And then he called
He said his life was empty and hes sorry now
Hes changed his mind
He tells me that he still loves me like he always did
And now hes coming home
And now I see him smiling
And hes waving as he steps upon the runway
Yes I can see him running now
And I can hear him calling out my name
The tears are falling in my eyes
Cause now I have to find a way to tell him
That I couldnt wait forever
And I made a new life with another man
Well here he comes the man I loved
But grew tired of waiting for
He stayed away
And I just couldnt stand to be alone
Ill never know just why he left me here
And I still love him so
But now its done
I couldnt wait forever and I wish I had
Cause now hes coming home
Yes here he comes yes here he comes
No I couldnt wait forever and I wish I had
Cause now hes  coming home
Well here he comes
Make me feel that you still love me if its just if its just for one more day
Break it to me gently so my tears my tears wont fall too fast
If you must go then go slowly
Let me love you till the last
The love we shared for oh so long is such a big part of me
If you must take your love away take it gradually
Oh ohbreak it break it to me gently
Give me time oh give me a little time to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer cause Ill never never love again
Cause Ill never love again
What are you doing
Oh dont you know
Dont you know youll be my ruin
Youve got me crying crying again
When will you let this heartache end
Emotions
You get me upset
Why make me remember what I wanna forget
Ive been lonely lonely too long
Emotions please leave me alone
You worry my days
Yes you torture my nights
Never a dream
No those dreams never turn out right
Emotions
Ah give me a break
Let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh cant you see what youre doing to me
Emotions please set me free
You worry my days
Oh you torture my nights
Never a dream
No those dreams never turn out right
Emotions
Ah give me a break
Oh let me forget that I made a mistake
Oh cant you see what youre doing to me
Emotions please set me free
Why does the sea rush to shore
Dont they know its the end of the world
cause you dont love me anymoreYes
Why do the birds go on singing
Why do the stars glow above
Dont they know its the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the mornin and I wonder
Why everythings the same as it was
I cant understand no
I cant understand
How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Dont they know its the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye
spoken 
Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
sung 
Dont they know its the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye
Goodbye
All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I dont hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart
No use in holding other hands
For Id be holding only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips
For Id be thinking just of your caress
All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I dont hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart
No other voice can say the words
My heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low
No other love can ever bring again
All alone am I ever since your goodbye
All alone with just the beat of my heart
People all around but I dont hear a sound
Just the lonely beating of my heart
Jingle bells swing and Jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the Jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell Jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in Jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle bell square
In the frosty air
What a bright time its the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time its a swell time
To go gliding in a onehorse sleigh
Giddy up Jingle horse pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a Jingle and beat
Thats the Jingle bell rock
What a bright time its the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time its a swell time
To go gliding in a onehorse sleigh
Giddy up Jingle horse pick up those feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in a Jingle and beat
Thats the Jingle bell
Thats the Jingle bell
Thats the Jingle bell rock
Maybe I didnt treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didnt love you
Quite as often as I should have
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didnt hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
Im so happy that your mine
If I made you feel second best
Well Im sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell tell me tell me that your sweet love hasnt died
Give to me give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind yeah
You were always on my mind
Alone so alone that I could cry
I want to be wanted  wanted 
Alone watching lovers passing by
I want to be wanted
When I am kissed
I want his lips to really kiss me
When were apart
I want his heart to really miss me
I want to know
He loves me so his eyes are misting
Thats the way I want to be loved
Alone just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted  wanted  right now
Not tomorrow but right now
I want to be wanted
I want someone
To share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know
Id love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone somewhere meant for me
Alone  Just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted  right now 
Not tomorrow but right now
I want to be wanted
I want someone
To share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know
Id love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone somewhere meant for me
Someone somewhere  Meant for me
Still though were far apart
I love you still
Still after all this time
Still your still on my mind
I love you still
Ive lost count of the hours
Ive lost track of the days
In fact Ive lost just about everything since youve went away
Everything that is except the memories you left me
Thats one thing that no one can mar
I dont know who your with
I dont even know where youve gone
My only hope that someday you might hear me sing this song
And youll know that its especially for you
Cause I love you no matter where you are
Still though you broke my heart
Still though were far apart
I love you still
Still after all this time
Still your still on my mind
And I I love you still
My friends think Im crazy and maybe I am
But Ive carried this torch just as long as I can
But someday you just might decide to come home
I want you to know Im still here
Still after all this time
Still your still on my mind
And I I love you still
Dont ever cry for me
This is goodbye for me
I know were through
Im Losing you
Love sang its song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because Im losing you
Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then one day like the tide you began to change
And you became a perfect stranger
Someone is holding you
Sharing the lips I knew
I cant believe its true
That I am losing you
I cant believe its true
That I am losing you
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is
Like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words darling kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for evermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love you
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for evermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true 
In other words I love you
I can feel the heartaches
Comin on strong
I can feel the teardrops the pain and the sorrow
Ever since youve been gone they been
Comin on strong
Pain come on in hello sorrow
I see youre back again
Teardrops glad you dropped by
Cause you can help drown my pride
And since youre here time seems just fine
To let you know that youre gonna be with me
Til I lose my mind
But youve been gone
Much too long and I can feel the heartaches
Comin on strong
Only thing you left me was misery for company
And memories of a love gone wrong that keep
Comin on strong Comin on strong
Comin on strong Comin on strong
Comin on strong Comin on strong
