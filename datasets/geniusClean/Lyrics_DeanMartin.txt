Baby Its Cold Outside Lyrics
I really cant stay  But baby its cold outside 
Ive got to go away  But baby its cold outside 
This evening has been  Been hoping that youd drop in 
So very nice  Ill hold your hands theyre just like ice 
My mother will start to worry  Beautiful whats your hurry 
My father will be pacing the floor  Listen to the fireplace roar 
So really Id better scurry  Beautiful please dont hurry 
But maybe just a half a drink more  Put some records on while I pour 
The neighbors might think  Baby its bad out there 
Say whats in this drink  No cabs to be had out there 
I wish I knew how  Your eyes are like starlight now 
To break this spell  Ill take your hat your hair looks swell 
I ought to say No no no sir  Mind if I move in closer 
At least Im gonna say that I tried  Whats the sense of hurtin my pride 
I really cant stay
Oh baby dont hold out 
Baby its cold outside
I simply must go  But baby its cold outside 
The answer is no  But baby its cold outside 
Your welcome has been  How lucky that you dropped in 
So nice and warm  Look out the window at the storm 
My sister will be suspicious  Gosh your lips look delicious 
My brother will be there at the door  Waves upon the tropical shore 
My maiden aunts mind is vicious  Gosh your lips are delicious 
But maybe just a cigarette more  Never such a blizzard before 
Ive gotta get home  But baby youd freeze out there 
Say lend me a coat  Its up to your knees out there 
Youve really been grand  I thrill when you touch my hand 
But dont you see  How can you do this thing to me 
Theres bound to be talk tomorrow  Think of my lifelong sorrow 
At least there will be plenty implied  If you got pneumonia and died 
I really cant stay
Get over that cold out 
Baby its cold
Baby its cold outside
In Napoli where love is king 
When boy meets girl 
Heres what they say 
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie thats amore
When the world seems to shine
Like youve had too much wine thats amore
Bells will ring tingalingaling
Tingalingaling and youll sing Vita bella
Hearts will play tippytippytay
Tippytippytay like a gay tarantella
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule thats amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet youre in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know youre not dreaming signore
Scusami but you see
Back in old Napoli thats amore
When the moon hits your eye 
Like a big pizza pie thats amore  Thats amore
When the world seems to shine 
Like youve had too much wine thats amore  Thats amore
Bells will ring tingalingaling 
Tingalingaling and youll sing Vita bella vita bella vita bella 
Hearts will play tippytippytay 
Tippytippytay like a gay tarantella  Lucky fella
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule thats amore  Thats amore 
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet youre in love
When you walk in a dream
But you know youre not dreaming signore
Scusami but you see
Back in old Napoli thats amore
Amore  Thats amoreOh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since weve no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Man it doesnt show signs of stopping
And Ive brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How Ill hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home Ill be warm
And the fire is slowly dying
And my dear were still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow and snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How Ill hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home Ill be warm
Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear were still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Cantare oh oh oh oh
Lets fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together well find
Volare oh oh
E cantare oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai pi
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi dimprovviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Volare oh oh
E cantare oh oh oh oh
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass
E volavo volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu s
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggi
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me
Volare oh oh
E cantare oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass
Dance with me make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear but my eyes will see only you
Only you have the magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth sway me now
You know how
Sway me smooth sway me now
A boy went back to Napoli
Because he missed the scenery
The native dances and the charming songs
But wait a minute

Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now
Everybody finds somebody someplace
Theres no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here
If I had it in my power
Id arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you
If I had it in my power
I would arrange for every girl to have your charms
Then every minute every hour
Every boy would find what I found in your arms
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you
Everybody loves somebody sometime 
How lucky can one guy be
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said Aint that a kick in the head
The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said quote Aint that a hole in the boat
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful
Ive sunshine enough to spread
Its just like the fella said
Tell me quick aint love like a kick in the head
Like the fella once said Aint love like a kick in the head
Like the sailor said quote Aint that a hole in the boat
My head keeps spinning
I go to sleep and keep grinning
If this is just the beginning
My life is gonna be beautiful
Shes telling me well be wed
Shes picked out a king size bed
I couldnt feel any better or Id be sick
Tell me quick oh aint love a kick
Tell me quick aint love a kick in the head
Como e bella ce la luna brille e strette
Strette como e tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma
Down each avenue or via street or strata
You can see em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take em for espresso
Yeah I guess so
On each lovers arm a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma
Though theres grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and thats one too few
On an evening in Roma
Dont know what the countrys coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma
Como e bella ce la luna brille e strette
Strette como e tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma
Dont know what the countrys coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma
Sotter celo de Roma
On an evening in Roma
Side by side
Oh we aint got a barrel of money
Maybe were ragged and funny
But well travel along singing a song
Side by side
We dont know whats coming tomorrow
Maybe its trouble and sorrow
But well travel the road sharing our load
Side by side
Through all kinds of weather
What if the sky should fall
As long as were together
It doesnt matter at all
When theyve all had their quarrels and parted
Well be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side
When theyve all had their quarrels and parted
Well be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side
Side by side

Its a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
Its time for play its a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year around
Those marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head
Its shining so your nose wont freeze
Oh the world is your snowball see how it grows
Thats how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get up and roll it along
Oh its a yum yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
Its a sugar date but if spring is late
In winter its a marshmallow world
Its a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
Its time for play its a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year around
Those marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin head
Its shining so your nose wont freeze
Oh the world is your snowball see how it grows
Thats how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get up and roll it along
Its a yum yum world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
Its a sugar date but if spring is late
In winter its a marshmallow world

Rudolph the RedNosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Wont you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the RedNosed Reindeer
Youll go down in history

Blue moon you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold

When I looked to the moon it turned to gold
Blue moon now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon now Im no longer alone
