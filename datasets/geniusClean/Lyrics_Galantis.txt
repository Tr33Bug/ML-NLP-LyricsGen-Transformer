Peanut Butter Jelly Lyrics
Sleepless nights at the Chateau

YouI met you in a bar in San Francisco
Said you used to have a car before the repo
Smoking Lucky cigarettes I think the smoke went to my head
And now that summer night plays on repeat
We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
Im kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I wont forget San Francisco
No I know I wont forget I know I wont forget
I know I wont forget that night in San Francisco
In San Francisco
In San Francisco
I met you in a bar in San Francisco
But when the sun came up we had to let go
When you took that Greyhound bus
Thought it was the end of us
But now youre all I dream of when I sleep
We climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide
And played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times
Im kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life
But I know I wont forget San Francisco
No I know I wont forget I know I wont forget
I know I wont forget that night in San Francisco
In San Francisco
In San Fran
In San Francisco
In San Fran in San Fran in San Francisco
I cant get down
Down from this high  High 
High as a waterfall
If hearts could fly  Fly 
Want you to breathe  Breathe 
Breathe next to me
Caught in this lullaby
Sing it to me
I wanna drown in your holy water
You know a sin never felt so good
I wanna drown in your holy water
AAmen  AAmen AAmen 
I wanna drown in your holy water
You know a sin never felt so
Im all shook up
Shook up on you  You 
We burn like fireflies
Burn baby blue
Cause Im so deep  Deep 
Deep into you  Into you 
You are my church tonight
My holy view
I wanna drown in your holy water
You know a sin never felt so good
I wanna drown in your holy water
AAmen  AAmen 
I wanna drown in your holy water
You know a sin never felt so good
I wanna drown in your holy water  AAmen 
You know a sin never felt so

Too contradicted to figure out
I didnt expect to want all the things I could live without
I wouldnt do it for anyone you should know that
But since I loved you since 21 you should know that
When the wild comes calling on you help is on the way
And the high gets horny for you help is on the way
On the way help is on the way
When your heart dont bleed the way it used to
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
At first I didnt see through
All noise that I could care less about
I didnt expect to want all the things I could live without
I wouldnt do it for anyone you should know that
But since I loved you since 21 you should know that
When the wild comes calling on you help is on the way
And the high gets horny for you help is on the way
On the way help is on the way
When your heart dont bleed the way it used to
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Are you the one from my side of town maybe maybe
Its hard breathing in its hard breathing out lately lately
Louder harder better
As good as it ever gets
Are you the one from my side of town maybe maybe
Its something you want as wrong as it is lately lately lately lately
Louder harder better
As good as it ever gets
Wilder deeper better
As good as it ever gets
Louder harder better
As good as it ever gets
Are you the one from my side of town maybe maybe
Its hard breathing in its hard breathing out lately lately
Louder harder better
As good as it ever gets
When pillow talks turn to pillow fights
Remember before you say goodnight
To make up before you go to sleep
So pillow fights turn to pillow dreams
Ill go to sleep
Ill go to sleep tomorrow
Ill go to sleep
Ill go to sleep tomorrow
Ill go to sleep tomorrow
Ill go to sleep tomorrow
Ill go to sleep 
When pillow talks turn to pillow fights
Remember before you say goodnight
To make up before you go to sleep
So pillow fights turn to pillow dreams
Ill go to sleep
Ill go to sleep tomorrow
Ill go to sleep
Ill go to sleep tomorrow
Ill go to sleep tomorrow 
Ill go to sleep tomorrow
Ill go to sleep
