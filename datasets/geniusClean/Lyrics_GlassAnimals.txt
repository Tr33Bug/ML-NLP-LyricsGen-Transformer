TranslationsItalianoDeutschFranaisHeat Waves Lyrics
 Last night all I think about is you 
 Dont stop baby you can walk through 
 Dont want baby think about you 
 You know that Im never gonna lose 
Road shimmer wigglin the vision
Heat heat waves Im swimmin in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin the vision
Heat heat waves Im swimmin in a


Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Cant make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Cant make you happier now

Usually I put somethin on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin I can never give
Fake water all across the road
Its gone now the night has come but


Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Cant make you happier now


You cant fight it you cant breathe
You say somethin so lovin but
Now I gotta let you go
Youll be better off in someone new
I dont wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye


Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Cant make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Cant make you happier now


I just wonder what youre dreamin of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look thats perfectly unsad
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Heat waves been fakin me out


Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Cant make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin me out
Cant make you happier now

Road shimmer wigglin the vision
Heat heat waves Im swimmin in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin the vision
Heat heat waves Im swimmin in a mirrorAlright come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky smooth perfume


Right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
Wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
Ill say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

My my simple sir this aint gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I cant take this place no I cant take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space


Truth be told
Ive been there Ive done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes


Right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
Wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
Ill say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes


My my simple sir this aint gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I cant take this place no I cant take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you how can I be nice
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile


Right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
Wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
Ill say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes


My my simple sir this aint gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I cant take this place no I cant take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

When I was young and stupid my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me Please dont worry
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a oneway ticket
Out west thats where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
Hes gonna be Hakeem Olajuwon
Hes got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion


Byebye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush its killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost


Where I was from in NOLA no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
Hed stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him dont you blame me
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust hes
Chasing that pappy pipe dream


I know you dont but I
I know you dont but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I
That girl is gone but I still try
I think its over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My bodys looking wrong
My bodys looking wrong
My bodys looking wrong


Byebye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush its killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
Boy when I left you you were young
I was gone but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war


I want you to be happy
Free to run get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe youre just a little bit dappy

Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Dont you know you got my eyes
Ill make you fly
Youll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right


Boy now your life is backtofront
But youll see thats not for long
Cause I know youll feel the ghost
Of some memories so warm


Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe youre just a little bit dappy


Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Dont you know you got my eyes
Ill make you fly
Youll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right


Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe youre just a little bit dappy


Fly
Feel your mother right at your side
Dont you know you got my eyes
Ill make you fly
Youll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
Ill make you


Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe youre just a little bit


Oh oh ohDaddy was dumb said that Id be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar


I cant get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

Cut  back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now lean back and breathe


Im waking up lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine CocaCola
Thought that I was northern Camdens own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun gonna be a superstar


I cant get a job so I live with my mum
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmamas basement
Said I look mad she said I look wasted


Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now lean back and breathe




Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now lean back and breathePineapples are in my head
Got nobody cause Im braindead
Pineapples are in my head
Got nobody cause Im braindead


Somewhere in Southend when you were fun
You took my hand and you made me run
Up past the prison to the seafront
You climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

Why cant we laugh now like we did then
How come I see you and ache instead
How come you only look pleased in bed
Lets climb the cliff edge and jump again  Whoo 


Pineapples are in my head
 Pineapples are in my head 
Got nobody cause Im braindead
 Got nobody cause Im braindead 

Somebody said Im a fuckin slum
Dont know where I belong
Maybe youre fucking dumb
Maybe Im just a bum
Maybe youre fucking scum
Dont you go psycho chum
I want you for the world
I want you all the time  stop 


Pineapples are in my head
 When you were fun 
Got nobody cause Im braindead
 You made me run 
Pineapples are in my head
 To the seafront 
Got nobody cause Im braindead
 She took the plunge 


Five thousand footsteps in your wet dress
Back to the house with your arms round my neck
We drank pork soda with tangled legs
I wont forget how you looked at me then
I know Im no sweet prince of love
Those times that we got drunk
Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub
Maybe you still think of us
Phone buzz and still I jump
Why dont I say it then
I want you all the time


Why cant we laugh now like we did then
How come I see you and ache instead
How come you only look pleased in bed
Lets climb the cliff edge and jump again


Pineapples are in my head
 Pineapples are in my head 
Got nobody cause Im braindead
 Got nobody cause Im braindead 
Pineapples are in my head
 Pineapples are in my head 
Got nobody cause Im braindead
 Got nobody cause Im braindead 

Pineapples are in my head
 Pineapples are in my head 
Got nobody cause Im braindead
 Got nobody cause Im braindead 
Pineapples are in my head
 Pineapples are in my head 
Got nobody cause Im braindead
 Got nobody cause Im braindead Agnes just stop and think a minute
Why dont you light that cigarette and
Calm down now stop and breathe a second
Go back to the very beginning
Cant you see what was different then
You were just popping Percocet
Maybe just four a week at best
Maybe a smoke to clear the head


Your head is so numb that nervous breath you try to hide
Between the motions that trembling tender little sigh
And so it goes a choking rose back
To be reborn I want to hold you like youre mine

You see the sad in everything
A genius of love and loneliness and
This time you overdid the liquor
This time you pulled the fucking trigger
These days youre rolling all the time
So low so you keep getting high
Where went that cheeky friend of mine
Where went that billiondollar smile


Guess life is long when soaked in sadness
On borrowed time from Mister Madness
And so it goes a choking rose back
To be reborn I want to hold you like youre mine


Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Youre gone but youre on my mind
Im lost but I dont know why
Dont you need me
Oh baby boy
Cause Im so happy
Without your noise


Baby now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
Were moving forwards faster
And lately I cant take it
Baby now my bodys intact and
In an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us
And lately I cant take it

Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
Shes broken but shes fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while shes getting blazed


Dont you need me
Oh baby boy
Cause Im so happy
Without your noise


Lazy and lying on your belly
With a Super Porp cola
Looking at your phone in clothes
Youve worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster
Maybe I wish I could remould you
To vertical and golden
But you turned to Styrofoam
And so it hurts to say its hopeless
And we aint gonna make it


Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
Shes broken but shes fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar while shes getting blazed


Shes drunk on old cartoons
Liquid TV afternoons
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Sometimes it makes me sad


Dont you need me
Oh baby boy
Cause Im so happy
Without your noise
Dont you need me
You baby boy
Cause Im so happy
Without your noise


Oh baby now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby now my head is on backwards
Oh baby now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby now my head is on backwards
Dont you need me
You baby boy
Cause Im so happy
Without your noiseSmells good up here Yeah its the candle yo its uh yo its uh Sausage  Laughter  Sausage candle Most people dont do it the way I do it very personal So like even the money twenties twenties twenties Yknow like whatever I just like sausage


I dont ever wanna pick a slice
One is pretty but the other lies
Chewing on a fat smoke
No filter but youre puffing
Sucking on a slim Vogue
Dark fingernail polish

Im the treasure baby Im the prize
Cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie
Shitty old pistola
Shot a bullet through my wallet
Gonna go to Pensacola
Gonna fuck my way through college


Youve gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
Im gonna sleep cause you live in my daydreams
Youve gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
Im gonna sleep cause you live in my daydreams


Sitting pretty in the prime of life
Im so tasty and the price is right
Stewing in the black dope
Im filthy and I love it
Studebaker all gold
Got a shotgun in my pocket


Youve gone with the thick rims
Big look with the lip ring and things
Wake me when the bell rings
Im gonna sleep cause you live in my daydreamsWhen I was a boy I lived on Poplar Street
Just a little child with plasters on my knees
Watching all the world from high up in the trees
I saw Mrs Moore sleep round with Mr Keats


I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict yeah

Mama always called that woman prostitits
For wearing lower cuts than most and red lipstick
One night Mrs Moore she made her eyes at me
Pulled me through her door and stuck her teeth in deep


I feel like a new man
Red flowers in my bed
Breathe straight through the crisp air
Dead flowers in the sand
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict yeah


And all your days are gone sitting on the floor
In your underwear begging me for more
And all my days are gone sitting on the floor
In my underwear begging you for more
Cause


I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict and
I am a true romantic
Free falling love addict yeah


Just another boy who lived on Poplar Street
Tangled up in lust and her exotic needs
One night Mrs Moore she called collect to me
I dont love you anymore she said and ceased to be
Just another boy
Just another boy
Just another boyI said to you Why did you do it
Touch the glass Ill feel ya through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot


You think that youre Space Ghost
Youre wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go

Gotta be all that coco ayy
Playin too much of that GTA

You think that youre Space Ghost
Youre wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go
My way and you go yours


Were you bored of gender norms
Of being alone no mama home
A bad divorce or sad we cant
Afford the clothes our heroes own
Remember when you stole
Moms old Geo Metro
You wore her old bathrobe
Too small to see the road


We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokmon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and Real Monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom


You think that youre Space Ghost
Youre wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go
My way and you go yours


Heard you were lookin up the cookbook names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Supervillain with a manifesto dang
Gotta say Im pretty glad they caught you man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007 Nintendo games
Burned Hot Pockets in the microwave


You think that youre Space Ghost
Youre wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go
My way and you go yours

 Living in the valley cuttin porno Pullin down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist


That first friend you had that worst thing you said
That perfect moment that last tear you shed
All youve done in bed all on Memorex
All roundround your head all roundround your head

Pullin down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist


Youve had too much of the digital love
You want everything live you want things you can touch
Make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth
Make it feel like that song that just unopened you
You were ten years old holdin hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag you want boys with guitars


Pullin down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist


You see Kodachrome you see pink and gold
You see Mulholland glow you see in airplane mode
All roundround your head all roundround your head
All roundround your head all roundround your head


You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
You go ask your questions like What makes a man
Oh its 2020 so its time to change that
So you go make an album and call it DreamlandDrip drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So so so unusual
You taste like surfing videos


Im going to read your mind
Big dicks and big ol titties on the sly
Say I got Aries eyes
Fuck no Im a bonafide Aquemini
Ooh who are you hiding
White Russians and dirty diamonds
You fake your shyness
I just wish that I could see through you

Cheap booze Pepsi blue
You got bottles in from 2002
Hot glue vape juice
Hit undo how the hell are you so cool


Drip drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So so so unusual
You taste like surfing videos


Its chemical warfare
Red lips and television eyewear
Raspberry soda hair
In the pool in a blowup gummy bear


Fake youth ScoobyDoo
Push Pops on the corner of the roof
Froot Loops superfood
Chat shit but wheres the real you
Never seen The Price Is Right
Im a liar Ive been on that shit since 99
You make me like a clown
Clap clap youre a cleverclever cookie now


Waterfalls coming out your mouth
What the hell are we doing now
Waterfalls tearing you apart
What the hell are we doing nowPut your hand down boy welcome to my zoo
Put your head inside my big black wild while
I can still help you
See the snake baboon funky chic and smooth
Honey can you spy the divine apeswine
Cause he can see you


Im a man Im a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
Im a man dont spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
Im crooked but upright

And all I ever want is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart
I said to the thing that I once was


Im a man Im a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
Im a man dont spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
Im crooked but upright


To the left now boy underneath the moon
By the thick tan sand and the tall thin grass
One more thing for you
See the distant flume in the sleepy dunes
Makes my nerves clench close and my bones go cold
When I see that room


And all I ever want is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart


Im a man Im a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
Im a man dont spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
Im crooked but uprightWhatll it be now Mr Mole
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones


Slow down its a science
Hes been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo


Slow down its a science
Hes been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child


Wanna play cheat now says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold


Slow down its a science
Hes been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child


We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We float before the sea at dusk
In heavy mist in glitter dust
I smile before I want to
I smile because you want to
We sip the wind through lips of lust
And out it comes warm wisps of love
I smile because I want to
I smile because you want to
Put the flowers in your hair
Wrap your tendrils round my chest
I smile because I want to
I am your boy


Shake my little soul for you now toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
Im a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise


Down by the shore a funny foal
Who bit my wings and ate em whole
You left before I come to
You left before I come to
We took to hills into the trees
I hit my head and bit the leaves
You left before I come to
You left before I


Shake my little soul for you now toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
Im a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise


Shanks of slate fall to the beach
Wrapped in life in ultra greens
Pools teem with tiny feet
And whorls of tired anemones
You left before I got to
You left before I got to
You left before I
You left before I

Shook the flowers from your hair
Run to me and kiss my hands
Im dead before I
Im dead before I


Shake my little soul for you now toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
Im a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise
Shake my little soul for you now toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
Im a man of many tricks and tools and toys
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want toMmm I shut my eyes
You call but I just cut the line
I know your style
I know that you want one more night
And Im backsliding
Into this just one more time


Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh so much dj vu
And now

I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
Its a hit and run
You go back there when youre done
Dont you want some more
Cause I can feel your love


Mmm that purple touch
Everyone who sees you falls in love
You eat us up
You live like youre on camera
You slide on top
A moon to all the juice in us


Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh so much dj vu
And now


I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
Its a hit and run
You go back there when youre done
Dont you want some more
Cause I can feel your love
 Woo 


Maybe in time
When were both better at life
Daylight can open my eyes
And youll still be by my side
But meanwhile
Ive got my contact high
Youve got your powdered lies
Weve got these summertime nights
Night by night I let you eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
 Woo 
 Ayy ayy ayy ayy 


I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
Its a hit and run
You go back there when youre done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
Its a hit and run
You go back there when youre done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
Its a hit and run
You go back there when youre done
Dont you want some more
Cause I can feel your love

I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love909
You gonna call it or am I
One more time
This puppy love is out of line
One more slide
And then were back to real life


Ooh and Im falling now but its so wrong
You talk like a man and taste like the sun
Ooh and you lift your eyes up from the dust
I knew just then I knew it was done

I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of yous at home with him
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of yous not part of this


Soft blue skies
Helium balloons float up away
Broad daylight
But were sunflowers in the rain


My mama said they used to be white pyramids
They float above the sand theyre slowly sinking in
Are our foundations destined to keep crumbling
Just cause we started this with zero innocence
I just cant build on something that begins like this
Its a blood diamond flawless but for that one thing

You just want backstreets you dont want me
You just gonna hate it all the way
You just want backstreets you dont want me
You just gonna hate it all the way


Hello who is this Hello
Are you watching TV
Say Byebye
ByebyeIn the summer took my gun
And made him go to Neverland
He was something my old husband
He had all youd ever want
Did you say something Whatd you say
Was that your voice or was that me
Little voices buzzing poison
Backward noise from everything
Dr Swango says Im psycho
Says they all from Neverland
Theyll never ever let me be
Was that your voice or was that me



Dirty Dustin said he saw him
Playing ball with Dizzy Jim
Dizzy Jim had never spoken
Whispered back You murdered him
My heart strings broke and it was me
I pull they stretch infinitely


In the summer silence I was getting violent
In the summer silence I was doing nothing
In the summer silence I was getting violent
In the summer silence I was doing nothing


Play with me my love in the summer sun
Ill be waiting in your favourite Cheshire grin
Lay with me my dear in the evening clear
Ill be dreaming in my paperpale skin


In the summer silence I was getting violent
In the summer silence I was doing nothing
In the summer silence I was getting violent
In the summer silence I was doing nothing
In the summer silence I was getting violent
In the summer silence I was doing nothing
In the summer silence I was getting violent
In the summer silence I was doing nothing


In the summer silence in the summer silence
In the summer silence I was doing nothingBaby dont go
Ill stop breathing coke
No more bloody nose
No more John Does
