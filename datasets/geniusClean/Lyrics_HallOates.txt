You Make My Dreams Lyrics
What I want youve got and it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle the candle feeds the flame
Yeah what Ive got full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together and how I cant explain


Well well well you
You make my dreams come true
You  You you ooh ooh ooh you 
Well well well you
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true
 You you you ooh ooh ooh you 

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When theyre messing with the dreamer I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
Cause I aint the way you found me and Ill never be the same


Well well well you
You make my dreams come true
You  You you ooh ooh ooh you 
Well well well you
You make my dreams come true
 You you you ooh ooh ooh you

Using the bodies up as we go
Im waking up to fantasy
The shades all around arent the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
Were soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Ohohoh ohohoh


Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didnt
Use them so much yeah
Were soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much


Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ooh
Oh ohohoh ohohoh

 Out of touch 


Ow youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around


Youre out of touch  Were soul alone girl 
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
 Out of touch out of time out of touch out of time girl 
But Im out of my head
When youre not around


Youre out of touch  Reach out for something to hold 
Time

When youre not around
 Youre too cold girl too cold girl too cold girl yeah 
Youre out of touch

Theyre about to let you go
And the locker slam on the plan
You had tonight
Youve been messin around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
Theres a wise guy that you know could
Put you right
In the lot the boy thats idling by
Doesnt rev your heart
Cause its only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart

What they need is adult education
Back to school its a bad situation
 Oh yeah oh yeah

Hot and cool  huh huh

 Oh yeah oh yeah

You go back to school its a bad situation

Theyre calling it preparation  huh huh 
Youre waiting for a separation
Youre nothing but another odd number  huh huh 
Memories that you wont remember
So you got a little education  huh huh 
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school  huh huh 
Maybe some of itll rub off on ya
The boys are busy in the mirrors  huh huh 
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender  huh huh 
More memories you wont remember

I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult  huh huh

But he said Leave me alone Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said Leave me alone Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might

She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her makeup to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night


But he said Leave me alone Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said Leave me alone Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might


She gave him her look
It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldnt decide if he should hold his ground


But he said Leave me alone Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said Leave me alone Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might
Yeah


She turned tossed her head
Unlike her opening move her final exit line
He waited much too long
But by the time he got his courage up she was gone


And he screamed  Leave me alone  Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said  Leave me alone  Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might


He said  Leave me alone  Im a  Family man 
And I dont think I want it tonight
And he said  Leave me alone  Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might

Say it

Say it isnt so painful
To tell me that youre dissatisfied
The last time I asked you I really got a lame excuse

Now wicked things can happen
You see em goin down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more


 Say it 
Tell me what you want
Yeah Ill do it Baby I promise right now
 Say it 
Who propped you up when you were stopped
Low motivation had you on the ground


I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide Away goodbye

A thousand reasons why you have to say it isnt so


 It Isnt So 
Now Say It isnt So
 It isnt so 
Now Say It isnt so
 It isnt so 
Oh Say it isnt so

 Say it 
We like to be the strangers at the party
Two rebels in a shell
 Say it 
You like to move with the best of them
You know we move so well


Dont need someone to lean on
I know why theres an open door
But if Im faced with being replaced
I want you even more
So baby say it isnt so


 It Isnt So

 It isnt so 
Now Say It isnt so

Oh Say it isnt so

 Come on Philly dont forget me now Babe if we cant solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears
Whoa so you go again
When the leading man appears


Always the same thing
But cant you see weve got everything
Going on and on and on

And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you you


Go on and go free
Maybe youre too close to see
I can feel your body move
But doesnt mean that much to me


I cant go on singing the same theme
Cause you cant see weve got everything
Baby even though you know


That everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
You just dont care everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you you


Cause you cant see weve got everything
Baby even though you know
That everytime you go away
 Everytime you go away 
 Everytime you go away 
Why you have to go away right now
 Everytime you go away 
 Everytime you go away 
Go on and go away girl
 Everytime you go away 
I dont understand why you gotta go girl
 Everytime you go away 
Go on and go free
Even though you mean so much to me
 Everytime you go away 
I dont understand baby
 Everytime you go away 
Oh baby baby everytime you go
 Everytime you go away 
You dont know you dont know
Because you never understand girl
 Everytime you go away 
Why you have to go away right now
 Everytime you go away 
Everytime you go girl
 Everytime you go away 
Go on go on and go free
 Everytime you go away 
Baby you mean so much to me

 Everytime you go away 
Go girl go girl gotta go girl
You won babe
 Everytime you go away 
Baby baby baby
 Everytime you go away 
In the pouring rain
Just to see your face
Id bare my soul to a total stranger
Just to say your name
And Im not ashamed

Just to love you into every morning
I would change my name
And run away
I wont do it for money
I wont do it for pride
I wont do it to please somebody else
If it dont feel right

But Ill do it for you
And at least Ill try
I dont need any other reason
Than I feel it deep inside

Ill Do It For Love

I would write your name across the sky
So the world could see
What you mean to me
Id sing songs at the top of my voice
In an empty room
Just to dance with you

And to love you into every morning
Ill leave the world behind
And Ill slow down time

I wont do it for money
I wont do it for pride
I wont do it to please somebody else
If it dont feel right
But Ill do it for you
And at least Ill try
I dont need any other reason
Than I feel it deep inside

Ill Do It For Love

What I do for love can take us anywhere at allHe fell like a rock she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder as they moved cross the floor
When the music was over she slipped out of his arms and out the door

Yeah a man loves a woman but he cant understand
Why shes sad when she stares at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club where the long shadows fall
Drops a coin in the jukebox not the phone on the wall

So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow maybe more than today
Were so close so close yet so far away
Some people think if you really believe
Thats what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yea I know someone who just heads for the sun
She says I dont wanna be wise I just wanna stay young

So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow though were stuck in today
Baby were so close so close yet so far away

Theres a restless look in your eye tonight
Theres a secret hurt in my heart
And the dream that pulls us together girl
Is a dream thats gonna tear us tear us apart

Theres a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh are you lookin for some way out of here
We gotta fight to keep it together girl
For the dream that keeps us

So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
Who would of thought girl that wed end up this way
Getting so close so close
So far away

Were living in a dream world
Yet were livin today girl
Just you and me baby
Gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try
