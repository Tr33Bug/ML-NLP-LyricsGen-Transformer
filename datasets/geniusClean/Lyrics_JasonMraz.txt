TranslationsPortugusIm Yours Lyrics
Well you done done me in you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but youre so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now Im trying to get back

Before the cool done run out
Ill be giving it my bestest
Nothings going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some

But I wont hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait Im yours


Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn youre free
Look into your heart and youll find
Love love love love

Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
Were just one big family
And its our Godforsaken right to be
Loved love love love loved


So I wont hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait Im sure
Theres no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate Im yours


Do you want to come on scootch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear


Ive been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I be saying is there aint no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
Its what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue


But I wont hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait  Im yours


Well open up your mind and see like me  I wont hesitate 
Open up your plans and damn youre free  No more no more 
Look into your heart and youll find  It cannot wait 
The sky is yours  Im sure 
So please dont please dont please dont  No need to complicate 
Theres no need to complicate  Our time is short 
Cause our time is short  This is 
This oh this oh this is our fate  our fate 
Im yoursWhen I look into your eyes
Its like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well theres so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that youve come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul


Well I wont give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
Im giving you all my love
Im still looking up

And when youre needing your space
To do some navigating
Ill be here patiently waiting
To see what you find


Cause even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
Weve got a lot to learn
God knows were worth it
No I wont give up


I dont wanna be someone who walks away so easily
Im here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end youre still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didnt break we didnt burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got and what Im not
And who I am


I wont give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
Im giving you all my love
Im still looking up
Im still looking up
Well I wont give up on us
God knows Im tough enough
We got a lot to learn
God knows were worth it  And were worth it 


I wont give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
Im giving you all my love
Im still looking upMay you have auspiciousness and causes of success
May you have the confidence to always do your best
May you take no effort in your being generous
Sharing what you can nothing more nothing less
May you know the meaning of the word happiness
May you always lead from the beating in your chest
May you be treated like an esteemed guest
May you get to rest may you catch your breath


And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow

Well heres to the hearts that youre gonna break
Heres to the lives that youre gonna change
Heres to the infinite possible ways to love you

Heres to the good times were gonna have
You dont need money you got a free pass
Heres to the fact that Ill be sad without you
I want you to have it all


Oh I want you to have it all
I want you to have it
I want you to have it all


May you be as fascinating as a slap bracelet
May you keep the chaos and the clutter off your desk
May you have unquestionable health and less stress
Having no possessions though immeasurable wealth
May you get a gold star on your next test
May your educated guesses always be correct
And may you win prizes shining like diamonds
May you really own it each moment to the next

And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow


Well heres to the hearts that youre gonna break

Cause here it comes its a light a beautiful light over the horizon into our eyes
Oh my my how beautiful oh my beautiful mother
She told me Son in life youre gonna go far if you do it right youll love where you are
Just know wherever you go you can always come home


Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh

240 thousand miles from the Moon weve come a long way to belong here
To share this view of the night a glorious night over the horizon is another bright sky
Oh my my how beautiful oh my irrefutable father
He told me Son sometimes it may seem dark but the absence of the light is a necessary part
Just know youre never alone you can always come back home


Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
You can always come back back


Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand that you can hold on to
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your homes inside of you


Just know that wherever you go no youre never alone you will always get back home
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh


93 million miles from the Sun people get ready get ready
Cause here it comes its a light a beautiful light over the horizon into our eyes
It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

Ive been chasing summer around
Searching for the sunshine
Looking for a good time
Following the good vibes
Listening to intuition as its happening
Diggin into life cuz at times it can be saddening
Yea it can be a grey day if youre lonely
A little rain suddenly turns heavy
But a whole lotta love can make the clouds go away
Maybe the time for us is now


When the tables set for two
And theres nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else


It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely


Love lalala love
Love lala love
One and only I could make you Unlonely


I give you my word although Im making words up
Unlonely aint a word but I dont give a FRUCK
Cause Im fresh from the farm where critics cant bother me
Living is tricky as it is so that aint stopping me
You and me we both agree that no one needs the scrutiny
All we want is peace and love and honestly you ruined me
With your beautiful smile and your style continuity
Id be a fool not to take the opportunity to say
Hey we should be homies
I think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni
We could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie
Or maybe just be ourselves Never Phony
Never second guessing the freindship connection
Parallel living never in possession
Of your individual personal expression
Together were just a much better reflection of Love


And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely

Love lalala love
Love lala love
One and only I could make you Unlonely
Love lalala love
Love lala love
One and only I could make you Unlonely


When the tables set for two
And theres nobody with you
Seeing movies by yourself
Let me be your someone else
If youre spending time alone
If its just you and your phone
Taking pictures of yourself
Baby maybe I can help


It could be love
And we could be homies
Once you get to know me
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely
Or we could take it slowly
And we could keep it low key
I could be your one and only
I could make you Unlonely


Love lalala love
Love lala love
One and only I could make you unlonely

It could be love
And we could be homies  Love lalala love 
And once you get to know me  Love lala love 
I could be your one and only
I could make you UnlonelyIt feels like weve been friends forever yeah
And we always see eye to eye
The more time we spend together
The more I wanna say whats on my mind


Take it easy
Cause it aint easy to say


I wanna be more than friends
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna tell everyone youre taken
And take your hand until the end

At the risk of sounding foolish
I dont wanna fool around no more
If were gonna do this then lets do this
You can fix my broken heart if its all yours


So take it easy
Cause it aint easy to say


I wanna be more than friends
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna tell everyone youre taken
And take your hand until the end
I wanna be more than friends

Either way I know well make it  I know I know I know well make it Was it you who spoke the words that
Things would happen but not to me
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
Oh taking your advice and Im looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
Oh but often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright lights turn to night
Oh until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love the love that I love yeah
 Da da da da 


See Im all about them words
Over numbers unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages pages pages for words
More words than I had ever heard and I feel so alive


Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh love love
You and I you and I
Not so little you and I anymore mmm


And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy


Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well Im almost finally out of
Im finally out of
Finally de de de de de
Well Im almost finally finally
Well Im free oh Im free


And its okay if you have to go away
Oh just remember the telephone works both ways
But if I never ever hear them ring
If nothing else Ill think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and thats okay
Cause Ill remember everything you sang


Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well then Im almost finally out of
Im finally out of finally de de de de de de
Well Im almost finally finally out of wordsIm taking a moment just imaginin that Im dancin with you
Im your pole and all youre wearing is your shoes
You got soul you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you
And you have your own engaging style
And youve got the knack to vivify
And you make my slacks a little tight
You may unfasten them if you like
Thats if you crash and spend the night


But you dont fold you dont fade
Youve got everything you need especially me
Sister youve got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk sister youve got it all

Curl your upper lip up and let me look around
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch
Cause theyre the perfect jumping off point of getting closer to your butterfly
Well you float on by
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine
And lets mood the lights and finally make it right


But you dont fold you dont fade
Youve got everything you need especially me
Sister youve got it all
You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk sister youve got it all
Youve got it all youve got it all youve got it all
Youve got it all youve got it all youve got it all
Youve got it all youve got it all


Doll I need to see you pull your knee socks up
Let me feel you up side down slide in slide out slide over here
Climb into my mouth now child


Butterfly well you landed on my mind
Damn right you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside
Now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes
I wanna fly with you and I dont wanna lie to you
Cause I cause I cant recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
Youre an openminded lady
Youve got it all
And I never forget a face
If Im making my own
I have my days
Lets face the fact here its you whos got it all
You know that fortune favors the brave
Well let me get paid while I make you breakfast
The rest is up to you you make the call


You make the call to make my day
In your message say my name
Your talk is all the talk sister youve got it all


I cant recall a better day
Sun coming to shine on the occasion
You sophisticated lady oh youve got it all

Youve got it all youve got it all youve got it all
Youve got it all youve got it all youve got it all
Youve got it all youve got it all youve got it all
Youve got it all youve got it all


Butterfly baby well youve got it allYouve got the best of both worlds
Youre the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but youre needy
Humble but youre greedy
And based on your body language
And shoddy cursive Ive been reading
Your style is quite selective
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

Hey what a beautiful mess this is
Its like picking up trash in dresses


Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And dont mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions dear
Cause here we are here we are


Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks  theyre quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
Theres no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words im paraphrasing this relationship were staging


Hey what a beautiful mess this is
Its like picking up trash in dresses


Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And kind and courteous is a life Ive heard
But its nice to say that we played in the dirt
Cause here here we are here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are

Were still here
What a beautiful mess this is
Its like taking a guess when the only answer is Yes


Through timeless words and priceless pictures
Well fly like birds not of this earth

And tides  they turn  and hearts disfigure
But thats no concern when were wounded together


And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
But its nice today Oh the wait was so worth itWell I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away
Cause you were born on the fourth of July freedom ring
Well something on the surface it stings
I said something on the surface well it kinda makes me nervous
Who says that you deserve this
And what kind of god would serve this
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well if youve gots the poison Ive gots the remedy

The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that its serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end


I I wont worry my life away
Hey oh oh
I I wont worry my life away
Hey oh oh


Well I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me cause if youve gots the poison Ive gots the remedy


The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that its serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end


I I wont worry my life away
Hey oh oh
I  I wont I wont I wont 
I wont worry my life away
Hey oh oh


When I fall in love  I fall in love  I take my time
Theres no need to hurry when Im making up my mind
You can turn off the sun  Turn off the sun  but Im still gonna shine And Ill tell you why


Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that its serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how youre gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end


I  Cause I wont 
I wont worry my life away
Hey oh oh
I  I wont I wont I wont 
I wont worry my life away
 I wont worry my life 
I  I wont

Worry my life away

Hey whats upUh I just lost it at the end of the day I fucking lost it I just blew up My whole entire fucking apartment building I told everyone to go fuck themselves I just had a hard time today and uh I dont know


Calm down
Deep breaths
And get yourself dressed instead
Of running around
And pulling on your threads
And breaking yourself up
If its a broken part replace it
If its a broken arm then brace it
If its a broken heart then face it

And hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything will be fine


Hang on
Help is on the way
And stay strong
Im doing everything


Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
Hold your own
Know your name
And go your own way
And everything everything will be fine
Everything


Are the details in the fabric
Are the things that make you panic
Are your thoughts results of static cling
Are the things that make you blow
Hell no reason go on and scream
If youre shocked its just the fault
Of faulty manufacturing


Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Everything
Hold your own
Know your name
Go your own way
Hold your own  Are the details in the fabric 
Know your name  Are the things that make you panic 
Go your own way  Are your thoughts results of static cling 
Hold your own  Are the details in the fabric 
Know your name  Are the things that make you panic 
Go your own way  Is it Mother Natures sewing machine 
Hold your own  Are the things that make you blow 
Know your name  Hell no reason go on and scream 
Go your own way  If youre shocked its just the fault 
 Of faulty manufacturing 


Everything will be fine
Everything in no time at all
Hearts will hold


New message
Yo whats up man I uh I dont know I just wanted to say that uh everythings cool with me now I mean I just think I think Ill always be funky cant stop being funky but I guess we just deal with it how it comes deal with the humps take the jumps I feel like youre an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea And I love you buddy Ok ByeYou fucking did it
You really did it yeah
You really did it
You really did it


All those who are hanging round the water cooler
Will never believe how you tackled the thousand puzzle pieces
And you could see it before we completed it
Before we made it whole
How you put it all together with a blindfold
Youre like a long game token that keeps the game going
But your claim to fame is how you like to lay low
Out of the lime light
Which can hurt your eyes
If youre not careful youll become another devil in disguise
But you watch your back
You watch your back
Youre growing eyes in the back of your head
To prevent another sneak attack
Sneak attack
You must be keeping secret weapons in your fanny pack
Youre like my laughing gas you got the cat to dance
Youre like Lance on a mountain in the Tour de France
You got a wing span spanning the globe
You got gold
And youre teaching us to let go
Youre a wise old owl when youre the cats meow
If this were twelfth grade you would be my cap and gown
If this were India then you would be a sacred cow
And Id bow down to you
So grateful to the Gods for making you



Youll be standing up for equal rights of the American people
And youll be meeting all the influential seekers with a similar dream
Youve got a front seat saved thats emblazoned with your name
And a super hero cape on
You see the future as a sky full of possibility
With a spryness of mind and a psychic ability
You probably wont die at the hands of an enemy
And not in a den of inequity
Youre not the average Joe youre not the average Jane
Youre not above or below but youre never just plain
You never take no personally
And any time you get stopped you try another way
Could we settle for a kiss without a cease and desist
If they ask we wont tell because were activists
I am that I am and you are that you are
And were all that is
How perfect your attitude be




When you circumnavigating the turntable call and attracts
Like you be jumping in the water you be making a splash
You be keeping your heart beat going
And you be keeping the harmony going
Well theres an awful lot of musical styles you could play
Well theres an awful lot of tastes
An awful lot of dates you could be on
You be keeping your back bone strong
And you be keeping the trombone blowing
Well every friend of mine will give each other highfives
When your beautiful mind is to your own devices
You do what you like and you always like what you try
You touch me like an iPhone application
Move me like a smooth jazz music station
Do what you do in the way that you choose to do them
Oh my God
Youre quick to be so quotable damn you got a way with words
You got a magical handshake for saving the earth
You are a generous man
You are so awesome it hurts

You are awesome




You are awesome
You are awesome
You are awesome
You are awesome
You are aweso
MeYo brother A to Z
Yo whassup B
Yo what time is it

I may be skinny at times but Im fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and Ima grab at it

Cause baby listen to this dont wanna miss it while its hittin
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But dont ever quit cause soon Im gonna let you in but see

I dont care what you might think about me
Youll get by without me if you want
Well I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it wouldnt be a let down
But sugar dont forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Dont judge it by the color confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Like the geek in the pink
Like the geek in the pink yeah
The geek in the pink


Well this relationship fodder dont mean to bother nobody
But Cupids automatic musta fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often thats whats the matter
At least Im talking about it keep my pattern of flattery
And she was starin through the doorframe and
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then
Cause I aint comin home I dont need that attention see


I dont care what she might think about me
Shell get by without me if she wants
But I could be the one to take her home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it wouldnt be a let down
But sugar dont forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Dont judge it by the color confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away


Hey baby look at me go

You better take it from a geek like me
Well I can save you from unoriginal dumdums
Who wouldnt care if you complete them or not


So what Ive got a short attention span
A coke in my hand
Because Id rather have the afternoon relax and understand
My hip hop and flipflops  well it dont stop with the light rock
My shot to mock you kinda puts me in a tight spot
The hype is nothing more than hooha
So Im developing a language and Im callin it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and youll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener


I dont care what you might think about me
Youll get by without me if you want
I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it wouldnt be a let down
But sugar dont forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Dont judge it by the color confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away

HEY PRINCESS

Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid Knew I looked like a big fool
I must of had the flu I thought the shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me what did I do
Knew you was right for me knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell knew I would write for you

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but youre so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now Im trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
Ill be giving it my bestest
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some


I wont hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait Im yours


I dont need no time and I dont need no reason
Im yours whenever whenever whenever ill be there
Til every season
Without you in my life
There would be no meaning
Baby im yours forever
Seasons come seasons go
Love you so much baby I dont know
I love you I love you I love you
Yeahhhhhhh


So I wont hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait Im sure
Theres no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate Im yours


Knew I would keep you well knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull out my heart and bring it right to you
You knew all about me baby but you wasnt about me baby
Young Wayne prepare for change
Because it seem like girly dont care the same
You had my chain you buried my name then we had champagne


Ive been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a face and laughed
I guess what Im be saying is there aint no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
Its what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue


I wont hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait Im sureLets drive out to the desert at midnight
To dance in the dust of our headlights
And score some good seats for the sunrise
And dress up in clothes we dont mind getting messed up
Where no one will know how to get us
We dont need a map well just drive drive drive


I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what its like
To spend the whole night with you just you
You just you

We can head north over the oceans of turquoise
Where after awhile therell be no noise
Except for the sound of our heartbeats beating on
And well stand in a canyon alone
Singing our favorite songs
And wait for the words to return
In the echo echo echo echo echo echo


I wanna get lost with you
And hide out out under the light of the moon
I wanna get lost with you
And see what its like to spend the whole night with you just you
With you just you
With you just you
With you just you

And I wanna get lost


Lets see what the night can do
Lets see what the night can do
Lets see what the night can do
I wanna get lost

Lets see what the night can do
Lets see what the night can do
Lets see what the night can do
I wanna get lost

Lets see what the night can do
Lets see what the night can do
Lets see what the night can do
I wanna get lost with you

I wanna get lost with you
Lets see what the night can do
I wanna get lost with you
Lets see what our hearts wanna do

I wanna know what its like
To spend the whole night with you just you
With you just you
With you just youWake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap and the net will appear


I dont wanna wake before
The dream is over
Im gonna make it mine
Yes I Ill know it
Im gonna make it mine
Yes Ill make it all mine

I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Requesting that its lifting you up
Up up and away
And over to a table at the Gratitude Caf


And I am finally there
And all the angels theyll be singing
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love this


Well I dont wanna break before
The tour is over
Im gonna make it mine
Yes I I will own it
Im gonna make it mine
Yes Ill make it all mine


Timings everything
And this time theres plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyones emitting


Well I dont wanna wait no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
Im gonna make it mine
Oh yes Im following your joy
Im gonna make it mine
Because I I am open
Im gonna make it mine
Thats why I will show it
Im gonna make it all mine
Gonna make gonna make gonna make gonna make make it make it make it make it mine
All mine yes Ill make it all mineI cant stop thinking about you
And dreaming of your smile
I cant stop reading into you
Love oh yeah youre the best book Ive read in awhile
I dont just read you for the articles
I read you til my heart is full
You keep my heart abeating
Youre keeping me from sleeping
The only one Im cheating is me if I dont take control

We got nothing to lose might as well hold hands
Were already fools so we might as well dance

Put your loving arms around me once more
And well go crashing into folks on the dance floor
You can walk all over my shoes if you want to

We got nothing to lose might as well take off our pants
Yeah were already fools so we might as well dance


Soon the song will be over
Well have to say goodnight
Dont you want some closure
Before you turn out the light
Honey think of your heart
Yeah the hearts too heavy to slow
Partly cause its running the show
Partly cause the beat is connected to the feet
And Ive got the sweetest crush on you
Baby lets go


Weve got nothing to lose might as well hold hands
Yeah were already fools so we might as well dance
Weve got nothing prove might as well take off our pants
Yeah were already fools so we might as well dance
Yeah were already fools so we might as well dance
Ok go go hang your heart on any tree
You can make yourself available to anybody
Cause every living person knows you are a prize
Whichever way you go Ill be easy to find
I dont ask for much just be honest with me
I dont ask for much


Think of this song as a promise you can do what you want
If you decide you wanna move into a new stage
Deleting me from pages in your mission statement
My love is unconditional make no mistake
I dont ask for much just be honest with me
I dont ask for much just be honest with me

Who we are when love is what it wants to be
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far
Being treated to the life like a superstar


I can hold space while you see what your heart has to say about me
Theres no dotted line to sign away your freedom
I acknowledge you for what you do to keep strong
Ill always stand beside you dont get me wrong
I dont ask for much just be honest with me


Who we are when love is what it wants to be
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far
Being treated to the life like a superstar


If I miscommunicated I apologies
If the picture that I painted wasnt very nice
My love is standing by you whatever you decide
I dont ask for much just be honest with me
I dont ask for much just be honest with me


Who we are when love is what it wants to be
We are free and we are having the best day ever by far
Yes we are
It takes a crane to build a crane
It takes two floors to make a story
It takes an egg to make a hen
It takes a hen to make an egg
There is no end to what Im saying
It takes a thought to make a word
And it takes some words to make an action
And t takes some work to make it work
It takes some good to make it hurt
It takes some bad for satisfaction

La la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la


It takes a night to make it dawn
And it takes a day to make you yawn brother
And it takes some old to make you young
It takes some cold to know the sun
It takes the one to have the other
And it takes no time to fall in love
But it takes you years to know what love is
And it takes some fears to make you trust
It takes those tears to make it rust
It takes the dust to have it polished yeah


Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la
Life is so  Life is so 


It takes some silence to make sound
It takes a loss before you found it
And it takes a road to go nowhere
It takes a toll to make you care
It takes a hole to make a mountain


Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful
Ah la la la la la la life goes full circle
Ha la la la la la life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la life is meaningful
Ha la la la la la life is wonderful
Ha la la la la la life it is so wonderful


It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful
It is wonderful
It is meaningful
It goes full circle
Wonderful
Meaningful
Full circle
WonderfulThe question is why why are we here
To say our hellos and goodbyes then disappear
This beautiful life what is it for
To learn how to master peace or master war


Theres only one answer that matters
Even if your heart has been shattered
Whatever you want whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer

Love love love love
Love love love love


We all make mistakes no were not perfect yet
Maybe God made us all from an accident
And the question that sits on everyones lips
Is why should we pick ourselves up and start over again


Theres only one answer that matters
Even if your heart has been shattered
Whatever you want whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer


Love love love love
Love love love


The question Ill ask at the end of my days
Is what did I give and what will I take


Theres only one  Theres only one  answer that matters  Answer that matters 
Even if your heart and your dreams have been shattered
Whatever you want whatever you are after
Love is still the answer
Love is still the answer


Love love love love
Love love love
Love love love love
Love love love


Love is still the answer
