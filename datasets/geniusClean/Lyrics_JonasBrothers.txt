I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film Ive seen yeah
He said Ive been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your greatgreatgreatgranddaughter
Is doin fine doin fine
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands and another one and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film Ive seen yeah woo
He said Ive been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived underwater
And your greatgreatgreatgranddaughter
Is doin fine doin fine
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multiplatinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multiplatinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
Seventh album seventh album 
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film Ive seen yeah
Ive been to the year 3000

YeahPardon my interruption
This drinks just settling in
All my reservations
A reason I dont exist
She says Can you keep a secret
A ceremony set for June
I know its a rush but I just love him so much
I hope that you can meet him soon
No I dont wanna love
If its not you
I dont wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we cant try
One last time
But I dont wanna hear the wedding bells chime
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause Im trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I dont wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells wedding bells wedding bells
Pardon my harsh reaction
You put me on the spot
And if Im being honest
Im hoping that Id get caught
Showing you Im unhappy
Letting you see my truth
Cause if you recall our anniversary falls
11 nights into June
No I dont wanna love
If its not you
I dont wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we cant try
One last time
But I dont wanna hear the wedding bells chime
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause Im trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I dont wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells
Ah ah ah ah ah
The wedding bells
The wedding bells
No I dont wanna love
If its not you
I dont wanna hear the wedding bells prove
That we cant try
One last time
But I dont wanna hear the wedding bells chime
Trying to fall asleep
You wake me up cause Im trying to see the light
Instead of you in white
No I dont wanna hear the wedding bells chime
The wedding bells

Happiness begins
Days lifted in a haze we werent just a phase
We werent just pretend  Just pretend 
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up palms out to the skies
It was fun when we were young and now were older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were upanddown and barely made it over
But Id go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now were older
Those days that are the worst they seem to glow now
We were upanddown and barely made it over
But Id go back and ride that roller coaster with you
Woooohooh wooooh
Woooohooh  Oh oh 
But Id come back and ride that roller coaster
Faith led me to the clouds reaching for the ground
Cause life was upside down
Now everything has changed we found better days
But I still hear the sound
I remember low lows and high highs
We threw our hands up palms out to the skies
It was fun when we were young and now were older
Those days when we were broke in California
We were upanddown and barely made it over
But Id go back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now were older  Oh 
Those days that are the worst they seem to glow now  Yeah 
We were upanddown and barely made it over
But Id go back and ride that roller coaster with you
Woooohooh  Yeah with you 
Wooooh  With you with you 
Woooohooh  Oh oh 
But Id come back and ride that roller coaster
It was fun when we were young and now were older  Oh 
Those days that are the worst they seem to glow now  Yeah 
We were upanddown and barely made it over
But Id go back and ride that roller coaster
Nights flying down the 10 nearly 2 AM

If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home
Ive been looking for that someone
Ill never make it on my own
Dreams cant take the place of loving you
Theres gotta be a million reasons why its true
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everythings alright
When youre right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes
How long will I be waiting
To be with you again
Im gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I cant take a day without you here
Youre the light that makes my darkness disappear
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everythings alright
When youre right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven

When you look me in the eyes
More and more I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And its all because youre by my side
When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Everythings alright
