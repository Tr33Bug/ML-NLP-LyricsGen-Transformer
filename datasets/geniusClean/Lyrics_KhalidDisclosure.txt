Know Your Worth Lyrics
He keeps leaving you for dead
I dont know what you been waiting for
So youve got your love locked up instead
But somethin betters waitin at your door
You dont know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say its not real if it doesnt hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Dont forget the words I said
Picking you up when youre feelin down
You get strung on thoughts left in your head
When you lose hope soon you will be found
You dont know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say its not real if it doesnt hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep gotta keep gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
