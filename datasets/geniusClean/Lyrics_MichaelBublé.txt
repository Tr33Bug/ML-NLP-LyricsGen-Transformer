L O V E Lyrics
L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore
And love is all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart but please dont break it
Love was made for me and you
L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore
And love is all that I can give to you
Love love love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart but please dont break it
Cause love was made for me and you
I said love was made for me and you
You know that love was made for me and you
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin on by
You know how I feel
Its a new dawn
Its a new day
Its a new life
For me
And Im feeling good
Im feeling good
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on a tree
You know how I feel
Its a new dawn
Its a new day
Its a new life
For me
And Im feeling good
Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean dont you know
Butterflies all havin fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
Thats what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me
For me
Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
Scent of the pine
You know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
Its a new dawn
Its a new day
Its a new life
Its a new dawn
Its a new day
Its a new life
Its a new dawn
Its a new day
Its a new life
Its a new life
For me
And Im feeling good
Im feeling good
I feel so good
I feel so goodIm not surprised not everything lasts
Ive broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought Id thought of every possibility
And I know some day that itll all turn out
Youll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that Ill give so much more than I get
I just havent met you yet
I might have to wait Ill never give up
I guess its half timing and the other halfs luck
Wherever you are whenever its right
Youll come out of nowhere and into my life
And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility
And somehow I know that itll all turn out
Youll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid Ill give so much more than I get
I just havent met you yet
They say alls fair in love and war
But I wont need to fight it
Well get it right and well be united
And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility
And someday I know itll all turn out
And Ill work to work it out
Promise you kid Ill give more than I get
Than I get than I get than I get
Oh you know itll all turn out
And youll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah
I just havent met you yet
I just havent met you yet
Oh promise you kid to give so much more than I get
I said love love love love love love love
I just havent met you yet
Love love love love love love love
Yeah I just havent met you yetIts beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
Its glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Theres a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well
Its the sturdy kind that doesnt mind the snow
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
Sure its Christmas once more
Another summer day has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome but I wanna go home mmm
May be surrounded by a million people I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh I miss you you know
And Ive been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
Im fine baby how are you
Well I would send them but I know that its just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another aeroplane another sunny place
Im lucky I know but I wanna go home
Mmm I got to go home
Let me go home
Im just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
And I feel just like Im living someone elses life
Its like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
That this was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day has come and gone away
In either Paris or Rome and I wanna go home
Let me go home
And Im surrounded by a million people I
I still feel alone
Oh let me go home
Oh I miss you you know
Let me go home
Ive had my run
And baby Im done
I gotta go home
Let me go home
Itll all be alright
Ill be home tonight
Im coming back homeJust because I wander round the places we would go
Hopin that Id run into you one last time
Just because I never took your picture off my phone
Doesnt mean that youre still on my mind
Just because I accidentally slip and say your name
When I hear our song it makes me insecure
Just because I know Ill never ever feel the same
Doesnt mean I love you anymore
Am I lyin to myself again
When I say youre not the best Ive ever had
Am I lyin to myself again
When I say that Im not missing you so bad
Just because Im on my knees and swearing I will change
And Id do anything to hear you say Im yours
Just because I know Ill never ever feel the same
Doesnt mean I love you anymore
Am I lyin to myself again
When I say youre not the best Ive ever had
Am I lyin to myself again
When I say that Im not missing you so bad
Just because Im on my knees and swearing I will change
And do anything to hear you say Im yours
Just because I know Ill never ever feel the same
Doesnt mean I love you anymore more
Doesnt mean I love you anymore  Anymore anymore 
Doesnt mean I love you anymore
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I grow weak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth sway me now
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me sway with me
When marimbas start to play
Hold me close make me sway
Like an ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me sway with me
Youre a falling star youre the getaway car
Youre the line in the sand when I go too far
Youre the swimming pool on an August day
And youre the perfect thing to say
And you play it coy but its kinda cute
Ah when you smile at me you know exactly what you do

Someday maybe when were old and gray
We could be in love once more

But you didnt mind no no
And Ill admit that I miss you

Santa buddy and hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa buddy a 65 convertible too steel blue
Ill wait up for you dude
Santa buddy and hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun Ive missed
Think of all the hotties that I never kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If youd check off my Christmas list
Santa pally I wanna yacht and really thats not a lot
Ive been an sweetie all year
Santa buddy so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa buddy one thing that I really do need the deed
To a platinum mine
Santa pally so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa buddy fill my stocking with Canucks tix for kicks
Throw me on the first line
Santa baby so hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Mercedes
I really I do believe in you
Now lets see if you believe in me
Santa poppy forgot to mention one little thing chaching
No I dont mean as a loan
Santa buddy so hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Oh hurry down the chimney tonight
I dont know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldnt get by by yourself
And I dont know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someones dream
Baby its fine you said that we should just be friends
Well I came up with that line and Im sure
That its for the best
If you ever change your mind dont hold your breath
Cause you may not believe
That baby Im relieved
When you said goodbye my whole world shined
Hey hey hey
Its a beautiful day and I cant stop myself from smiling
If were drinking then Im buying
And I know theres no denying
Its a beautiful day the sun is up the musics playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldnt hear this boy complaining
Cause Im glad that youre the one that got away
Its a beautiful day
Its my turn to fly so girls get in line
Cause Im easy no playing this guy like a fool
Cause now Im alright
You mightve had me caged before but not tonight
And you may not believe
That baby Im relieved
This fire inside it burns too bright
I dont want to say so long I just want to say goodbye
Its a beautiful day and I cant stop myself from smiling
If were drinking then Im buying
And I know theres no denying
Its a beautiful day the sun is up and the musics playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldnt hear this boy complaining
Cause Im glad that youre the one that got away
Cause if you ever think Ill take up
My time with thinking of our breakup
Then youve got another thing coming your way
Cause its a beautiful day
Beautiful day
Oh baby any day that youre gone away
Its a beautiful dayI just met you
It seems like yesterday
You opened up your eyes
And I recognized your face
You know that youre the one that weve been waiting for
Were gonna keep you safe
First time I held you in my arms
I knew Id love you all the way
I tuck you in at night
Another day has passed
Every week goes by a little faster than the last
It wasnt so long ago
We walked together and you held my hand
And now youre getting too big to want to
But I hope youll always understand
That Im always gonna lift you up
And Im never gonna let you down
No matter what you do
Im forever proud of you
I love you forever now
Through your ears I hear it
Through your eyes I see
A world full of magic
Full of possibilities
You know as well as anybody how tough this life can be
But youve got so much strength inside you
A strengh I pray youll never need
And Im always gonna lift you up
And Im never gonna let you down
Time flies by
I hope you realize that I
Love you forever now
Im always gonna be right here
Ill always gonna cheer you up
Im always gonna have your back
Youre never gonna be alone
And Im always gonna lift you up
No Im never gonna let you down
No matter what you do
Im forever proud of you
I love you forever now
I love you forever nowHold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose
When you kiss me Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose
When you press me to your heart
Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Im in a world apart
Je vois en rose
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose
Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle de tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose
Everytime you kiss me Heaven sighs
Il me dit des mots damour
Dont know why
Des mots de tous les jours
I close my eyes
Et a mfait quelque chose
If only you would
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose
Il est entr dans mon cur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause
Cest toi pour moi
Moi pour toi  dans la vie
Il me la dit  la jur pour la vie
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en roseTime goes by
And Ive been holding everything inside
But now Ive got nothing left to hide
When Im with you oh you
But I can see
How strong a man Im gonna have to be
To do for you what comes so naturally
Its in the way you move
And all I want
Is a chance to prove
Show all I can do
I believe in starting over
I can see that your heart is true
I believe in good things coming back to you
Youre the light that lifts me higher
So bright you guide me through
I believe in you
And I dont mind
If you want to hold onto me tight
You dont have to sleep alone tonight
If you dont want to
And all I want
Is to know youre near
Youre all I need here
I believe in starting over
I can see that your heart is true
I believe in good things coming back to you
Youre the light that lifts me higher
So bright you guide me through
I believe in you
I know that there are times
When you feel worthless
Like all the love you get
You dont deserve it
Sometimes I feel my faith is just a burden
On you you you
I believe in starting over
I can see  your heart is true
I believe in love
You give me reason to
Youre the light that lifts me higher
So high up in the sky
I I think were gonna fly
I believe in starting over
I can see that your heart is true
I believe in love
You give me reason to
Youre the light that lifts me higher
So bright you guide me through
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
Woah you guide me through
I believe in youNow you say youre lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
And now you say youre sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river
Mm cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you
You drove me
Nearly out of my head
While you never shed a tear babe
Remember
I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
Well just to prove that you do
Why dont you cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you over you
You say you love me but you lie
Now you say you love me
Well just to prove that you do
Come on and cry me a river
Oh cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river
Now you can too
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cant believe its over
I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
If Id only knew
The days were slipping past
That the good things never last
That you were crying
Summer turned to winter
And the snow it turned to rain
And the rain turned into tears upon your face
I hardly recognized the girl you are today
And God I hope its not too late
Hmmm Its not too late
Cause you are not alone
Im always there with you
And well get lost together
Til the light comes pouring through
Cause when you feel like youre done
And the darkness has won
Babe youre not lost
When your worlds crashing down
And you cant bear the thought
I said babe youre not lost
Life can show no mercy
It can tear your soul apart
It can make you feel like youve gone crazy
But youre not
Things have seemed to change
Theres one thing thats still the same
In my heart you have remained
And we can fly fly fly away
Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And well get lost together
Til the light comes pouring through
Cause when you feel like youre done
And the darkness has won
Babe youre not lost
When the worlds crashing down
And you can not bear to crawl
I said baby youre not lost
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I said baby youre not lost
I said baby youre not lost
Oh yeah yeah
I said baby youre not lostYou better not cry
You better not pout
Im telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when youre sleeping
And he knows when youre awake
He knows if youve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out

I mean a big fat man with a long white beard
Hes coming to town
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
Were happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we stroll along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Well pretend that he is Parson Brown
Hell say Are you married
Well say No man
But you can do the job
When youre in town
Later on well conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that weve made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Well pretend that he is Parson Brown
Hell say Are you ready
Well say No man
But you can do the job
When youre in town
Later on well conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that weve made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
