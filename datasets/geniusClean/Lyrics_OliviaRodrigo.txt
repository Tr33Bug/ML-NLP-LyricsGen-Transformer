I got my drivers license last week
Just like we always talked about
Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying cause you werent around
And youre probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
Shes so much older than me
Shes everything Im insecure about
Yeah today I drove through the suburbs
Cause how could I ever love someone else
And I know we werent perfect but Ive never felt this way for no one
And I just cant imagine how you could be so okay now that Im gone
Guess you didnt mean what you wrote in that song about me
Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
Cause theyll never know you the way that I do
Yeah today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we werent perfect but Ive never felt this way for no one oh
And I just cant imagine how you could be so okay now that Im gone
I guess you didnt mean what you wrote in that song about me
Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Red lights stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars front yards
Cant drive past the places we used to go to
Cause I still fuckin love you babe  Ooh oohooh ooh oohooh 
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic were laughing
Over all the noise
God Im so blue know were through
But I still fuckin love you babe  Ooh oohooh ooh oohooh 
I know we werent perfect but Ive never felt this way for no one
And I just cant imagine how you could be so okay now that Im gone
Guess you didnt mean what you wrote in that song about me
Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah you said forever now I drive alone past your streetCar rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream one spoon for two
And tradin jackets
Laughin bout how small it looks on you
Hahahaha hahahahaha hahahaha 
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein annoying singin in harmony
I bet shes braggin to all her friends sayin youre so unique hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too
She thinks its special but its all reused
That was our place I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when shes with you
Do you get dj vu when shes with you
Do you get dj vu  Ah  Hmm
Do you get dj vu huh
Do you call her almost say my name
Cause lets be honest we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
Cause you played her Uptown Girl
Youre singin it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse  Ooh I love you 
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too
She thinks its special but its all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs shes singing now when shes with you
Do you get dj vu when shes with you
Do you get dj vu  Ohoh 
Do you get dj vu
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Dont act like we didnt do that shit too
Youre tradin jackets like we used to do
Yeah everything is all reused 
Play her piano but she doesnt know  Oh oh 
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel  Oh 
A different girl now but theres nothing new
I know you get dj vu
I know you get dj vu
I know you get dj vu Ah 
Well good for you I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world
World 
And good for you I guess that youve been workin on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl  Girl 
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
Youre doin great out there without me baby
God I wish that I could do that
Ive lost my mind Ive spent the night
Cryin on the floor of my bathroom
But youre so unaffected I really dont get it
But I guess good for you
Well good for you I guess youre gettin everything you want  Ah 
You bought a new car and your careers really takin off  Ah 
Its like we never even happened
Baby what the fuck is up with that  Ah 
And good for you its like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you Well screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
Youre doin great out there without me baby
God I wish that I could do that
Ive lost my mind Ive spent the night
Cryin on the floor of my bathroom
But youre so unaffected I really dont get it
But I guess good for you
Ahahahah 
Ahahahah 
Maybe Im too emotional
But your apathys like a wound in salt
Maybe Im too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe Im too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe Im too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
Youre doin great out there without me baby
Like a damn sociopath
Ive lost my mind Ive spent the night
Cryin on the floor of my bathroom
But youre so unaffected I really dont get it
But I guess good for you
Well good for you I guess you moved on really easilyWe broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine you know I know
Youve moved on found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But shes so sweet shes so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me
Oh I hope youre happy
But not like how you were with me
Im selfish I know I cant let you go
So find someone great but dont find no one better
I hope youre happy but dont be happier
And do you tell her shes the most beautiful girl youve ever seen
An eternal love bullshit you know youll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me
And now Im pickin her apart
Like cuttin her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But shes beautiful she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies
I hope youre happy
But not like how you were with me
Im selfish I know I cant let you go
So find someone great but dont find no one better
I hope youre happy
I wish you all the best really
Say you love her baby just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope youre happy but dont be happier
Ooh oohooh
Oohooh oohooh
I hope youre happy
Just not like how you were with me
Im selfish I know cant let you go
So find someone great but dont find no one better
I hope youre happy but dont be happier
I found a guy told me I was a star
He held the door held my hand in the dark
And hes perfect on paper but hes lying to my face
Does he think that Im the kinda girl who needs to be saved
And theres one more boy hes from my past
We fell in love but it didnt last
Cause the second I figure it out he pushes me away
And I wont fight for love if you wont meet me halfway
And I say that Im through but this songs still for you
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask
Is it something wrong with me
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high
Try my best but what can I say
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldnt that be enough for me
Oohoohoohooh oohooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after it dont come so easily
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask
Is it something wrong with me Oh ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high
Try my best but what can I say
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay
Oohoohooh
Ahahahahah
Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies yeah
I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And aint it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits
And aint it funny how you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell dont look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that youll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst but that didnt matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didnt cheat but youre still a traitor
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like shes a new trophy
And I know if you were true theres no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
And aint it funny All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Aint it funny Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid
You betrayed me
And I know that youll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst but that didnt matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didnt cheat but youre still a traitor
Ahahah 
God I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
Ahahah 
When shes sleepin in the bed we made
Dont you dare forget about the way
You betrayed me
Cause I know that youll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word but that didnt matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didnt cheat but youre still youre still a traitor
Ahahah 
Yeah youre still a traitor
Oohoohooh
God I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with youI want it to be like messy
Im so insecure I think
That Ill die before I drink
And Im so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And Im so tired that I might
Quit my job start a new life
And theyd all be so disappointed
Cause who am I if not exploited
And Im so sick of seventeen
Wheres my fucking teenage dream
If someone tells me one more time
Enjoy your youth Im gonna cry
And I dont stick up for myself
Im anxious and nothing can help
And I wish Id done this before
And I wish people liked me more
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get
Unrelentlessly upset  Ahahah 
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God its brutal out here
Yeah 
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way Im perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately Im a nervous wreck
Cause I love people I dont like
And I hate every song I write
And Im not cool and Im not smart
And I cant even parallel park
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get
Unrelentlessly upset  Ahahah 
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God its brutal out here
Yeah 
Just havin a really good time 
Got a broken ego broken heart
Yeah its brutal out here yeah its brutal out here 
And God I dont even know where to startKnow that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doeeyed as you buried me
One heart broke four hands bloody
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well I hope I was your favorite crime
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondr if youre around
Cause you know that Id do it all again
All the things I did
Just so I could call you min
The things you did
Well I hope I was your favorite crime
Its bittersweet to think about the damage that wed do
Cause I was goin down but I was doin it with you
Yeah everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh look what we became
All the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
All the things you did
Well I hope I was your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
Cause baby you were mineI kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paperwhite teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didnt care
I know their beautys not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I cant let it go
Comcomparison is killin me slowly

My jealousy jealousy started followin me  Hehehe he

Anyone anyone else
Jealousy jealousy started followin meCalled you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like am I pretty Am I fun boy
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff
Cause its always one step forward and three steps back
Im the love of your life until I make you mad
Its always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me want me hate me
Boy I dont understand
No I dont understand
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like which lover will I get today
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying
Its one step forward and three steps back
Im the love of your life until I make you mad
Its always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me want me hate me
Boy I dont understand
No its back and forth did I say something wrong
Its back and forth going over everything I said
Its back and forth did I do something wrong
Its back and forth maybe this is all your fault instead
Its one step forward and three steps back
And Id leave you but the rollercoasters all Ive ever had
Yeah its one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me want me hate me
Boy I dont understand
No I dont understand
I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves cause of his dad
And somehow we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Dont know if Ill see you again someday
But if youre out there I hope that youre okay
My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hr own
Her parents hated who sh loved
She couldnt wait to go to college
She was tired cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
We dont talk much but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that youre okay
Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothings forever nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds wont iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close
Well I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But God I hope that youre happier today
Cause I love you
And I hope that youre okay
I wore makeup when we dated
Cause I thought youd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say youre not the compliment type
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your selfhelp books
So youd think that I was smart
Stupid emotional obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how youd leave
You found someon more exciting the nxt second you were gone
And you left me there cryin wonderin what I did wrong
And you always say Im never satisfied but I dont think thats true
Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And maybe Im just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God you couldnt have cared less
About someone who loved you more
Id say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I dont want your sympathy
I just want myself back
Before you found someone more exciting the next second you were gone
And you left me there cryin wonderin what I did wrong
And you always say Im never satisfied but I dont think thats true
Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
And dont you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded
Dont you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing
But dont tell me youre sorry boy
Feel sorry for yourself
Cause someday Ill be everything to somebody else
And theyll think that I am so exciting
And youll be the one whos crying
Yeah you always say Im never satisfied but I dont think thats true
You say Im never satisfied but thats not me its you
Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I dont think anything could ever be enough for you
Enough for you oh
No nothings enough for youNot long ago when I saw you there
With your browneyed grin and your messy hair
And every girl at the party was looking at you  Ooh ooh ooh 
I wonder what Id say if I knew back then
That the browneyed boyd be my best friend
And the one Id give my heart to  Ooh ooh ooh 
Now everything reminds me of you
Your pictures framed all over my room
And if I hate someone youll hate em too
As long as Im your darling angel
I dont need anything in the world
Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that Im your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs Ill take the lows
Ill keep you close give you the most
Oh baby I like you so much its kinda gross
Yeah I like you so much its kinda gross
And driving in your car I feel all grown up
Is it me or does it feel more than high school love
Not gonna lie your last name sounds so nice
I love when you complain about things like traffic
Love when youre tired baby I like all of it
Honestly I cant believe youre mine
I bring you up in every conversation
Were young I know we gotta be patient
But I know I want my life to have you in it
Ooh and as long as Im your darling angel
I dont need anything in the world
Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that Im your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs Ill take the lows
Ill keep you close give you the most
Oh baby I like you so much its kinda gross
Yeah I like you so much its kinda gross
All my life Ive seen myself through your eyes
Wonderin if I am good enough for your time
You love me but for all the wrong reasons
Am I somethin to you and not someone
Cause I feel trapped on this pedestal you put me on
You tell me that Im beautiful but I think thats an understatement
Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say Im perfect but Ive got thorns with my petals too
And I wont be confined to your point of view
Im breakin through the glass you put me in
Cause my beautys from within
Ohoh ohohohoh
My beautys from within
Ohoh ohohoh
So I am done livin my lif just for you
You watched me wither and now youll watch m bloom
Youre hidin in the dark but Im reachin for the sun wooooh
Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say Im pretty but Ive got magic that you never knew
And I wont be confined to your point of view
Im breakin through the glass you put me in
Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say Im perfect but Ive got thorns with my petals too
And I wont be confined to your point of view
Im breakin through the glass you put me in
Cause my beautys from within
Yeah you must think youre funny calling him at ten oclock
You think he thinks youre pretty I can guarantee he does not
I know you see me do you think that you can win this game
Yeah you must think youre so attractive when youre playing dumb
The only thing youre showing him is how desperate youve become
I hope you trip over the boundaries that youve stepped right over
But go ahead and shoot your shot
Baby let me know how it goes
Know him better than you thought
And I think you should know
Youre his apocalyptic crush
Hed like you only if there was
No one left on Earth
Babe Im sorry if that hurts
But hes mine until then
Youre his apocalyptic crush
If we all died youd be the one
Whod get to kiss him in the ashes
So hey what are the chances of World War III
Cause hes never gonna like you like he likes me
Strange strange strange
Strange strange strange
Oh no your voice through the phone
Tells me way more than Ive ever wanted to know
You say that you need your space
And letting me go was the hardest thing you could do
Cause youre crazy for me
And Im the best that you ever had hmm
Its kinda funny
Said it was raining but the suns out
You said you loved me youre with her now
And I dont need you to explain
Im just saying that its strange  Oohooh 
You said you couldnt live without me  Oohooh 
Heard youre dancing at a party  Oohooh 
And I dont wanna take her place  Oohooh 
Im just saying that its strang  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Strang strange strange  Oohooh 
Oh no I saw you and her out on the street
You were never that public with me
I know that you met her when you were with me
You said I had doubts
And you said I was crazy baby
Was I crazy after all Oh
Its really funny
Said it was raining but the suns out
You said you loved me youre with her now
And I dont need you to explain
Im just saying that its strange  Oohooh 
You said you couldnt live without me  Oohooh 
Heard youre dancing at a party  Oohooh 
And I dont wanna take her place  Oohooh 
Im just saying that its strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Im just saying that its strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Oh no guess I was right
Wish I was wrong
Me and my heart will be fine
Said it was raining but the suns out
You said you loved me youre with her now
And I dont need you to explain
Im just saying that its strange  Oohooh 
You said you couldnt live without me  Oohooh 
Heard youre dancing at a party  Oohooh 
And I dont wanna take her place  Oohooh 
Im just saying that its strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Im just saying that its strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Strange strange strange  Oohooh 
Long blonde hair daddys a millionaire
Nobody knows her but everybody wants to
Thats what I see
Europe trips kissing the dream boys lips
Successful with a smile
Shes everything that Ill never be
Twentyfirst century girls are perfect
And I know it isnt real its all so stupid
But digital love it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel its what theyll believe
Twentyfirst century girls are flawless
And I say I didnt care but if I am honest
Its hard not to feel like Im never enough
Yeah I want that twentyfirst century love
Feels like Im not where Im supposed to be
I dont fit in with these familiar faces
And the games they play dont mean a thing to me
I know theres so much more
I cant stop dreamin and thinkin
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
If I leave this Im riskin almost everything
Am I on the right road
Outta the old Ive gotta find my way
Into the new give anything it takes
I wanna know if no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home
If I go out of the old  Ayo ayo 
And into the new  Ayo ayo 
Out of the old  Ayo ayo 
And into the new  Ayo ayo 
Yeah I wanna know  Ayo ayo 
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home
Out of the old
I wish these streets were still enough for me
I wish this town could give me everything
But I still feel stopped while every light turns green
Why cant I let it go
I cant stop dreamin and thinkin
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
Leavin all this Im riskin almost everything
But theres only one road
Outta the old Ive gotta find my way
Into the new give anything it takes
I wanna know if no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home
If I go out of the old  Ayo ayo 
And into the new  Ayo ayo 
Out of the old  Ayo ayo 
And into the new  Ayo ayo 
Yeah I wanna know  Ayo ayo 
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home  Ayo ayo 
Out of the old  Ayo ayo 
And into the new  Ayo ayo 
Take me out of the old  Ayo ayo 
And into the new  Ayo ayo 
Cause I wanna go
I wanna go
Mmm
Just take meSo much has happened think of what weve done
In the time that the Earth has traveled round the Sun
Winter spring summer and were back to fall
Weve been together handinhand through it all
From the minute we kissed and my heart skipped a beat
To the night that we danced I was swept off my feet
Sure as every year has to come to an end
Id go spinnin round the Sun with you again and again
And again and again
I think I kinda you know
I think I kinda you know
Like the way that we flow
Like the way that we go
And I love
I think I kinda you know
I think I kinda you know you know you know
I cant help dreamin of you
Guess Im sayin I dont not love you
You know you know you know
Sit in your car wait in the dark
Radio is up and so is your guard
You dont know what to say
Youre faking a smile you say that youre fine
And maybe itll all work out in time
Youve always been good that way
Feel like Ive done this before
Youre fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry cause I wasnt enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
You told me your past
You hated your dad
And when you left college couldnt wait to go back
Cause you really trusted me
And what did I do What did I do
I built you up abandoned you
And Im too proud to say sorry
Feel like Ive done this before
Youre fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry cause I wasnt enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
I didnt mean it baby
I didnt think it all through
I didnt mean it baby
Always ruin good things like you
I watched the life drain out of your eyes
And its no surprise
Its no surprise
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
Now I watch you cry cause I wasnt enough
I watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry cause I wasnt enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
The ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
