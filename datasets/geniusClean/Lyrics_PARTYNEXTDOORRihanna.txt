First you gotta forgive me
Let me know everything gon be okay
Even if I come out with everything I did
Would you still punish me even though I did it a long time ago
If so let me know
If I propose would you say no
Would you break my heart
Would you embarrass me or play your part
Baby dont fold my heart is yours
You got the power pussy power

The floor is yours the time is ours
Hey either believe me or you dont
Choose to believe me or you wont
If you leave me Im skull and bones Im dead baby
