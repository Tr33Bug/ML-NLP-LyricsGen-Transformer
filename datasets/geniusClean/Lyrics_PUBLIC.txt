Make You Mine Lyrics
Well I will call you darlin and everything will be okay
Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine
Doesnt matter anyway
In the night well take a walk its nothin funny
Just to talk
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I wont stop until I make you mine
You know that I wont stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Well I have called you darlin and Ill say it again again
So kiss me til Im sorry babe that you are gone and Im a mess
And Ill hurt you and youll hurt me and well say things we cant repeat
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I wont stop until I make you mine
You know that I wont stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
You need to know
Well take it slow
I miss you so
Well take it slow
Its hard to feel you slipping  You need to know 
Through my fingers are so numb  Well take it slow 
And how was I supposed to know  I miss you so 
That you were not the one
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
You know that I wont stop until I make you mine
You know that I wont stop until I make you mine
Until I make you mine
Put your hand in mine
You know that I want to be with you all the time
Oh darlin darlin baby youre so very fine
You know that I wont stop until I make you mine

LalalalalaSuch a pretty face
You see her walking around
In the middle of the night
In her wedding gown
Says that she can do it but
Is she trying
Beautiful girl
Hasnt grown up yet
And shes wasting all her feelings on
A boy shes never met
Says that she is happy but
Is she lying
Running and shes running again
Shes trying to understand but she cant
Running and shes running again
Shes crying by herself cause she can
Do you know her
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you
Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
Its the middle of the night
And nobody makes a sound
Says that she can do it but
Is she lying
Running and shes running again
Shes trying to understand but she cant
Running and shes running again
Shes crying by herself cause she can
Do you know her
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you
And would you be there
To help her push on through
And would you know her
If she didnt know you
Are we enoough
Do we measure up
Are we enough
Do we measure up
Such a pretty face
You see her walking around
Oh shes such a pretty face
Do you know her
The girl that looks to you
And would you love her
The way that she loved you
And would you be there
To help her push on through
And would you know her
If she didnt know you
Woooah

Anything more than that girl that I need
Oh

And you dont have to be anything more than that girl

Things dont seem right
And I know its hard to see
That youre doing fine
If you just take your time
Then you see what I can see
Cause I know what youre feelin
When everything is wrong
When coffee burns your tongue yeah
Youve got to keep on breathing
Fire in your lungs fire in your lungs oh
And its okay to cry
But I look in your eyes say

And you dont have to be
Anything more than that girl that I need
Oh

And you dont have to be anything more than that girl
Youre perfect to me
I know that it seems like youve got to hide
Youve gotta look like a plastic doll
Be funny and sweet and smile with your teeth
If you want to be heard at all
But that is all wrong
What they think is real
I know is fake
So make no mistake
So chin up and listen to me
Oh no

And you dont have to be
Anything more than that girl that I need
Oh

Anything more than that girl that I need
Oh

And you dont have to be
Anything more
Than that girl
Youre perfect to meIts cold up north
Youre a thousand miles away
And I think of you a lot
I know Im yours
Doesnt mean it doesnt hurt
And my stomachs in a knot
Im tired of talking on the phone in my room
Speaking till the words run out
And I know that youre impatient too
I just need to be with you right now
Im missing you today your kiss is far away
Im gonna hold you soon
And I need you to know that Im missing you
Say Were gonna be okay
Im gonna see you soon
And I need you to know that Im missing you today
Im missing you today

You send  you send  three hearts  three hearts 
But everythings a tease when my lips aint touching yours
I hate this feeling like Im suffocating while Im breathin
Like were just hitting a wall oh
Im tired of talking on the phone in my room
Speaking till the words run out  speaking till the words 
And I know that youre impatient too
I just need to be with you right now
Im missing you today your kiss is far away

And I need you to know that Im missing you

And I need you to know that Im missing youTrying to go through my day like a normal day
Looking at stars cause Im trying to wish you away
I dont like the thought of a memory making me tense
The only thing worse is when I had to deal with your friends
Im moving on so Im done with you
But youre still in my head
So tell me what do I do
Keep you out of my thoughts
And youll stay away
But youre burnin through  youre burnin though 
Im moving on so Im done with you
But youre still in my head
So tell me what do I do
I wish I could say Im never thinking of you
But I still do
And oh oh oh oh oh
Youre on my mind
And oh oh oh oh oh
Youre on my mind yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh
Youre on my mind
Tryin to go through my day like a normal day
Lookin through pictures but fightin to throw them away
I dont like the thought of a memory making me tense
Avoiding your name all together just might make more sense
Im moving on so Im done with you
But youre still in my head
So tell me what do I do
Keep you out of my thoughts
And youll stay away
But youre burnin through
Youre burnin though
Im moving on so Im done with you
But youre still in my head
So tell me what do I do
I wish I could say Im never thinking of you
But I still do

Tryin to go through my day like a normal day
Lookin at stars because Im trying to wish you awayPut on a face made of plastic
And hide my fears behind a silhouette
I act like Im fine when Im hurtin
Simple to smile but so hard to forget
No I cant forget
When I close my eyes
I know I wont sleep
While shes tryna take
A bite out of me
When I close my eyes
I know I wont sleep
I just overthink
All my friends are tellin me no
But Im already trapped between her teeth
All my friends are begging me Dont go
Shes a little monster underneath
But I still need my little drama queen
And I cant leave my little drama queen
All my friends are tellin me no
But whats the worst that you could do to me
Little drama queen
Afraid to pull back the curtain
Around my mind cause I know its a mess
Why cant I tell them Im breakin
Easy to lie and hide that Im upset
But I cant forget
When I close my eyes  I cant forget 
I know I wont sleep  I cant forget 
While shes tryna take
A bite out of me  I cant forget 
When I close my eyes  I cant forget 
I know I wont sleep  I cant forget 
I just overthink ohoh
All my friends are tellin me no
But Im already trapped between her teeth
All my friends are begging me Dont go
Shes a little monster underneath
But I still need my little drama queen
And I cant leave my little drama queen
All my friends are tellin me no
But whats the worst that you could do to me
Little drama queen
Little drama queen
Little drama queen
Little little
Little drama queen
Little little 
I cant forget

All my friends are tellin me no
But Im already trapped between her teeth
All my friends are begging me Dont go
Shes a little monster underneath
But I still need my little drama queen
And I cant leave my little drama queen
All my friends are tellin me no
But whats the worst that you could do to me
Little drama queen
Queen 
Little drama queen little drama queen
Queen 
Little little
Little drama queenAnd I I may be better on my own
But inside my bones are made of sticks and stones
But theres a hole in my head
Where I live til I die
Always running through the dark
Cant get out of my mind
But you numb the pain
My sugarcane sweet lemonade
Dont want to live forever
Think we could die together
Now this is now or never
Think we could die together
You numb the pain
My sugarcane sweet lemonade
Dont want to live forever
And I try but the worst gets the best of me
I wear my heart on my sleeve
But its just a cuff link
I can say what I feel
I dont know what I think
But you numb the pain
My sugarcane sweet lemonade
Dont want to live forever
Think we could die together
Now this is now or never
Think we could die together
You numb the pain
My sugarcane sweet lemonade
Dont want to live forever
Lovin you like sugarcane
Sippin you like lemonade
Lovin you like sugarcane
Sippin you like lemonade  sugarcane 
Dont want to live forever
Think we could die together
Now this is now or never
Think we could die together
You numb the pain
My sugarcane sweet lemonade
Dont want to live foreverDont say it again
Youre not my lover
Youre no longer a friend
And I cant pretend
That it wont destroy me when I see you again
Dont say it again
Youre not my lover
Youre no longer a friend
And I cant pretend
That it wont destroy me when I see you again
But what is talk
Talk is cheap
The words we say
Are sounding so empty
I love you
Only hurts when its coming from you
I love you
Only hurts only hurts
I love you
Only hurts when its coming from you
I love you
Only hurts only hurts
Dont say it again
Im trying to move on but youre still in my head
And I cant pretend
That I wont be haunted by the things that we said
Dont say it again
Youre not my lover
Youre no longer a friend
And I cant pretend
That it wont destroy me when I see you again
But what is talk

Hot flashes coming when we see the dark patches of your mind
