 Shout out my nigga Synco 


Uh  Tuned up  copped a BMW new deposit I picked up another bag
Like fuck it Ima count while Im in it
I hear planes flyin crowds screamin money counters chains clangin
Shit I guess thats how it sound when you winnin
I aint jokin do it sound like Im kiddin
I been makin like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds I was swimmin
Im probably gon drown when Im in it
I bet she gon get loud when Im in it
And we might have a child when Im finished

Uh I wont love a ho after we fuck she cant get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri yes Im winnin clearly
Im the chosen one seen my potential so they fear me
Lately Ive been prayin God I wonder can You hear me
Thinkin bout the old me I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down til you come up Ive been stickin to that theory
Every day a battle Im exhausted and Im weary
Make sure I smile in public when alone my eyes teary
I fought through it all but that shit hurt me severely
Ive been gettin high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin different pills but I know it aint gon


Uh copped a BMW new deposit I picked up another bag
Like fuck it Ima count while Im in it
I hear planes flyin crowds screamin money counters chains clangin
Shit I guess thats how it sound when you winnin
I aint jokin do it sound like Im kiddin
I been makin like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds I was swimmin
Im probably gon drown when Im in it
I bet she gon get loud when Im in it  Uh uh 
And we might have a child when Im finished


They say Im Pac rebirth never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk Ima step til my feet hurt
Been puttin them streets first
White tees turned burgundy tshirts
Lookin for somethin real he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin me I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if Im okay it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin so deep into your eyes I can read your thoughts so
Shut the fuck I mean please dont talk
I done been through too much and I dont need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought


Uh copped a BMW new deposit I picked up another bag
Like fuck it Ima count while Im in it
I hear planes flyin crowds screamin money counters chains clangin
Shit I guess thats how it sound when you winnin
I aint jokin do it sound like Im kiddin
I been makin like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds I was swimmin
Im probably gon drown when Im in it
I bet she gon get loud when Im in it
And we might have a child when Im finished

When Im finished when Im finishedJD On Tha Track
Iceberg want a bag bitch


We pop out at your party Im with the gang
And its gon be a robbery so tuck ya chain
Im a killer girl Im sorry but I cant change
We aint aimin for your body shots hit your brain
We come from poverty man we aint have a thing
Its a lot of animosity but they wont say my name
Them killers rock with me lil nigga dont get banged
Cause theyll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

She dont like her body left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker ladies love me like Im Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga but its too late
Booked a flight to Cali racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie they in HD like its BluRay
The way that I been ballin should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin on the gang thats gon only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down better tighten up yo shoe lace
Lil bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray


We pop out at your party Im with the gang
And its gon be a robbery so tuck ya chain
Im a killer girl Im sorry but I cant change
We aint aimin for your body shots hit your brain
We come from poverty man we aint have a thing
Its a lot of animosity but they wont say my name
Them killers rock with me lil nigga dont get banged
Cause theyll do that job for me while I hop on a plane


I call lil bro he said he ready for the stain  Said he ready for the stain 
What you claim You a lame you aint never put in pain  Put in pain 
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang  They go crazy for the game 
If I showed you all my charges you wont look at me the same  You wont look at me the same 
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make  Wish I never had to make 
Lost my brother seen him die and I just seen him graduate  I just seen him graduate 
Got that 40 on my side and Im just rollin past the jakes  Im just rollin past jakes 
Both my hands can do the job and I aint talkin masturbate
I was in and outta state  State  cause I had a bag to make  Bag to make 
I risked my life but its aight cause God aint let me pass away  Pass away 
Fuck tomorrow spin the block just know we comin back today  Back today 
I call Polo he come dolo we get em the fast way


We pop out at your party Im with the gang
And its gon be a robbery so tuck ya chain
Im a killer girl Im sorry but I cant change
We aint aimin for your body shots hit your brain
We come from poverty man we aint have a thing
Its a lot of animosity but they wont say my name
Them killers rock with me lil nigga dont get banged
Cause theyll do that job for me while I hop on a plane Tahj Money 
 I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw hey Lilkdubb 


I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth
Girl I cant wait til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days girl you still kind of cute
If it go down Im gon protect you pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love I cant see no bitch after you
Off emotions we did things that we didnt have to do
Scared of you leaving I told lies when you asked for the truth
I secondguessed if you the one thats when I didnt have a clue
They be Martin and Gina but we aint think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it lose her voice when she tryin to scream
We from the trenches we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from HM to a designer fiend

He was playing games got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling and its liquor in your cup all you really want is love
Baby all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses independent cant be fucking with a scrub
Girl I know you cant be fucking with a scrub  Kdubb 


I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man Im tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali in my mansion takin care of me
I know sometime Im crazy I was hopin you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred never change up
In that sundress damn your body so amazing
Love the way you smell Im addicted to your fragrance
Its somethin about you but I really cant explain it
Just know that you mine I tell that nigga he can save it


He was playing games got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling and its liquor in your cup all you really want is love
Baby all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses independent cant be fucking with a scrub
Girl I know you cant be fucking with a scrub

Always shouting out my block cause bitch thats where I started
Ahead of my class yeah I always been the smartest  Bitch 
Aint no competition even though they try they hardest
I know they be hating but Im in my bag regardless  Flex 
Give this shit a year or two lets see who get the farthest
Dont play in these streets before you turn into a target  Boom boom boom 
You could think you crazy but my shorties get retarded
If I call up CCB they scoring like they cant be guarded bitch
That AR be shooting I call it GUnit cause you know that bitch stay with 50
Hairtrigger just tap it dont pull it aint saving no bullets I shoot til its empty

Had to cancel my old bitch she was choosing I aint tripping Ion miss her cause a thot gon be a thot  Haha 
Niggas from the other side dissing my homies I aint tripping just gon kill him cause a opp gon be a opp  Bitch 
Fuck that Wawa shit we dont social beef we grab Glocks

Feel like Jordan vs Utah Im deadly with that last shot  Bitch 
Back to poking niggas if I lose everything that I got
You keep flicking up with them rolls then we might have to enter yo slot
Put that barrel on yo head take yo new chain and yo watch  Pussy 
I been Td since I got that news my homie dead
Caught yo homie lacking  Bop knocked off his dread 
Just for satisfaction well come take off a nigga head  Haha 
Hollows like a deadly virus bodies drop when that shit spread
Explode in his flesh make a mess get ripped to shreds
Show no mercy for the enemy nobody getting spared
Man you niggas bitches why the fuck would I be scared

I aint stoppin til we chillin at the top


Swervin on the Eway dont care if I crash in this coupe
Shit Im thinkin bout too real might lose my mind in this coupe
Cant relapse off these drugs man RIP to Juice
We was tweakin off them Percs I popped my last one with you
Bond tight with my day ones aint tryna find no recruits
We was playin give and take on that front line with my troops
Ayy like who want smoke We got plenty guns
Keep two lil savages on X and they gon get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery they gon clip his lungs
It was goin down on the set thats when this shit was fun
I just been ballin on these niggas like Im Kendrick Nunn
Every day my birthday bitch its lit I just turned twentyone

Decorate your block with red tape foenem slidin every day
Bunch of hollows spittin out the Glock

Ever since I stepped up in this game Ive been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches tryna see a life beyond that
Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga where Im from they turn death into a contest
Livin by the gun put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war but they aint get no Vietnam check
Lil bro want his head he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil bitch Im from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets shit got me singin gang blues

He the type to get excited cause he made The Shade Room


Decorate your block with red tape foenem slidin every day
Bunch of hollows spittin out the Glock

Live in the flesh


Know my grandma still with me when it get cold I feel your spirit
Talkin to my lil sister phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles see my mama her eyes tearin
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something its all about persevering
They was counting me out I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah I know that they hate Im the man aint tryna hear it

Phone on DND Im out in Cali whippin through the mountains
Just cruisin feelin my song windows down speakers pounding yeah
My engine roaring and that Gucci tiger growling
Expensive taste my clothes foreign I be dripping like a fountain
Need new shoes I started hustling cause I didnt get no allowance
Speeding down the wrong path found my lane then I rerouted
Hottest in my city I had every record label scouting
I got rich and left the hood still dont leave the crib without it
Swear it aint no better feeling than thumbing through these thousands
So much money cant keep track I think I might need an accountant
I been runnin up that check them blue hundreds just keep piling
Came a long way from depression all these riches keep me smiling


Know my grandma still with me when it get cold I feel your spirit
Talkin to my lil sister phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles see my mama her eyes tearin
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something its all about persevering
They was counting me out I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah I know that they hate Im the man aint tryna hear it


Couldnt leave my brother in them trenches told him come and stay with me
We gon live like kings for all them nights aint have no place to sleep
Niggas watched us starving and never offered us a plate to eat
Took off now they mad but I know that they wont wait for me
Last year I took a trip to every place that I couldnt wait to see
Granny Im locked up again sat in that station faithfully
Now Im the golden child I used to think my mama hated me
Aint budging bout no problems what a nigga gon come take from me
I heard you a robber on that concrete you gon lay deceased
This 40 waving like a blowdryer gon hit his face with heat
With this shit for life forever gang until Im 83
Real niggas dyin it seem like Heaven is the place to be


Know my grandma still with me when it get cold I feel your spirit
Talkin to my lil sister phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles see my mama her eyes tearin
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something its all about persevering
They was counting me out I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah I know that they hate Im the man aint tryna hear itYeah I know

For generations bitch my side of town been drillin

Lately Ive been feelin like fuck the streets this shit a scam
These days if it aint bout money I dont give a damn
Im just gon get rich and fuck them plastic hoes on Instagram
Still with the gang though one false move them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say they look for me
I aint sacrifice the shit I lost it was took from me
Almost went insane went insane went insane
From all this pain all this pain all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me they keep me laughin
Sippin on this codeine got me relaxin
She say she like how I be swaggin she love my fashion

Bondin over drugs and pain dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she dont fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare
Left us behind you seen that light glare
I know you walkin up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I cant just pull up to your crib and see you right there
Nobody love you til you dead thats when they might care

Lets just be friends before we rush into a label
Wanna know if you really fuck with me girl whats your angle
Its only for the better if Im tryna change you
Lovin me aint easy if you leave I dont blame you
Trauma got me fucked up so Im mentally unstable
I got wrapped up in my emotions now Im tangled
Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin can get painful
Watch how I move one wrong decision can be fatal
Hidden messages conversations with my angels
Just walk with me and youll see Im tryna save you
Most times Im by myself Im still confused from betrayal
From rags to riches shit still hard Im just on phase two


Bondin over drugs and pain dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she dont fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare
Left us behind you seen that light glare
I know you walkin up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I cant just pull up to your crib and see you right there
Nobody love you til you dead thats when they might care


Livin on his own and he runnin out of options now
Cause he felt like he couldnt be hisself at his mama house
Hittin licks missin school junior year he thought bout droppin out
Him against the world 40 on him when he poppin out
On his dark road he just tryna find a proper route
Hate the criticism he uses music to block it out
By his auntie he was molested as a baby boy
Messed up his head it even changed the way he play with toys
Up late night rappin and they told him to quit makin noise
Stuck in his feelings he be spendin every day annoyed
He wanna stand over a nigga leave his face destroyed
He miss his hood now this something that he cant avoid


Bondin over drugs and pain dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she dont fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare
Left us behind you seen that light glare
I know you walkin up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I cant just pull up to your crib and see you right there
Nobody love you til you dead thats when they might care Dmac on the fuckin track

Im so sick of farewells and RIPs
In the trenches yellin Gang gang mob ties what I bleed
Dont claim to be an opp cause niggas die from that disease
He gon let that 9 blow with ease
Can I speak my mind can I breathe
I know she might cry if I leave
I been fooled by liars and thieves
Iced out my Rollie but I know time cannot freeze

Once you give my pussy up its over with
Miss who you used to be cause thats who I was closer with
Im in my bag now I act like I dont know the bitch
Before I knew what platinum was was tryna go on hits
Well if he act like he bout it then put him on the list
You better pick out a casket cause they goin quick
They gassed him up now tears sheddin when they post his pic
I know bout some flukey shit I heard he died on a lick
My whole squad scorin bitch we dont do no assists
Potential wasted couldnt stay in his lane he aint know his niche
Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick
Every day a gamble with your life all we know is risk
From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit


Im so sick of farewells and RIPs
In the trenches yellin Gang gang mob ties what I bleed
Dont claim to be an opp cause niggas die from that disease
He gon let that 9 blow with ease
Can I speak my mind can I breathe
I know she might cry if I leave
I been fooled by liars and thieves
Iced out my Rollie but I know time cannot freeze


Switches on them glizzys get to blowin like its four of me
Promise to my son that the streets wont get no more of me
Remember every line from that obituary poetry
See they peep Im ballin now just go back to ignorin me
Always gotta spazz unleash the beast when they recordin me
Lord Im tryna take it easy on em but they forcin me
See him in person and that boy wont stand on shit he been sayin
Pop shit like Taliban loadin up them sticks in a van
You know its fuck the other side cause my niggas gone
Always been fuck the other side we dont get along
If we bump heads like Marvin Gaye lets get it on
Aim for the head that chopper spray we get em gone
Independent her hair down and she feelin grown
Tryna correct her flaw she filled with silicone
And she aint all innocent she did a nigga wrong
I got a playlist for your heart girl pick a song


Im so sick of farewells and RIPs
In the trenches yellin Gang gang mob ties what I bleed
Dont claim to be an opp cause niggas die from that disease
He gon let that 9 blow with ease
Can I speak my mind can I breathe
I know she might cry if I leave
I been fooled by liars and thieves
Iced out my Rollie but I know time cannot freeze Mustard on the beat ho 


My youngins heartless so they aint playin no games
We really want em dead he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head he wanna see some more brains
On that corner I couldnt stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin cocaine
She an Instagram addict she want more fame
I used to starve now Im blowing up like propane
Told my inner self I promise you I wont change

We make it hot up on your block we let that heat blow
Catch an opp we dump the clip its time to reload
Put a scope on the AR just like a peephole
Think he a bully we got choppers for the Deebo
Sevenfigure nigga tryna maximize them three Os
Before the bag I was fucking all the freak hoes
Ballin hard young legend out the Chi bitch Im like DRose
Cap how you make it out this shit I got the cheat code
Way more than life than just the hood Im tryna reach goals
Maxine my heart since youve been gone I miss your sweet soul ayy
Never tell a statement we wont leak those
Better not go talkin to them people better keep closed


My youngins heartless so they aint playin no games
We really want em dead he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head he wanna see some more brains
On that corner I couldnt stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin cocaine
She an Instagram addict she want more fame
I used to starve now Im blowing up like propane
Told my inner self I promise you I wont change


We hold a grudge and we want blood we cant look past the issue
Play with us and you gon die nigga its kinda simple
Show no mercy we gon kill whoever ridin with you
Catch you on the other side then we gon have to get you
Condolences to your family they gon have to miss you
Lil Joe on go and he gon spark thats if I pass the signal
My righthand mans he got his name cause he gon blast the pistol
Earned our stripes we gon blow if a nigga play foul you would think we had a whistle
Lil Capalot GOAT yeah thats that guys initials
Happiness and depression Im stuck inside the middle
I fell in love with dollar signs wont let my mind forget you
Fuck it off we spend it all on fast cars and shinin crystals


My youngins heartless so they aint playin no games
We really want em dead he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head he wanna see some more brains
On that corner I couldnt stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin cocaine
She an Instagram addict she want more fame
I used to starve now Im blowing up like propane
Told my inner self I promise you I wont changeJTK


You broke that bond now when it come to you my feelings weak
You let your selfish ways come in between our chemistry
Why you play with my heart and not show love consistently
I put my life on the line you wouldnt take that risk for me
Fucked up my trust wish I could delete all our memories
Keep poppin these pills I hope it take away my misery
I got a dead soul I been facing blunts of my enemies
Emotions bottled up I dont know whats wrong and its killing me
I cut so many off my heart cold as December be
My mind keep racing I been overthinking I dont get no sleep
You dont understand how hard it was I swear this shit so deep
I made it to the top and they all looked up in disbelief
They hate that Im doin better theyd much rather get rid of me
I flex with no regrets cause they aint show me no sympathy
I came a long way but I aint as far as Im finna be
I promise Ima die a legend Ima make sure that you remember me
I used to daydream I pictured everything so vividly
I had a feeling wed be rich since the elementary
My peoples gone got to witness everything they aint get to see
Long live Maxine I miss your love wish you was here with me
You was a part of me and since you left Im incomplete
My lifestyle used to be jump shots and sticking D
Life overwhelmed me I said fuck school and hit the streets
I devoted my life to that corner just so I can get a G
Fuck a twofour nigga I aint been home and its been a week
We used to break down eightballs wishing we could get a key
Was tryna duck that indictment the feds did a sweep
I hope you grippin on your gun when them drillers creep
Lil nigga grabbed his first glizzy went on a killing spree
Caught him at that red light snoozin he thought this shit was sweet
If he come from that other side we make him rest in peace
Im way too solid for the gimmicks fuck the industry
Told em I was gonna be somethin
That broke shit made me sick big appetite with a weak stomach
Aint had nowhere to go nigga I was lost in them streets runnin
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it nigga nobody ever gave me nothin
Flexin so hard I might pull a muscle but I just keep stuntin
Thirty in the mag you get bodybagged Im just gon keep dumpin
Police get behind me Ima press the gas Im just gon keep stompin
Im just gon keep stompin

Plottin on the comeup we was schemin
Now I hit the stage and they screamin
I was tryna cope through them hard times
For them X pills I was fiendin
Got a bad bitch honey skintone pretty long hair she Belizean
Tryna tell you girl I cant love you Im a coldhearted lil demon
Dysfunctional I cant show affection might bug out for no reason
Really you dont even gotta be here I done got so used to people leavin
You was ridin for me then you switched up now its fuck you and I mean it
Couple situations left me traumatized now I say less cause Im speechless
If my brother need it then I got him man the whole gang know how Im bleedin
Tryna wake up from them nightmares devil in my ear while Im dreamin
In my past life did some bad things I know karma tryna get even
Tryna get away from all the drama hopped in the Benz now Im speedin


Told em I was gonna be somethin
That broke shit made me sick big appetite with a weak stomach
Aint had nowhere to go nigga I was lost in them streets runnin
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it nigga nobody ever gave me nothin
Flexin so hard I might pull a muscle but I just keep stuntin
Thirty in the mag you get bodybagged Im just gon keep dumpin
Police get behind me Ima press the gas Im just gon keep stompin
Im just gon keep stompin


Goofy tried stealin my formula
Look these niggas corny these niggas cant come on my corner
Im the one do what I wanna
I made the guys spin that bitch every day like a carnival
Bought her a Patek Philippe cause she wanted one
These niggas nothin like me I am one of one
Take the Bentley four hundred I pay the bond
You aint scarin no one with no gun in this bitch
Everybody go dumb in this bitch
Niggas hoes and they mama a bitch
In the hood like Obama and shit
Presidential tint no tellin who in it
Ask around I bet they tell you we winnin
Different foreign cars aint none of em rented
Hundred million cash Im comin to get it
Out in Cali but my mind in the trenches
I advise the boy to play his position
Run it up and show love to my city
Never leave em Im bringin em with me
Keep a glizzy its goin in with me I cant let em get me
No time for bullshit Im sorry Im busy

Foenem line shit like a barber Glock knock off his facial hair
Caught him lackin in his whip they tryna find his face in there
Lil Hop Out he stay on go bitch all he know is green light

Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon meWell respected in this hiphop lil Polo be spittin facts
A lot of rappers doin way more stuntin than givin back
You aint my color then you dont know the struggle of livin black
Cops kill us and we protest what type of shit is that
Man if the police shoot at one of my brothers Im blickin back
We hate each other so we just wanna score and go titfortat
All these shorties want is points they aint chasin a different stat
Really riskin it all whats the point when that nigga rat
We seventeen got forty years in that court when we gettin cracked
Stuck in the system they just watchin us fail while they sittin back
The government cuttin checks but cant cut a nigga some slack
Its hard to get a job so we hustle and flip a pack
Its all a setup no wonder why they call this bitch a trap
Life was messed up a matter of time til that nigga snap
Posttraumatic stress so them triggers keep gettin tapped
RIP Malcolm I promise to conquer and fill them gaps
Them corners leave a nigga boxed in tryna break free
Crazy how I love the same block that tried to break me
Pray that I aint in my own hood when they take me
This all we know a life of peace what we cant see
Im from where we unheard and we cant speak
We go to school they try to tell us what we cant be
Profit with a billiondollar mind like Im JAYZ
They killed Martin for dreamin and now I cant sleep
Why would the devil take my brother if he close to me
Now if you stare into my soul youll see my bros in me
We missin you man this aint how this shit supposed to be
Feel like Im stuck I wish them streets never proposed to me
Out there posted in the field with them soldiers deep
So now the other side wanna put a hole in me
Like every day might be the end of the road for me
We die young so I couldnt picture a older me
Fightin demons let them drugs take control of me
All in my head go and kill what they told to me
Member we aint have a thing same clothes for weeks
Hardbody thats how them situations molded me
Needed money and grew accustomed to this fast life
Pressure from this way of livin so we blast pipes
Shit got me stressin three hundred and sixtyfive nights
Them people workin against us like we dont have rights
It dont matter what this money and this fame can give
Ive been hurtin tryna smile through the pain and tears
Wish we could go back to them days when we played as kids
A lot of shit changed thats just the way it is

Thats just  Thats just the way it is 
Some thingsll never  Some thingsll never change 
Oh oh thats just the way it is  Way it is 
The way it is  Ooh 
Thats just  Thats just the way it is 
Some thingsll never  Some thingsll never change nonononono 
Yeah thats just the way it is  Way it is 
The way it is  Yeah 


Never never  Ayy 
Some things will never change  Some thingsll never change 
Never never  No thats just the way it is 
Some thingsll never change
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmm
You finally made it big brother
Youre the GOAT
D Major baby


Ive been scarred by your love left my heart bleedin
My soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons
Im on the Eway in a fast foreign car speedin
223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin
We aint never duckin beef bitch we not vegan
My lil niggas bout that action they be Glock squeezin
Red beams on his head now his top leakin
I heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin

I miss Mike Durb I wont forget the things you used to say
My friends got killed on the same block where we used to play
I know that death come unexpected you cant choose a day
I swear I pop so many pills shit got me losin weight
One minute life was so hard shit had me losin faith
I know my haters checkin on me I been doin great
I couldnt get wrapped up in that drama had to move away
Everything could change depend on what you do today
You gotta live with each decision that you choose to make
I used to hustle to survive I found a newer way
Remember high speeds in the hot car tryna lose the jakes
You got your life in your hands until you lose a case
So much potential in the lives these niggas threw away
Daydreamin bout my freedom every night I used to pray
I got that check and stayed loyal make sure my shooters straight
Heard he went unidentified them hollows chewed his face

Lil Duck hop out in traffic let them things bust
Lil Joe be buggin hell make you give your chain up
This shit too deep no I can never give my gang up
Shitll never be the same them trenches changed us
My niggas gone I miss them days when we came up
If I could be with you give all the money and the fame up
That pain was so unbearable I almost gave up
First we was broke but now Im swervin in that Range truck
We was wildin in them streets a savage what they named us
When its violence on our side of town they blame us
Smith  Wesson torch a nigga he get flamed up
Them 40 shells crack his head fuck your brain up

Smooth criminal Mike Jack
And I still like to tote a 45 like Mike back
Pull that TEC out just to make a statement
He gon need a body bag or a night sack
He a bitch hell fold under pressure
I can tell from his posture man he aint really like that
Mama told me I dont care if you scared
Go in for the kill if they try you better fight back
Well beat his ass if he try to throw the folks up
Whats all that shit you was sayin like you was so tough
They gon have to carry your mans if he approach us
Creepin in that glizzyll blam when we get close up
Richass gangster my gun match the color of my car
Any sudden movemnt and this bitch go Fah fah
Bet I have him huggin Allah
Im the GOAT Im a thug Im a star

Youngin tryna clar a crowd with the heat
When you ridin better keep a 40 cal by the seat
He was bangin wrong til they found him deceased
Its a whole lot of evil roamin round in the streets uh
So you better look both ways make your soul shake
Demons standin in the doorway
Tell me Annie are you okay Screamin out No way
Tell me Annie are you okay


Still on that bullshit MJ
Really one of the hottest and I never dropped a mixtape
All my life had to risktake
But if they come and try me 40 kickin til my wrist break
Let anybody in this bitch play
Ima have my Cs leave his ass in the ground with a stiff face
Where Im from all the killers turn hood legend
And they known through them blocks like Dikembe
Totin on something bigger than The Great Khali
Thirty shotsll knock him down like Muhammad Ali
Do the race scratch off in a Trackhawk Jeep
Catch him lackin then its RIP bitch
