Go Stupid Lyrics
Ayy
Gang gang gang ayy  Mike WiLL MadeIt 
Lil Capalot bitch hah
 Tay Keith fuck these niggas up 


Hit the strip after school couldnt wait til I got out of class used to stare at the clock and shit
Before all of this rappin shit I was gangbangin and doin highspeeds on the cops and shit
And Im straight from the Chi but I ball like a king up in Cali and shoot like Stojakovi
Keep applyin that pressure I go on the run it aint no lettin it up aint no stoppin this
Had to tell my lil brother to chill gotta stay in the house come outside he be poppin shit
You aint heard about us well you need to go watch the news niggas know we be dropping shit
Got the feds on my ass in the hood cause they think Im the one who been buyin up Glocks and shit
Im just focused on music they say my last tape was a classic but I got some hotter shit  Hotter shit 
Might be rocking a show or if Im not up the stu then Im fucking this cash off
Dont you know Polo G Skinny tall with the dreads that lil nigga be rappin his ass off
Yeah I heard she got surgery still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft
Go like Harden with rockets we blast off
Tried to throw us some bullets but we made em fumble like nah you aint gettin that pass off
Spin the block now Im takin my mask off
Hit the gas like we racin speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt
Its gon be RIP once your ass caught
He like frontin we knockin his cap off
Nother day a new chain or a MAC bought
All this ice got me freezin like Jack Frost  4X 

That boy a bitch thats his dad fault
If you play then you lay we can crash out  Lets go 
When I up in his shit bet its man down  Boom 
In BOA Im pullin them bands out  Cash 
DOA bitch I get your mans off  Gone 
A rockstar from the block I stand out  Uh 
Came from nothing I fucked my advance off
When I hit the game with my flow niggas ran off  No cap  fuck it
Im not your average joe  Uhuh 
When I leave the house I tuck it uh  Fire fire 
Im rich I dont shop on no budget
He clutchin my lil youngin want him a bucket uh  Score 
I hop on this bitch and run it  Uh 
If I said it I seen it or done it  Uh uh 
These lil niggas never robbed nobody
Aint caught no body and aint getting no money  Cap 
Where Im from its sports or gunplay
We looked up to the killer and dealers
But even them niggas wan make it out one day  On gang 
Fuck my first M I been had hood fame  Yeah 
Took off like I was on a runway  Yoom 
Im a star but still post on the one way  Blatt 
Them niggas talk but they wont play  NLE 
We let them guns sing like the choir on Sunday  Yeah yeah 


Hop on the scene and Im thuggin
This Glock on my hip so you know that Im clutchin
Catch me an opp Ima down him in public
The police keep askin Im changin the subject
The way I grew up man a nigga was rugged
Why the fuck you got a gun You not gonna bust it
And a hundred some shots I aint doin no tustlin
Give a nigga temptation like he David Ruffin
I aint gon cap I dont even like rappin
But I love wrappin them bodies and shit
Fuck the bitch and when I get done
Ima up my Glock and then rob the bitch
Catch a nigga when he clock out
Ima get him whacked at his job and shit
And I dont know why the police keep fuckin with me
Cause they aint stoppin shit yeah
Spin on your block like a remix
Shoot him in the face get his teeth lit
Extended clip like a broomstick
Shoot a flick like Netflix
Scratch an opp off the checklist
I just bought a gun off Craigslist
Shoot an opp in the brain Im leavin a stain only thing you see is red shit
If the police behind we keep duckin
My gun need some drawers it got nuts
Whole gang we strapped dont test us
If a nigga play he gon get bust yeah
NLE the Top Shotta don dada
Got the bombs like AlQaeda
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
