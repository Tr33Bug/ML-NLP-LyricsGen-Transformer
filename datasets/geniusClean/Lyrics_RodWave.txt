Heart On Ice Lyrics
SpeakerBangerz
Look uh look


Heart been broke so many times I dont know what to believe
Mama say its my fault its my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think its best I put my heart on ice heart on ice cause I cant breathe
Ima put my heart on ice heart on ice its gettin the best of me


While in the cell with Lil Hakeem after I slapped him I had told him
I dont know how you get down with them clowns but Im a soldier
No one could understand I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to backstabbed and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin one day Id find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch starin at the ceiling
Tryin not to get in my feelings
Thinkin of a way I could make these millions
Maybe thatll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days yeah

Heart been broke so many times I dont know what to believe
Mama say its my fault its my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think its best I put my heart on ice heart on ice cause I cant breathe
Ima put my heart on ice heart on ice its gettin the best of me

I kinda just called to hear your voice so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh I should hang up what am I doing Um
So uh I feel kinda dumb but uh
I miss you Ive been thinking about you
Ive been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that youre doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because I miss you and I just thought of you so I thought Id call you
To tell you that you crossed my mind and I took that as a sign that I should call and say hi
So thats all hi
I hope you dont think Ive lost my mind I hope you dont think Im crazy
This message is getting long so I should just say bye but
The idea of you listening to this the thought of you on the other side of the line
I cant hang up
Im in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higherStarted the tour out in Denver Colorado
I made the first one but I did not make the second show

Its safe to say I been this way since I was eighteen
The same night I fall in love I feel it fading
Who can you love who can you trust now that youre mainstream
Dont want no love dont got no trust I feel me changin  Yeah 
Sometimes I think about my high school sweetheart  Ohohoh 
But times change people change and grow apart
I fell so hard and fast for Dee I wanna start a family  Family 
She show resentment she got pregnant and she felt abandoned  Ohohoh 
That shit with whatshernam was faster than I had planned it  Ohohoh 
She movd away from San Diego livin in Miami  Miami 
We caught a flight to Puerto Rico she was sweet as candy  Candy 
She just aint know she had my heart before the plane landed  Yeah 
And by the time I got home  Ohohoh  I just wanted to be alone
I met Brianna through Kearra they were the best of friends  Oh ohohoh 
She turned her head and we moved up just like the Jeffersons  Yeah 

I need your all each and every day  Oh  if I cant then Ill fade
And I dont mean to rush but I easily fall in love  Yeah 
Uh in my head I know that that aint right

We can fall in love right here tonight
Run away and be together for life

No more Decembers lonely cold Decembers  Yeah 
Cold Decembers  Yeah  lonely cold Decembers yeah


Mmm  Grrah  yeah
Uh uhuh yeah

But I ODd in Denver and I just cant remember her name
I guess you could say that my love life was not up to par
Too many nights alone had left some permanent scars
She told me shed love me and I told her that Id do the same
Then I ODd in Denver and I just cant remember her name
Then I ODd in Denver and I just cant remember her name
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldnt complain
Doc said Son you cant do anymore of that cocaine
Your eyes staring back at me  Back at me 
My heart starts to skip a beat
I pray that you will never know  Never know 
I fall and then you look in my eyes
 Pipe that shit up TnT

Heart been broke so many times and I cant take it back
Ive been so scared of love got commitment issues
But somehow some way I fell in love with you
But how would you feel if I told you that I think you the one
How would you feel if I told you that I cant get enough
How would you feel if I told you that girl I need your love
How would you feel How would you feel

How would you feel if I told you that girl I need your love
How would you feel if I told you that girl I need your touch
Could you feel me if I told you that its hard to trust
I been hurt before I done heard these words before
I done took lies straight to the face been stabbed in my back
I done been crossed by my closest people cant blame you for that
Last bitch told me that she love me couldnt stand on that
Told me that she would never leave me then her bags was packed
So I guess you can take that story say Im traumatized
They say I look just like my dad with my mamas eyes
They say our futures like my father with my mamas pride
Cause if I ever kiss that Cupid its a homicide
I was tryna lock up my heart and throw away the key
But somehow you made the key take control of me
I told myself never again would I ever fall
But when I see those pretty eyes I wanna risk it all


I fell straight on my face Ill take the blame for that
Heart been broke so many times and I cant take it back
Ive been so scared of love got commitment issues
But somehow some way I fell in love with you

To whom it may concern or dear future owner
I have this heart but I cant control it
It loves what it loves it does what it wanna
Tried to lock it up but it jumped back on my shoulder
Dont get me wrong its a good heart and its golden
But its been stolen on top of that its been broken
Drug through the mud its driving me insane
Tryna spread love pickin fights with my brain
Dont want it literally so over it mentally
So tired physically it distracts and hinders me
So its for sale the best offer gets the box
Gift from my mother but a curse from my pops
Kinda hurts when it locks but Ill get better
Right now Im tryna focus on putting it back together
After Im done you can come pick it up whenever
So I can focus on gettin back to the cheddar I swear its

Its always in the wrong hands
I dont think Ill use it again
I would do the faith thing and give it a try
But if it stay itll take over my mind
Ive got a heart for sale I dont need it
Ive got a heart for sale and its bleeding
Ive got a heart for sale you can keep it
Ive got a heart for sale
Its always in the wrong hands
I dont think Ill use it again
I would do the faith thing and give it a try
But if it stay itll take over my mind
Ive got a heart for sale I dont need it
Ive got a heart for sale and its bleeding
Ive got a heart for sale you can keep it
Ive got a heart for sale yeah yeah
