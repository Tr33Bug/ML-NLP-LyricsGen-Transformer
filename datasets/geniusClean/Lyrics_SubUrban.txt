TranslationsCradles Lyrics
I live inside my own world of makebelieve
Kids screaming in their cradles profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep


I love everything
Fires spreading all around my room
My worlds so bright
Its hard to breathe but thats alright
Hush
Shh

Tape my eyes open to force reality  Oh no no 
Why cant you just let me eat my weight in glee
I live inside my own world of makebelieve
Kids screaming in their cradles profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I cant tell if my body belongs to me


I love everything
Fires spreading all around my room
My worlds so bright
Its hard to breathe but thats alright
Hush
Shh


I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a oneway gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
Its music til the wick burns out
Hush


Just wanna be care free lately yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count em like the fourleaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheepWelcome to our freak show come meet my monsters
Oh such a fine collection of stranger things


My patience running thinner on this melting clock
Cerebrum jailed with thoughts most would consider rot
To think youre any different from an animal
A creature sick as you should be put down
But I cant help myself

Oohnananana oohnananana
Oohnananana oohnananana


Welcome to our freak show come meet my monsters
 Oohnananana oohnananana 
Oh such a fine collection of stranger things
 Oohnananana oohnananana 


Please dont hide your imperfections
Nature took two tries to make the man in white
No I dont mind you are a beauty
Not temptation youre my creation


Freak o Friday night know Im the main attraction
Basket acrobat they wanna see some action
Tinkering with my design twist and tame my feral mind
Play with me til youve found another toy
Let me be your freak show I could be your favorite monster
Rattle my whole cage remind me why I cant be fostered
Let me be your freak show I could be your favorite monster
Lock me up dont let me out cause you know I cant help myself


Oohnananana oohnananana
Oohnananana oohnananana


Welcome to our freak show come meet my monsters
 Oohnananana oohnananana 
Oh such a fine collection of stranger things
 Oohnananana oohnananana 


Youre wasting youre wasting all
Of your time finding a cure when theres no disease
Youre wasting youre wasting all
Of your talent on an audience that sees a freak


Oohnananana oohnananana
Oohnananana
Cant help myself


Welcome to our freak show come meet my monsters
 Oohnananana oohnananana 
Oh such a fine collection of stranger things
 Oohnananana oohnananana Tell me is your father a good man
Its surprising how little he seems to understand
His daughter was my savior
Sure she can be a little indecisive
But I dont have to make her choose cause


This is how it goes
Watching it unfold  Watching it unfold 
Playing my own role  Runaway on em 
Dumdumdittydumdumditty daddy dont
Make me leave this home
This is what you chose  This is what you chose 
I cant let him go  Runaway on em 
Dumdumdittydumdumditty daddy dont

In our house the quiet is so loud
Ill never hear a single word you wanna shout ah
Oh God youre just a child
Oh he can be a little too invasive
And I just want to live


This is how it goes
Watching it unfold  Watching it unfold 
Playing my own role
Dumdumdittydumdumditty daddy dont
Make me leave this home
This is what you chose
I cant let him go  Runaway on em 
Dumdumdittydumdumditty daddy dont


Tell me is your father a good man
Its surprising how little he seems to understand
His daughter was my savior
Sure she can be a little indecisive
But I dont have to make her choose cause


This is how it goes
Watching it unfold  Watching it unfold 
Playing my own role  Runaway on em 
Dumdumdittydumdumditty Daddy dont
Make me leave this home
This is what you chose  This is what you chose 
I cant let him go  Runaway on em 
Dumdumdittydumdumditty daddy


Ooh ooh oohSunny kinda funny yeah


Im not what I want to see
Juggling insecurities
Locked inside my cage of shit
No I dont want to be clean I dont want to be seen
Im just waiting for someone to put me to sleep
Like Im

I live such a lonely life
I dont like to go outside
Please please fucking leave me be
No I dont want dirty hands I dont want to be mean
But Im sick of meeting new people on my scene
Like Im aggravated motivated never gonna graduate
Im stimulated overstated I just wanna get sedated
On the contrary I just wanna meet a nice girl
Messy not too sketchy keep me tied up in the right world
Segregated situated hangin on sophisticated
Liberated nauseated I just want more medication
Individuality and blue light gives me headaches
Not changing for the better Im just changing clothes on weekends




Weathers nice outside I think Ill close the window blinds
Yeah sleep through my alarm so that I skip the sunny part
Uh Im not one to take a risk Ill suck your blood no anemics
Garlic or sticks Im vampiric I just dont like the sun
Hear her talkin bout that mainstream
Got it real easy like she got the callback
Droppin underneath that eave breeze
Wanna watch her knees weak
When they pass my name back
You know you sound cocky as fuck
But go and try good fuckin luck
So if you ask to come and see me
Show some fuckin dignity
Dont tell me how to live life

And I make it go  Boom  back at it again
Dont need to be in love to have a little romance
Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance
And even if theyre petrified I hear their hearts prance
And I can be free from raw tyranny
Man fuck my emotions theyre ghostin and moanin all day on repeat
 Woo 




 Uh 
We can fall in love or we can go insane
We can play it rough or we can we can play it safe
Dont matter whats above our destinies are made
Why give us fuckin lemons if I can just buy lemonade


And I make it go  Boom  back at it again
Dont need to be in love to have a little romance
Sing it on the spot to watch the crowd dance
And even if theyre petrified I hear their hearts prance
And I can be free from raw tyranny
Man fuck my emotions theyre ghostin and moanin all day on repeat


 Round and around we go 
 Round and around we go The fuck did you just say to me you little bitch
 I was a goddamn mistake that subsequently justified my fucking existence   Disinterested 


I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself
Its all I hear right now its all I hear right now
I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself
Its all I hear right now its all I hear right now
I wanna break my vows wanna neglect my health
How can I trust people if I cant trust myself
I wanna scream and shout I wanna cry and pout
But I cant make myself why cant I make myself

I always seem to make the same mistakes
The kinds you cant go back to fix that start to weigh
Until Im dragging round a body made of clay
Im just dead weight Im just dead weight
I wanna feel it all again and have somebody hold me in place
Tell it to my bruised face that I tried
But it was juvenile to think that I ever had a good thing
Going with a good being


So Ill go fuck myself til Im too lonely to feel
Dance like a court jester just for a film with no reel
And Ill lose all of my friends when Im no longer ideal
And then get scolded again just to come home to no meal
I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself
Its all I hear right now its all I hear right now
I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself
Its all I hear right now its all I hear right now


I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself
Its all I hear right now its all I hear right now
I wanna kill myself I wanna kill myself
Its all I hear right now its all I hear right now
I wanna break my vows wanna neglect my health
How can I trust people if I cant trust myself
I wanna scream and shout I wanna cry and pout
But I cant make myself why cant I make myself
Wish I didnt know you as a dumb kid
Wish you were just another pretty girl to pick
God the times made us strangers yeah they did
You dont even know Im here but Im still there for you like years ago
Watching you grow up on the wrong fence side
Kid best friends but now you have an appetite
Just because youre made of different parts were damned
To fall in love its his plan but Im still there for you


But you dont care if I stare you wanna lay with me bare
You wanna play with my hair but you cant stay with me here
But you dont care if I stare you wanna lay with me bare
You wanna play with my hair but you cant stay with me here

You say youre confused you say youre gay  You say youre gay 
You say youre whatever you wanna be
You say youre confused you say youre gay  You say youre gay 
You say youre whatever you wanna be what do you wanna be
Youll never talk to me I still want company
What do you want from me You say it constantly
That youre in love with me but we dont touch
I think you only see the friend in me


But you dont care if I stare you wanna lay with me bare
You wanna play with my hair but you cant stay with me here
But you dont care if I stare you wanna lay with me bare
You wanna play with my hair but you cant stay with me here


You wanna do things that youve never done before
Youre just acting like a whore not allowed to lock your door
Wanna reciprocate but Im walkin on a wire
I just wanna see you smile but you got me so damn tired
Im just gonna wait for you to get your fuckin act up
Makin all this trash up just to blow a monthdue date yeah
And Im feelin like were cracked now Im never going back
No were only gonna end with hate


Wish I didnt know you as a dumb kid
Wish you were just another pretty girl to pick
God the times made us strangers yeah they did
You dont even know Im here but Im still there for you like years ago
Watching you grow up on the wrong fence side
Kid best friends but now you have an appetite
Just because youre made of different parts were damned
To fall in love its his plan but Im still there for you


But you dont care if I stare you wanna lay with me bare
You wanna play with my hair but you cant stay with me here

You wanna play with my hair but you cant stay with me hereMmhmmmm mmhmmmm
Uhoh


Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh you made a mistake
Uhoh uhoh
Tell me things that cant be true


Your slacks are on fire Im fanning the flames
Like a vampire stood out in broad day
Shouldve been wiser while pickin out
What you were gonna say oh

Fool me once thats one too many
Better luck next time youve met me
Wheres the dunce who caught you meddling
Turn around  Uhoh 


Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh you made a mistake  Haha haha 
Uhoh uhoh
Tell me things that cant be true


Youre sweating this time Im reading your eyes
Youre being called out cause you slipped your mouth
Your face has turned pale gon faint youre not well
While you were distracted I cast a spell  Hahahaha 


Uhoh you better run away now  Right now 
Uhoh youve made a mistake aw  Right now 
Uhoh got nothin else to say to you
 Uhoh 


Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh you made a mistake
Uhoh uhoh
Tell me things that cant be true


Forgive this wed intermission
Tragically Im not the victim here
If only I fell for your fiction
Tell me things that cant be trueI see the slashes on your legs
And the smile on your face again
Blood is drying on your fingernails
Laughing at something that I said
Were you still sitting hind the stairs
With the new boy in your hair when I left
You seem to recognize my face
But my hands feel like somebody elses


I blanked last night when you told me
I blanked last night when you told me twice
I blanked last night when you told me
I blanked last night when you told me twice

You cut your hair off with a blade
Didnt want a single trace that poor girl
The water couldnt get you clean
So you burned your skin instead with the curl  You live in your hell 
I watched an angel cut the sky
Feathers plucked from flight  Just to torture yourself 
And she sunk right through the ground
From colossal heights  Tell me what could I do 
When she cried out for my name
I didnt hesitate  The moment when the flies fell 
I screamed I cannot be your saint
I know you cant be saved


I blanked last night when you told me
I blanked last night when you told me twice
I blanked last night when you told me
I blanked last night when you told me twi
I blanked last night when you told me
I blanked last night when you told me twice
I blanked last night when you told me
I blanked last night when you told me twice
Clichs everywhere
But we dont care
But we dont care at all no
Youre getting stale youre blue
But you cant spare
But you cant spare the trouble


Dysfunctional family you live in the suburbs
One child no siblings you have a strict mother
You want a new face
You want a new face ohoh
Youre constantly bored and alone no new friends
You cant think youre depressed but you cant find the meanings
Its not just a phase
Its the lifestyle just wave ohoh

Clichs everywhere
But we dont care
But we dont care at all no
Youre getting stale youre blue
But you cant spare
But you cant spare the trouble


You buy roses on your first date
You wanna make her laugh just to soften her face
She doesnt really talk much compliment her good looks
Next you know youre fuckin on the couch no foreplay
Youre fucking clich you had a bad day
You walk home in the rain and feel emotionally drained
You wanna feel the cold tide mix it with some red wine
Waiting for a call back from the maginary friend line
Yeah


Clichs everywhere
But we dont care
But we dont care at all no
Youre getting stale youre blue
But you cant spare
But you cant spare the trouble


We like long walks on the beach
And sand beneath our feet  Ohoh 
Got a damsel in distress
And a hero to make the leap  Ohoh 
Love triangle at its best
Case of mistaken identity  Ohoh 
You think youre all original  Ohoh 
But youll never be unique


Clichs everywhere
But we dont care
But we dont care at all no
Youre getting stale youre blue
But you cant spare
But you cant spare the troubleI make more
Mama told you to hate the rich man when youre poor make more
Cause one day finally I realized theres no encore
I dont know if anybody is whole the moments gone
Theres no paradise just whimsical woes and charlatans


Chase that bag then  Dig your hole 
Realize theres no miracles
Just luck and sex and made up goals
I make more but  Im a poor soul 

You dont know what you know or what you dont
Guess thats the charm
Curiosity makes all the more dough
Just throw the dart  Oh 


Chase that bag then  Dig your hole 
Realize theres no miracles
Just luck and sex and made up goals
I make more but  Im a poor soul 


Ooh yeah lets eat the rich
Lets eat the rich
Ooh yeah lets eat the rich
I heard they taste like chocolate
Ooh yeah lets eat the rich
Lets eat the rich
Ooh yeah lets eat the rich
I heard they taste like chocolate


Chase that bag then  Dig your hole 
Realize theres no miracles
Just luck and sex and made up goals
I make more but  Im a poor soul

Hear the sirens songs reeling me to shallow watrs
Charlemagne

Preachers cherrypick gossip like violets
Vilify stars like a nihilist
Cannot win them all  They might just 
Mistake jealousy for judging ones taste
Praising sarcophagus arts sake
Diamond in the rough


Juggernaut faces wilt and decay
I know by and by Ill be replaced
But before I reach that event in time
Ill rearrange your



Common sense dont
Apprehend those that make everything about their lives
And Ill bet if you met me youd regret me
Because Im probably not on your side
Dont think about it youre making a change
The worlds a better
And if your talent consists of doreis
Id ask you kindly

I dont wanna have selfcontrol
I would rather feel something new than not feel at all
I dont think that I could recall
Was I always this tired Has my high expired Oh
I dont wanna have selfcontrol
III dont wanna have selfcontr
Wanna drown my life out without noises
Bottled poisons and flicker in my ears
Now all I hear are voices such hopeless voices
That I cant stay here for long
Or just die while Im young
Like a stranger that crashes and burns
Ill just bite on this gun
Ill just lean on this thumb
Ill just hurt until I cant hurt no more

Shittalk people staring at my dunce cap
Choirs singing nothing but the greenest trap
Who says that I gotta wear a suit tie
Who says that I gotta have an alibi


Please help me God just wants to paint me blue
No love just silhouettes who dont come through
Faint talent disappointing everyone
When rain clouds are more present then I gotta sing




Paint the thoughts onto my head day and night
If Ive made the wrong choices all of my life
Scribbling nonsenses on my walls
Living in fear of falling too far but
I cant stay behind bars


Wanna drown my life out without noises
Bottled poisons and flicker in my ears
Now all I hear are voices such hopeless voices
That I cant stay here for long
Or just die while Im young
Like a stranger that crashes and burns
Ill just bite on this gun
Ill just lean on this thumb
Ill just hurt until I cant hurt no more


 La la la la la 
Shittalk people staring at my dunce cap
Choirs singing nothing but the greenest trap
Who says that I gotta wear a suit tie
Who says that I gotta have an alibi


Rain down wasnt showing anyway
Clock broke I cant tell the night from day
Past gone living like Im living large
Make a toast to the slow lane



Forward
Im falling forward
Im dragging her words
Im falling forward
And I must start there


Youre wasting all of your time with those bad thoughts
Fall apart sick gonna be in the cobwebs
Leave your past the pass we met yeah
Sitting in the hallway screaming in the hallway

Youre gorgeous go and sing it now
We gon finally back down

Youre wasting all your damn time young sentimental
Erasing all the whole night
Youre some type youre chasing whole the emotions

Youre wasting all your damn time young sentimental
Erasing all the whole night
