Whoaoh whoaoh oh oh
Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you
It isnt easy to explain
And though Im really trying
I think I may start crying
My heart cant wait another day
When you kiss me Ive just got to say


 Baby I love you 
Come on baby
 Baby I love you 
Oohee baby
Baby I love only you
Whoaoh whoaoh oh oh

I cant live without you

I love to hear you call my name
Oh tell me that you feel the same


 Baby I love you 
Come on baby

Whoaoh whoaoh oh oh
I want him and I need him
And someday some way woah oh oh Ill meet him
Hell be kind of shy real good lookin too
And Ill be certain hes my guy by the things hell like to do


Like walking in the rain  like walking in the rain 
And wishing on the stars  and wishing on the stars  up above
And being so in love

When hes near me Ill kiss him
And when he leaves me woah oh oh Ill miss him
Though sometimes well fight I wont really care
And Ill know its gonna be alright cause weve got so much we share


Like walking in the rain  like walking in the rain 
And wishing on the stars  and wishing on the stars  up above
And being so in love


 Johnny  No no hell never do
 Bobby  No it isnt him too

Walking in the rain  like walking in the rain 
And wishing on the stars  and wishing on the stars  up above
And being so in love


Oh oh
Where can he be
Oh oh
Ive been wishing hopin that hell come to me
Was a happy jolly soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

 Frosty the snowman 
 Frosty the snowman 

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler Stop

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying Dont you cry
Ill be back again some day

 Frosty the snowman  Ohhohh
 Frosty the snowman  Ohhohh
 Frosty the snowman  Oh
 Frosty the snowman  Ohoh
 Frosty the snowman  Ohh ohoh
 Frosty the snowman  Oh yeah
 Frosty the snowman  Dont cry ohohh
 Frosty the snowman  Oh yeah
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didnt see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peek
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep

Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Oh what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night
 I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus

Fell in love but now weve parted
Couldnt see the writing on the wall
Here I sit my head in hand
Trying hard to understand
Pity me I used to have it all

Since he left my nights are long
And everything I do is wrong
And when they play our favorite song
Too late hes gone too late hes gone
Woahoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 
Woahohohohohoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 
Woahoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 
Woahohohohohoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 

Here I sit brokenhearted
It was through before we started
I didnt know that it was our last call
Here I sit my head in hand
Trying hard to understand
Oh too bad for now the tears must fall

Since he left its just no good
And I cant do the things I should
And now I cry I knew I would
Too late hes gone too late hes gone

Woahoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 
Woahohohohohoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 
Woahoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 
Woahohohohohoh  RonRonRonnie wont you runrun girl 

Here I sit brokenhearted
Dont you know Im brokenhearted
I feel Im brokenhearted
Ooee Im brokenhearted
Cant you hear me Im brokenhearted
And flowers grow forever more
Where time is standing still
And lovers fill the quiet places by the shore
We will cross a rainbow to a place where well be free
Where hell give his love to me
So Ill wait for the day when he takes me away to
Paradise hell take me by the hand to
Paradise well walk along the sand in
Paradise a nevernever land
Paradise whooo
Well build a castle there so we can share
The happiness weve waited for
Where white flamingos fly way up high
Way above the oceans roar

We will climb a mountain to see our wonderland
Maybe now youll understand
Why I wait for the day when hell take me away to
Paradise hell take me by the hand to
Paradise well walk along the sand in
Paradise a nevernever land
Paradise whooo

Ill stand by him do right by him
And I swear that I would die for him die for him
Paradise hell take me by the hand to
Paradise well walk along the sand in
Paradise whoooo paradise
Baby do you know what you took away
You took the blue out of the sky
My whole life changed when you said goodbye
And I keep cryin cryin
Oh baby Oh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
Cause if I never saw the sunshine baby
Maybe I wouldnt mind the rain
Every day is just like the day before
All alone a hundred miles from shore
All of my dreams I dreamed with you
Now they will die and never come true
And so Im cryin cryin
Oh baby Oh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
Cause if I never saw the sunshine baby
Maybe I wouldnt mind the rain
There wouldnt be this pain
And I know there wouldnt be cloud thats over me
Everywhere I go
Oh baby Oh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
Cause if I never saw the sunshine baby
Maybe I wouldnt mind the rain
I wouldnt mind the rain Oh that pain
Oh that rain that sunshine
