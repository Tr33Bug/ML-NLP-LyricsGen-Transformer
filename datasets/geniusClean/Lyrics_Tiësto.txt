Back and forth back and forth with the bullshit
I know I said it before I dont mean it
Its been a while since I had your attention
So it might hurt to hear this
Ooh yeah yeah 
Dreams we have dont ever fall away
We cant live em if we stay the same
And I cant do this for another day
So lets get down lets get down to business

Weve had a million million nights just like this
So lets get down lets get down to business yeah
Ooh yeah yeahI like us better when were wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when were wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then Ill lay in it instead
I like us better when were wasted
Oh woah woah woah woah
You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night
I like us better when were wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then Ill lay in it instead
I like us better when were wasted
Oh woah woah woah woah
You are a catch22 either way I miss out
All of the grief I give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night
I like us better when were wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then Ill lay in it instead
I like us better when were wasted
Oh woah woah woah woah
I like us better when were wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then Ill lay in it instead
I like us better when were wasted
Oh woah woah woah woah
Oh woah woah woah woahBlacked out
Everything faded on your love
Im already wasted so close
That I can taste it now now
So lets break right out of these gilded cages
Were going to make it now
Dont ever turn around
Dont ever turn around
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There aint no reason to stay
Well be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
White lights flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs something we cant ignore
We cant back down
Well never let them change us
Were going to make it now
What are we waiting for
What are we waiting for
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There aint no reason to stay
Well be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
Everybody needs a little room to make mistakes
You dont have to be so perfect you can go at your own pace
Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I wont let you down
Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I wont let you down
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When youre tired and youre weary
And you have no strength to go on
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When theres no one to turn to
And all youve had faith in is gone
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
Everyone deserves a little precious time
To stumble till they find a little peace of mind
Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I wont let you down
Just show me the real you so that I can feel you
I promise I wont let you down
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When youre tired and youre weary
And you have no strength to go on
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When theres no one to turn to
And all youve had faith in is gone
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
Let me carry you home
When theres no one to turn to
And all youve had faith in is gone
Let me carry you homeFeeling blue without you
Give me one more chance give me one more dance
Im feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Just feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance give me one more dance
Im feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
I dream that you wont forget me
Thats all I really ask of ya
Id love to talk if youd let me
Ill take you back to the start with me
I keep on dreaming I dont know why
I cant seem to let it go
But I keep on tripping on what we had
Its hard not to let you know
Im feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance give me one more dance
Im feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Im feeling blue without you
I dont know what I should doooo
Feeling so blue without you
We built our love on foundations
We built a house on the hill yeah
Our little rock of salvation
Oh my loves there still
Cause I keep on dreaming I dont know why
I cant seem to let it go
But I keep on tripping on what we had
Its hard not to let you know
Im feeling blue without you
Give me one more chance give me one more dance
Im feeling blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Im feeling blue yeah
Oh give me one more chance give me one more dance
Im blue without you
Tell me who am I to hold you down
Just feeling blue without youI aint no millionaire but Im on my way
Cant find love but hell Im on the way
When the world gets heavy you might hear me say
Im on my way on my way way
On my way on way way
Theres a little devil in us all
Swear everybody in this town just wants to see you fall
Baby its no fun so know its just a game yeah
Oh keep running outta love
And I dont go giving up
When Im running outta love love
No lets say Ive had enough
And I dont go giving up
I said it all before
I aint no millionaire but Im on my way
Cant find love but hell Im on the way
When the world gets heavy you might hear me say

When the world gets heavy you might hear me say
Im on my way on my way way
I aint no millionaire but Im on my way
Cant find love but hell Im on the way
When the world gets heavy you might hear me say
Im on my way on my way way
You can travel the world
But you cant run away
From the person you are in your heart
You can be who you want to be
Make us believe in you
Keep all your light in the dark
If youre searching for truth
You must look in the mirror
And make sense of what you can see
Just be
Just be
They say learning to love yourself
Is the first step
That you take when you want to be real
And flying on planes to exotic locations
Wont teach you
How you really feel
Face up to the fact
That you are who you are
And nothing can change that belief
Just be
Just be
Cause now I know
Its not so far
To where I go
The hardest part
Is inside me
I need
To just be
Just be
Just be
Just be
Just be
I was lost and
Im still lost but
I feel so much better
Cause now I know
Its not so far
To where I go
The hardest part
Is inside me
I need
To just be
Just beI see you in my head
You aint like the rest
You aint bringin me down baby
Youre right next to me
Were makin history
The suns about to go down baby
Oooooooooh

Impossible to take it too far
Summer nights gettin high like the first time
You and I make it last forever
Summer nights gettin high like the first time
You and I make it last forever

You and I make it last forever
Summer nights gettin high like the first time

Makin lust forever baby
Ooooooh yeah
Make it last foreverSometimes the bomb might explode without any warning
I wish I was more than a cloud in your universe
I wish there was room in the sky for the two of us
Cause when I hear you loud its a hell of a sound
Oh when I hear you loud its a hell of a sound
If you were here right now Id be telling you how
Well turn it all around
If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning
Our love would be rehearsed
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it
Would you love me till it hurts
And then maybe we could make it
You and I
If we were written in reverse ah 
Maybe we could make it
You and I
I wish we were still in New York on the avenue
Living in before we had known any other view
Cause when I hear you loud its a hell of a sound
Oh when I hear you loud its a hell of a sound
If you were here right now Id be telling you how
Well turn it all around
If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning
Our love would be rehearsed
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it
Would you love me till it hurts
And then maybe we could make it
You and I
If we were written in reverse ah 
Maybe we could make it
You and I
If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning  Was our beginning 
Our love would be rehearsed  Love would be rehearsed 
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it
Would you love me till it hurts
And then maybe we could make it
You and I
I didnt see it coming
Blow by blow
Sucker punch
Rushes in
Here to stay
Rushes in
You are here to stay
What rushes in to my heart and my skull
I cant control Think about it feel it in my bones
What rushes in to my heart and my skull
I cant control
I feel you in my bones
Youre knocking at my window
Youre slow to letting me go
I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
Left hook
I didnt see it coming
Left hook
Youve got dead aim
Rushes out
Run away
Rushes out
You always run away
What rushes in to my heart and my skull
I cant control Think about it feel it in my bones
What rushes in to my heart and my skull
I cant control
I feel you in my bones
Youre knocking at my window
Youre slow to letting me go
I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
I feel you in my bones
Youre knocking at my window
Youre slow to letting me go
I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
I feel it in my bones
At night my skull feels 
I feel it  in my bones 
I feel it in my skull
I feel you in my bones
Youre knocking at my window
Youre slow to letting me go
I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bones
I take a breath Take a breath
With me Blow by blow
Take a break Take a break
From me You are here to stay
I take my heart out of my chest
I just dont need it any more
Take my head out of the game
I just dont need it any more
Take a breath Take a breath
With me Blow by blow
Take a break Take a break
From me You are here to stay
I take my heart out of my chest
I just dont need it any more
Take my head out of the game

I feel you in my bones
Youre knocking at my window
Youre slow to letting me go
I know this feeling oh so
This feeling in my bonesI can feel this energy
Its racing through my bones
All we have is memories
That soon goes up in smoke
Faster than a bullet
Go ahead and pull it
Were unstoppable
I can feel this energy
Spacing through my bones
Faster than a bullet
Go ahead and pull it
Were unstoppable
I can feel this energy
Its racing through my bones
I can feel this energy
Its racing through my bones
All we have is memories
That soon goes up in smoke
Faster than a bullet
Go ahead and pull it
Were unstoppable
I can feel this energy
Its racing through my bones
I dont know what went wrong
If I did wouldnt matter cause
It just wasnt enough
You know when the moment comes
To be strong show resistance
And thats what were led to believe
When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here  I will be here 
You dont mind if lifes not that pretty
It will soon disappear
It will be miles away
Away from here
When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here  I will be here 
And when it all seems to fall apart
You cant breathe
You dont know what youre thinking
You need somewhere to start
I will be here  I will be here 
I will be here  I will be here 
I will be here  I will be here 
When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
And when it all seems to fall apart
You cant breathe
You dont know what youre thinking
You need somewhere to start
I will be here  I will be here 
When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here  I will be here What you have always been
Life figuring out
Peripheral vision
No words we can speak
Our paths have been chosen
But all the trails that we trek
Should lead us back to here
Because our
Love comes again
Just when Ive broken down I found
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when Ive broken down I found
Love can come again
Dig within me
Turn all the secret stones
Forests and fields
Breathing with blood and bones
Still no words we can speak
Our paths have been chosen
But all the trails that we trek
Should lead us back to here
Because our
Love comes again
Just when Ive broken down I found
Love can come again
You gotta believe that
Love comes again
Just when Ive broken down I found
Love can come again
I been hanging around for a minute
