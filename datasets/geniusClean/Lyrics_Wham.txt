Happy Christmas 
Ah ahah
Oohwoah
Ohoh
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away  You gave it away 
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special  Special 
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognise me
Well its been a year it doesnt surprise me
Happy Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool Ive been
But if you kissed me now I know youd fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away  You gave it away 
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special  Special 
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special  Special oh

Im hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oohooh
Now Ive found a real love youll never fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away  You gave it away 
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special  Special

But the very next day you gave it away  You gave me away 
This year to save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special  Special 
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  I gave you my heart 
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year

People sayin that youre no good for me
Saw your lover with another
And shes making a fool of you oh
If you love me baby youd deny it
But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me Im a baby and I dont understand
But you know that Ill forgive you
Just this once twice forever
Cause baby

Just as long as were together and you do
I dont want your freedom

Parttimelove just brings me down
I dont need your freedom
Girl all I want right now is you
Do do do
Whoa oh oh yeah
Do do do do do do

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I cant escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me Im a fool
To give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby
Someone says the same to you
But you know that Ill forgive you
Just this once twice forever
Cause baby
You could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as were together
And you do oh

I said Soul boy lets hit the town
I said Hey boy whats with the frown
But in return all you could say was
Hi George meet my fiancee
Young guns having some fun

No tears no fears what I want to be
One two take a look at you
Death by matrimony
Hey sucker
What the hells got into you 
Hey sucker
Now theres nothing you can do 
A married man youre out of your head
Sleepless nights on an HP bed

Looking back on the good old days

Young guns having some fun

Death by matrimonyIn unlit alleyways
By the church downtown
Where Sally prays
Come down sometime
Well share a rusty can of corn yeah
And listen to the radio
I love you I love you it says
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico
You cried but I dont know how
Ive heard it all before
There it goes again
The slamming of the door
Sometimes the river calls me
And at night it calls my name
Says Put your troubles down beside me
Things have always been the same
And rock n roll wont teach me
What the river said that night
I jumped into this beauty
And drifted out of sight
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico
Woo woo
Dear mommy dear daddy
You had plans for me oh yeah
I was your only son
And long before this baby boy
Could count to three
You knew just what he would become
Run along to school
No child of mine grows up a fool
Run along to school
When you tried to tell me what to do
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you
One thing that I know for sure
Bad boys stick together
Never sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo woo woo
Good guys they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Dear mommy dear daddy
Now Im 19 as you see
Im handsome tall and strong
So what the hell gives you the right
To look at me as if to say Hell what went wrong
Where were you last night
You look as if you had a fight
Where were you last night
Well I think that you may just be right
But dont try to keep me in tonight
Because Im big enough to break down the door
Bad boys stick together
Never sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo woo woo
Good guys they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Boys like you are bad through and through
Still girls like me
Always seem to be with you
We cant help but worry
Youre in such a hurry 
Mixing with the wrong boys
Playing with the wrong toys 
Easy girls  And late nights 
Cigarettes  And love bites 
Why do you have to be so cruel
Youre such a fool
Bad boys stick together
Never sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo woo woo
Good guys they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Bad boys stick together
Never sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo woo woo
Good guys they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Happy Christmas

Happy that was until I saw you
Heartbeat heartbeat

I watch you breathe I can not sleep

And hope the morning sun wont wake you too soon
For when you wake and look at me
You never know you just might see
Another boy who crept into your room
Take your time thats what you told me
Take your time
But I fell head first and I just dont know what to do
Nothing looks the same in the light
Only a fool like me would take to heart
The things you said you meant last night
Nothing looks the same in the light
Ill keep my feet firm on the ground
Nothing looks the same in the light
Theres a danger in a stranger
With a warm hand then a kiss so right
Nothing looks the same in the light
Its been a pleasure see you around
I watch the sun upon the sheets
I hear a car out on the street
And gently pull you close its over too soon
What can I do but wait and see
Hold on to you please stay with me
Where am I now your love or a fool
Please be kind
Dont change your mind
Because youre the first
And I want to stay here with you
Nothing looks the same in the light
Only a fool like me would take to heart
The things you said you meant last night
Nothing looks the same in the light
Ill keep my feet firm on the ground
Nothing looks the same in the light
Theres a danger in a stranger
With a warm hand then a kiss so right
Nothing looks the same in the light
Its been a pleasure see you around
Please be kind
Dont change your mind
Because youre the first
And I want to stay here with you
Nothing looks the same in the light
Only a fool like me would take to heart
The things you said you meant last night
Nothing looks the same in the light
Ill keep my feet firm on the ground
In the light 
Nothing looks the same in the light
Theres a danger in a stranger
With a warm hand then a kiss so right
Nothing looks the same in the light
Its been a pleasure see you around
In the light 
Nothing looks the same in the light
Only a fool like me would take to heart
The things you said you meant last night
In the light 
Nothing looks the same in the light
Ill keep my feet firm on the ground
In the light 
Nothing looks the same in the light
Theres a danger in a stranger
Foreign skies
Theyve blinded me to empty charms
I crossed the ocean
Fell into your arms
So sure so wrong
You sang me a simple tune
I took it for a song
Say goodbye
Dont tell me why you have to go
Loving you was as good as gold as good as gold
Id love to love you really love you but you see
Theres something you should know
I really didnt think youd go
Because today
I could have sworn I heard you say
I love you I want you I need to be with you
Today I saw something in your face
Stay here beside me I need your love to hide me
You lied and now youve gone away
And left me crying like a baby
Like a baby
You said that you loved me
I thought that it was true
You said that you needed me
And baby I believed that too
I thought that you were shy
But you put me straight with a wink of your eye
I shouldve known better I know
Put my hands in my pockets every time I see you cry
People think that youre just so sweet
But they dont know you quite like I do
I guess they think that Im a lucky guy
But youre not fooling everybody
You can have my credit card baby
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady
All I know is what I see
Youre getting what you want and girl it aint just me
No matter how you cry Im not giving any love away
Do you think Im crazy
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
Youre in love with me baby
Dont tell me you love me
Because I know that its not true
Just tell me you need my money
Girl you know Ill give it to you
Between the ocean and the sky
There are things that you cant buy
And if you look youll see one of them is me
Take you hands out of my pockets
Digging till the day you die
People think that youre just so sweet
But they dont know you quite like I do
I guess they think that Im a lucky guy
But youre not fooling anybody
You can have my credit card baby
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady
All I know is what I see
Youre getting what you want and girl it aint just me
No matter how you cry Im not giving any love away
Do you think Im crazy
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
Youre in love with me baby
They dont know you quite like I do
And youre not fooling anybody
You can have my credit card baby
But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady
All I know is what I see
Youre getting what you want and girl it aint just me
No matter how you cry Im not giving any love away
Do you think Im crazy
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
Youre in love with me
These are the things that youve made for yourself
Youve gotta take your opportunities or stay on the shelf
You wanna stay oh yeah
Well thats okay
Its just a game that we play
No matter how you cry Im not giving any love away
Do you think Im crazy
All I know is what I see
But what can I do when you pretend that
Youre in love with me
