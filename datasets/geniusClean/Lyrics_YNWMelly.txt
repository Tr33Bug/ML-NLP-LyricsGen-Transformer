TranslationsEspaolPortugusMurder on My Mind Lyrics
Get to roll no
Ayy Im in the studio bro
Oh nah yeah call me ball me
Yeah Ill bet
Yeah Im at the studio hold up though


I aint get to roll no weed I aint get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas aint get to see my niggas
Aint get to hug my mama couldnt even give her no kisses
Cant even post on my Instagram cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious might probably say that Im tripping
When Im all alone in my jail cell I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud dont pass me no midget
And Ima smoke all of my pain away cause thats the only thing that gon heal it
I dont understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me so I love em all from a distance
Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine cause every time

I wake up in the morning I got murder on my mind
AK47s MAC11 Glocks and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating tryna knock me off my grind
But I cant let em do it I got murder on my mind
Bitch I got murder on my mind  Bitch I got murder on my mind 
I got murder on my mind  On my mind 
I got murder on my mind  I got murder on my mind 
I got murder on my mind I got murder on my mind


Yellow tape around his body its a fucking homicide
His face is on a Tshirt and his family traumatized
I didnt even mean to shoot him he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol cocked it back and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him Its too late my friend its time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms blood all on my shirt


Wake up in the morning I got murder on my mind
AK47s MAC11 Glocks and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating tryna knock me off my grind
But I cant let em do it I got murder on my mind
Bitch I got murder on my mind  Bitch I got murder on my mind 
I got murder on my mind  On my mind 
I got murder on my mind
