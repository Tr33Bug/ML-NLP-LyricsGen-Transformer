War Machine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Push your foot to the floor
Don't need no more
You been kickin' around
While you're messin' about

[Pre-Chorus]
Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild
[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

[Verse 2]
Make a stand, show your hand
Call in a high command
Don't think, just obey
I'm like a bird of prey

[Pre-Chorus]
Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild

[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)

[Bridge]
Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck, know the score
They're taken by surprise
And here's mud in your eye
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Misery's the name if you shoot 'em for gain
Call of the wild
Hurry for naught
That thing gone wild

[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
Let's go

[Guitar Solo]

That thing gone wild

[Chorus]
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)
War machine (war machine)1Embed
