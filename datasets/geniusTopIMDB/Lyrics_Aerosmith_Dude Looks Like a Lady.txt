Dude (Looks Like a Lady) Lyrics[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse 1]
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away!
[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse 2]
Never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover?
Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus
Lord, imagine my surprise

[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Bridge]
So baby, let me follow you down (Let me take a peek, dear)
Baby, let me follow you down (Do me, do me, do me all night)
Baby, let me follow you down (Turn the other cheek, dear)
Baby, let me follow you down (Do me, do me, do me, do me)

[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Outro]
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
That, that...11Embed
