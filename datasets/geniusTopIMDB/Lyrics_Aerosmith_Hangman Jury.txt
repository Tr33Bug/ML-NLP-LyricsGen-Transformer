Hangman Jury Lyrics[Verse 1]
Me old my lady sitting in the shade
Talking about the money that I ain't made
Singing o boy don't you line the
Track a lack a

[Chorus 1]
O boy don't you line the track
O boy don't you line the track a lack a
O boy don't you line the track
[Chorus 2]
If I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock that Moses stood
Singing o boy don't you line the track a lack a

[Chorus 1]
O boy don't you line the track
O boy don't you line the track a lack a
O boy don't you line the track

[Verse 2]
Drank so much hooch
It made my eyes be getting blurry
They say I nailed her to the wall
A stitch in time don't mean a thing
No hangman jury could make me crawl
Cause I'm a poor boy

[Chorus 1]
O boy don't you line the track
O boy don't you line the track a lack a
O boy don't you line the track

[Verse 3]
What you do with the gun that's loaded
Shot her dead when your heart exploded
Tell me baby now d-dontcha worry
Like lyin' to the hangman jury
I swear I didn't know that .45 was loaded
In fact my memory ain't too clear
That's not to say she didn't get what she deserved
Least that's the way it look from here
Boy when you line the track a lack a
Hey boy don't you line the track
You might also like[Chorus 3]
Oh a love come tumblin' down
Oh a love come tumblin' down
Oh (Let's get outta here)
When a love come tumblin'

[Verse 4]
And every night she take her thing
Into the city and in the mornin' make me beg
Cause If I'd taken all her real titty gritty
I'd smack her right upside the head boy

[Chorus 1]
O boy don't you line the track
O boy don't you line the track a lack a
O boy don't you line the track

[Chorus 3]
Oh when love come tumblin' down
Oh when love come tumblin' down
Oh when love come tumblin'

[Verse 5]
Poor boy sweating in the hot summer night
Hangman waitin' for the early morning light
Singing hey boy don't you line the track a lack a
[Chorus 1]
O boy don't you line the track
O boy don't you line the track a lack a
O boy don't you line the track

[Chorus 2]
If I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock that Moses done stood
Singing o boy don't you line the track a lack a
O boy don't you line the track1Embed
