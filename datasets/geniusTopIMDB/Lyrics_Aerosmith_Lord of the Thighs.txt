Lord of the Thighs Lyrics[Verse 1]
Down to who knows who, just to socialize
I'm waiting for my girls, when you call my eyes (Ooh)
You got no way to make a man, honey
You got to understand
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs

[Verse 2]
Well, well, Lordie my God
What do we got here? (Haha)
She's flashing across the floor
Make it perfectly clear
You're the bait, and you're the hook
Someone 'bound to take a look
I'm your man, child, lord of the thighs
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You must have come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the lord of the thighs

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You must have come here to find it
You've got the look in your eyes
Although you really don't mind it
I am the lord of your thighsYou might also like2Embed
