Love in an Elevator Lyrics[Intro: Catherine Epps]
2nd floor. Hardware, children's wear, lady's lingerie
Oh, good morning Mr. Tyler, going....down?

[Stephen Tyler]
Heh heh heh
Oooo.....

[Verse 1]
Mmmm [repeat]
Yeah
Workin' like a dog for the boss man (Whoa)
Workin' for the company (Whoa, yeah)
Bettin' on the dice I'm tossin' (Whoa)
I'm gonna have a fantasy (Whoa, yeah)
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines
[Chorus]
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

[Verse 2]
Jackey's in the elevator (Whoa)
Lingerie second floor (Whoa, yeah)
She said, "Can I see you later (Whoa)
And love you just a little more?" (Whoa, yeah)
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said, "I'll show you how to fax
In the mail room, honey
And have you home by five"

[Chorus]
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
In the air, in the air
Honey, one more time now, it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down

[Bridge]
Love in an
Elevator
Going down
Haha-haha-haha-haha

[Chorus]
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I hit the ground

[Verse 3]
Gonna be a penthouse pauper (Whoa)
Gonna be a millionaire (Whoa, yeah)
Gonna be a real fast talker (Whoa)
And have me a love affair (Whoa, yeah)
Gotta get my timing right (Whoa)
It's a test that I got to pass (Whoa, yeah)
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway, honey (Whoa)
Kiss your sassafras

[Chorus]
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up 'til we hit the ground
Will you care, will you care
Honey, one more time now, it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Will you care, will you care
Honey, one more time now, it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
Honey, one one one one one one one
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
Honey, one one one one one one one
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
Honey, one one one one one one one
Love in an elevator
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air, in the air
In the air, in the air
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down3Embed
