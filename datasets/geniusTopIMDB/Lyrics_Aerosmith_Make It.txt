Make It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Good evening people, welcome to the show
Got something here I want you all to know
When life and people bring on primal screams
You got to think of
What it's going to take to make your dreams

[Chorus]
Make It
Don't break it
I said make It
Don't break it
If you do then you feel like the world's coming down on you
[Verse 2]
You know that history repeats itself
What you just done, so has somebody else
You know you do, you've got to think up fast
You've got to figure what it's going to take to make it last

[Chorus]
Make It
Don't break it
I said make It
Don't break it
If you do then you feel like the world's coming down on you

[Bridge]
Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catching the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
You're only paying your dues

[Verse 3]
Dues is the price that you gotta pay
And if you don't they'll get you anyway
Although you know what you've been going through
You're on the brink so think what it takes to...

Make It
Don't break it
I said make It
Don't break it
If you do then you feel like the world's coming down on you

[Outro]
Better weather, pull yourself together
Don't be catching the blues
Better weather, pull yourself together
What have you got to loseEmbed
