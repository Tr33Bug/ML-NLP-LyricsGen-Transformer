No More No More Lyrics[Verse 1]
Blood stains the ivories
Of my daddy's baby grand
I ain't seen no daylight
Since we started this band

[Chorus]
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 2]
Store bought clothes
Falling part at the seams
Tea leaf reading gypsies
Fortune telling my dreams
[Chorus]
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Bridge]
Holiday Inn, lock the door with a chain
You love it and you hate it
But to me they're all the same

[Chorus]
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Bridge]
Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage

[Verse 3]
Stalemate jailbait
Ladies can't refuse
You love them then you leave them
With your sold out reviews

[Chorus]
No more, no more
No more, no more
You might also like[Verse 4]
Sweet talking barroom, ladies' disease
Slipping with her lips
Sliding down your knees

[Chorus]
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Verse 5]
Lived my life a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby, I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I stop changing
I'll be writing out my will

[Bridge]
It's the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill
[Outro]
Babe I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage1Embed
