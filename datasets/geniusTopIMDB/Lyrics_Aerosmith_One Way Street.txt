One Way Street Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey look yonder
What's that I see
Well that old bogus honey
Coming after me
I thought you told her
I was out of town
I wonder how she know'd
I was hanging around
Say, listen baby
Don't go wasting your time
You keep a-comin' 'round
You'll hear the same old line
You got a thousand boys
You say you need 'em
You take what's good for you
And I'll take my freedom
[Chorus]
Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

[Verse 2]
I thought I knew her
My cagey lady
How could my sunshine
Be so damn shady
She'll say she loves to talk
A conversation
But I'm the one
Who makes my situation
It's one way city, mmh
And I thought I knew
It's such a pity, honey
I'm dancing for you

[Chorus]
Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

[Bridge]
(Ha ha ha, you know what I'm talking about baby)
(I've seen that butterfly you tattooed on your pants)
(I'm gonna ge' me some of that yeah-heh-heh!)

[Verse 3]
There's nothing over here
I never showed you
I made it pretty clear
I'm glad to know you
You know your brother Spike
He's on the level
But you always looking
Like you're mad at the devil
Don't say I copped a 'tude
It's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude
Your fruits are rotten
You know I work so hard to keep it alive
Now all I hear from you
Is nothing but jive

[Chorus]
Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)
Cause a-lately it's been so hard, now
To make ends meet, oh yes it has
And honey, oh hey it's a
One Way Street
And I'm going the other way
(heh, heh, heh)

[Outro]
You're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
I said, you're heading down a one way street
You're fooling everybody you meet
You got to get yourself back on your feet
Yeah baby

Oh baby
Lovin everybody yoo-hoo

Come at everybody
Chewin' everybody
Foolin' everybody
Lovin' everybody
Leavin' everybody yoo-hooEmbed
