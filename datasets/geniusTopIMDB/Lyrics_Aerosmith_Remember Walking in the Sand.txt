Remember (Walking in the Sand) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away, cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me

[Verse 2]
It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think
What shall I do
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no no no no no
Remember, walking in the sand
Remember, walking hand in hand
Remember, the night was so exciting
Remember, her smile was so inviting
Remember, then she touched my cheek
Remember, with her fingertips
Remember, softly
Softly we met with a kiss

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew?
The girl that said, she'd been true
Oh, whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you?
What will I do with it now?
Oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no no no no no
Remember, walking in the sand
Remember, walking hand in hand
Remember, the night was so exciting
Remember, her smile was so inviting
Remember, then she touched my cheek
Remember, with her fingertips
Remember, softly
Softly we met with a kiss
You might also like[Chorus]
Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew?
The girl that said, she'd been true
Oh, whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you?
What will I do with it now?
