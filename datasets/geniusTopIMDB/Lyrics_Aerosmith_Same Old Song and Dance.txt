Same Old Song and Dance Lyrics[Verse 1]
Get yourself a cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show
With the judge, constipation will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead

[Chorus]
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend

[Verse 2]
Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun
No smooth-face lawyer to get you undone
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around
[Chorus]
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend (Uh)
It's the same old story, same old story, same old song and dance

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Fate comes a-knocking, doors start locking
Your old time connection, change your direction
You ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
When you're low down and dirty, from walking the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

[Chorus]
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story, same old story, same old song and dance, yeahYou might also like2Embed
