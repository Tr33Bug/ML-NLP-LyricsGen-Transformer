Seasons of Wither Lyrics[Verse 1]
Loose-hearted lady, sleepy was she
Love for the devil brought her to me
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in

[Chorus]
Oh woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me, I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail
[Verse 2]
Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs that bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Can't say I'll be back too soon
They awaken, far far away
Heat of my candle show me the way
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in

[Chorus]
Oh woe is me, I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me, I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sailYou might also like1Embed
