Toys in the Attic Lyrics[Refrain]
In the attic, lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Verse]
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years
[Refrain]
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Chorus]
Toys, toys, toys in the attic
Toys, toys, toys in the attic
Toys, toys, toys in the attic
Toys, toys, toys in the attic

[Refrain]
Lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse]
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years

[Refrain]
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Real's the dream

Toys, toys, toys, we're in the attic
Toys, toys, toys in the attic
Toys, toys, toys in the attic2Embed
