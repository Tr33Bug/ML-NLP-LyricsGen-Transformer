Uncle Salty Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead
Her mammy was lusted, Daddy he was busted
They left her to be trusted 'til the orphan bleeds

[Chorus]
But when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane

[Verse 2]
Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby
That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead
[Chorus]
But when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane, ow!

[Bridge]
Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my window
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now she's doing any for money and a penny
A sailor with a penny or two or three
Hers is the cunning for men who come a-running
They all come for fun and it seems to me

[Chorus]
That when she cried at night, no one came
And when she cried at night, went insane

[Outro]
Ooh, it's a sunny day outside my windowYou might also like2Embed
