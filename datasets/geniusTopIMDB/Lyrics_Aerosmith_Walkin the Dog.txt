Walkinâ€™ the Dog Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mary Mac, all dressed in black
Silver buttons up and down her back
High, low, tipsy toe
She broke a needle now she can't sew

[Chorus]
Walkin' the dog
I'm just walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
[Verse 2]
Ask my mama for 15 cents
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high it touched the sky
Didn't come back 'til the 4th of July

[Chorus]
Walkin' the dog
I'm just walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

[Interlude]
Ha, uh, ha, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Instrumental Breaks]

[Verse 3]
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
How does your garden grow?
Well well, silver bells and little bitty bitty white shells
Pretty maids all in a row

[Chorus]
Walkin' your dog
I'm just walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dogYou might also likeEmbed
