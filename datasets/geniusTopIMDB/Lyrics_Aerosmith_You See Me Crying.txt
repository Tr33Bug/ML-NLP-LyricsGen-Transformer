You See Me Crying Lyrics[Intro]
You see me crying
Don't let it get you down
You see me crying
I'm back to the lost and found

[Chorus]
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I said
[Bridge]
You see me crying
Say you're a ladies man
You see me crying
So hard to understand

[Chorus]
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I said

[Verse 1]
You see me crying
Please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover
Let me take you to town
And I'll show you everything around
And I'm never gonna let you down
Cause my love is like a merry go round

[Chorus]
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, was the words I saidYou might also likeEmbed
