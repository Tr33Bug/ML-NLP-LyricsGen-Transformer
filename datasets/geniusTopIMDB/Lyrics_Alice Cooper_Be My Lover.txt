Be My Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
She struts into the room, well I don't know her
But with a magnifying glance, I just sorta look her over
We have a drink or two, well, maybe three
And then suddenly she starts telling me her life story
She says

[Chorus]
"Baby, if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own"
[Verse 2]
I told her that I came from Detroit City
And I played guitar in a long-haired rock and roll band
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice
I said "Listen baby, you really wouldn't understand"
And I said

[Chorus]
"Baby, if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own"
On my own

[Outro]
Oh, baby if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause it's a long, long way to paradise
And I'm still on my own
