Bed of Nails Lyrics[Intro]
I love the way you hurt me
My tears are your wine
Your thoughts would draw my plan for a cruise in vain
Like talons in the pale moon shining above us
The line between pleasure and pain has slowly vanished
As we sink deeper and deeper into a void of your venomous love

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we're gonna fight, we do it every night
Baby, when you scratch, you know I'm gonna bite
You can make me die, I can make you cry
Opposites attract, that's the reason why
[Pre-Chorus]
No one else could make you feel like I do, I do, I do
No one ever gets that deep inside you, as I do, baby

[Chorus]
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails

[Verse 2]
First we're gonna kiss, then we're gonna say
Dirty little words, only lovers say
Rocking through the night, rolling on the floor
When they hear us screaming, they'll be breaking down the door

[Pre-Chorus]
No one else could make you feel like I do, I do, I do
No one ever gets that deep inside you, as I do, baby

[Chorus]
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails

Bed of nails, bed of nails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Gonna drive you like hammer
Baby, put me in your slammer
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
No one else could make you feel like I do, I do, I do
No one ever gets that deep inside you, as I do, baby

[Chorus]
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails

[Chorus]
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
I'll lay you down and when all else fails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
[Hook]
Bed of nails, bed of nails
I'll drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow
Gonna drive you like hammer
Baby, put me in your slammer
Oh yeahEmbed
