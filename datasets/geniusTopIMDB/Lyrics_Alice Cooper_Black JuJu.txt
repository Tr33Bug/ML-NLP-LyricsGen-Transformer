Black JuJu Lyrics[Instrumental intro 0:00-2:01]

[Chorus]
Body
Body

[Verse 1]
Touched by the toil and plunged into his arm
Cursed thru the night through eyes of alarm
A melody black flowed out of my breath
Searching for death, but bodies need rest
[Chorus]
Body

[Verse 2]
Under the soil now waiting for worms
All that I feared is all that I've learned
All that I know is all that I think
Dead feelings are cool, down lower I sink

[Spoken bridge]
Bodies need rest
We all need our rest
Sleep an easy sleep
Rest, rest
Bodies need their rest
We all need our rest
Sleep an easy sleep
Rest, rest, rest, rest
But come back in the morning
Come back hard
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

[Chorus]
Bodies

[Verse 3]
Clutching and biting my soul has caught on fire
My evil is now and I'm caught up in desire
Everything I'm living for is all that I am
Liking it and loving it that's all in the plan
