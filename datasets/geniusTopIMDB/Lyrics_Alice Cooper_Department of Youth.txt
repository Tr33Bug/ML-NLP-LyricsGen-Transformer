Department of Youth LyricsWe're in trouble all the time
You read about us all in the papers
We walk around and bump into walls
A blind delegation
And we ain't afraid of high power
We're bullet proof
And we've never heard of Eisenhower
Missile power, justice or truth

We're the Department of Youth
Your new Department of Youth
We're the Department of Youth
Just me and youth
We talk about this whole stupid world
And still come out laughing, ha!
We never make any sense
But hell, that never mattered
But we'll make it through our blackest hour
We're living proof
And we've never heard of Billy Sunday
Damon Runyon, manners or couth

We're the Department of Youth
Your new Department of Youth
We're the Department of Youth
Just me and youth

We're the Department of Youth
The new Department of Youth
We're the Department of Youth
The new Department of Youth
We're the Department of Youth
We've got the power
We're the Department of Youth
We've got the power
We're the Department of Youth
We've got the power
"Who's got the power?"
"We do"
We're the Department of Youth
We've got the power
"We got the power"
"Yeah"
We're the Department of Youth
We've got the power
"We got the power"
"Yeah"
We're the Department of Youth
We've got the power
"And who gave it to you?"
"Donny Osmond"
"What?"You might also likeEmbed
