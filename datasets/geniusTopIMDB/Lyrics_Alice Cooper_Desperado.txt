Desperado Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a gambler and I'm a runner
But you knew that when you lay down
I'm a picture of ugly stories
I'm a killer and I'm a clown

[Chorus]
Step into the street by sundown
Step into your last goodbye
You're a target just by living
Twenty dollars will make you die
[Verse 2]
I wear lace and I wear black leather
My hands are lightning upon my gun
My shots are clean and my shots are final
My shots are deadly and when it's done

[Chorus]
You're as stiff as my smoking barrel
You're as dead as a desert night
You're a notch and I'm a legend
You're at peace and I must hide

[Chorus]
Tell me where the hell I'm going
Let my bones fall in the dust
Can't you hear that ghost that's calling
As my Colt begins to rust, in the dust

[Outro]
I'm a killer, I'm a clown
I'm a priest that's gone to townYou might also like1Embed
