Devil’s Food LyricsGet ready for the lady
She's gonna be a treat
Simmer slightly 'til ready
Make her soft too
Make her sweet

I kiss the tears off from your chest
I felt the poison fright that's in your breath
I knew your precious life and I know your death
I squeeze the love out of your soul
All the perfect love that's in your soul
You're just another spirit on parole
Devil's food
(You are) Devil's food
(You are) Devil's food

"Leaving Lepidoptera – please don't touch the displays, little boy; so cute – moving to the next aisle we have arachnida: the spiders, our finest collection. This friendly little devil is the Heptophilidae, unfortunately harmless. Next to him, the nasty Lycosa Raptoria; his tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of the skin. And here, my prize, the Black Widow. Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. Her kiss is fifteen times as poisonous as that of the Rattlesnake. You see, her venom is highly neuro-toxic, which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system - causing intense pain, profuse sweating, difficulty in breathing, loss of consciousness, violent convulsions and finally death. You know, I think what I love the most about her is her inborn need to dominate, possess. In fact, immediately after the consummation of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the specie, she kills and eats him. Oh, she is delicious, and I hope he was. Such power and dignity unhampered by sentiment. If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy; I feel that Man has ruled this world as stumbling, demented child-king long enough, and as his empire crumbles my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor."You might also likeEmbed
