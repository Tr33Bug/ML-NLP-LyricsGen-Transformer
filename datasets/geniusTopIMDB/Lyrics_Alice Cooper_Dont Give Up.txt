Don’t Give Up LyricsYeah, I know you’re struggling right now
We all are - in different ways
It’s like a new world that we don’t even know
It’s hard to sleep…even harder to dream
But look: you’ve got 7 billion brothers and sisters all in the same boat
So don’t panic. Life has a way of surviving and going on and on...
We’re not fragile - and we sure don’t break easy!

You know it’s so hard to cope
When you’re just hoping there’s hope…
We’re all hanging on by a thread
We’re all staring at the razor’s edge
But we’re not going to step off the ledge
No!

Our enemy is a cold, indiscriminate monster
It doesn’t care if you’re old or newborn…it exists to kill
You and I are nothing to it
It has no heart or soul or conscience
Do we fear it? Yeah
Do we cower before it? Hell no
We’re the blood and guts human race…and we win!

You know that it’s right
So we just gotta fight...
Yeah, we’re all hanging on by a thread
We’re all staring at the razor’s edge
But we’re not going to step off the ledge
No!

We’re all hanging on by a thread
We’re all staring at the razor’s edge
But we’re not going to step off the ledge
No!
