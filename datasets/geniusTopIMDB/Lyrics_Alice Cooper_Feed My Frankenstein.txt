Feed My Frankenstein Lyrics[Intro]
Yes, yes, I know you're hungry
And here comes dinner
(Feed my Frankenstein)

[Verse 1]
Well, I ain't evil
I'm just good lookin'
Start a little fire
Baby, start cookin'
I'm a hungry man
But I don't want pizza
I'll blow down your house
And then I'm gonna eat ya
Bring you to a simmer
Right on time
Run my greasy fingers
Up your greasy spine
[Chorus]
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time

[Verse 2]
You don't want to talk
So baby, shut up
And let me drink the wine
From your fur tea cup
Velcro candy, sticky sweet
Make my tattoos
Melt in the heat
Well, I ain't no veggie
Like my flesh on the bone
Alive and lickin' on your
Ice cream cone

[Chorus]
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time
You might also like[Bridge]
Baby whoa whoa, oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstein
Whoa whoa, baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstein

He's a psycho

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's lunch time
