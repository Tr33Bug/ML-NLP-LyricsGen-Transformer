Genuine American Girl LyricsI do my hair, I paint my nails
It pours outside, it never fails
So the makeup runs, down my pretty face
I'm a muddy mess, a MAC disgrace

But when I leave this room tonight
I'm gonna look and feel alright
'Cause my mama says the world's an oyster
And I'm the pearl

I'm a genuine American girl
A bonafide beauty in an ugly world
My vision of pure femininity
Yeah, I'm a genuine American girl
From my ruby red lips to my bleached blonde curls
I'm everything I hoped to be
I look in the mirror and what do I see?
That a modest little girl is looking back at me
The boys all whistle when I walk by
So I toss my hair and wink my eye

And when I hit the floor tonight
I'm gonna look and feel alright
'Cause my mama says the world's an oyster
And I'm the pearl

I'm a genuine American girl
I'm a rock and roll queen in a hip-hop world
My vision of pure femininity
Yeah, I'm a genuine American girl
From my ruby red lips to my bleached blonde curls
I'm everything I hoped to be

You think it's vanity
Or some insanity
But this is no-man's land
And I live here everyday

So come and dance with me
Come take a chance with me
I'm only thirty out of fifty shades of grey
What do you say?
You might also likeHey there, big boy
Why don't you come up and see me tonight?

And when we hit the floor tonight
We're gonna look and feel alright
'Cause my mama says the world's an oyster
And I'm the pearl

I'm a genuine American girl
A bonafide beauty in an ugly world
My vision of pure femininity
Yeah, I'm a genuine American girl
From my ruby red lips to my bleached blonde curls
I'm every He-Man's fantasy
A feminine fatality
You gotta know that I am
Everything I want to be, oh yeah

I'm everything I wanna be
Uh-huh, oh yeahEmbed
