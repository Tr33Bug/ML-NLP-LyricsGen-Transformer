Go to Hell Lyrics[Intro]
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to Hell

[Verse 1]
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly
For making us doubt our parent's authority
For choosing to be a living obscenity
You can go to Hell
[Hook]
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick

[Verse 2]
You'd poison a blind man's dog and steal his cane
You'd gift wrap a leper and mail him to your Aunt Jane
You'd even force-feed a diabetic a candy cane
You can go to Hell

[Instrumental break]

[Hook]
You're something that never should have happened
You'd even make your Grandma sick

[Outro]
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens you've enraged
You can go to Hell
