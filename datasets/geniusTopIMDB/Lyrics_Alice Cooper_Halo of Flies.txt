Halo of Flies Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got the answers to all of your questions
If you've got the money to pay me in gold
I will be living in old Monte Carlo
And you will be reading the secrets I sold

[Verse 2]
Daggers and contacts and bright shiny limos
I've got a watch that turns into a lifeboat
Glimmering nightgowns, poisonous as cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe
[Bridge]
The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks
And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash, halo of flies

[Verse 3]
I crossed the ocean, where no one would see
And I put a time-bomb in your submarine
Goodbye to old friends, the secret's in hand
With phonied up papers, and counterfeit plans
You never will understandYou might also like1Embed
