Hello Hooray Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello! Hooray! Let the show begin
I've been ready
Hello! Hooray! Let the lights grow dim
I've been ready

[Chorus]
Ready as this audience
Thatâ€™s coming here to dream
Loving every second
Every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long
To sing my song
And I've been waiting so long
For this thing to come
Yeah, I've been thinking so long
I was the only one
[Verse 2]
Roll out! Roll out
With your American dream and its recruits
I've been ready
Roll out! Roll out
With your circus freaks and hula hoops
I've been ready

[Chorus]
Ready as this audience
That's coming here to dream
Loving every second
Every moment, every scream
I've been waiting so long
To sing my song
And I've been waiting so long
For this thing to come
Oh, I've been thinking so long
I was the only one

[Bridge]
I can stand here strong and thin
And I can laugh when this thing begins

[Outro]
God, I feel so strong
I feel so strong
I'm so strong
I feel so strong, I feel so strong
So strong
God, I feel so strong
I am so strong
So strong
I feel so strong, I feel so strong
I feel so strong, I feel so strong
I feel so strong, feel so strong
I feel so strong, I feel so strong
So strongYou might also likeEmbed
