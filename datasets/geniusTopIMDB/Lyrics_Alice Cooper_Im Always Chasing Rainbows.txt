Iâ€™m Always Chasing Rainbows LyricsAt the end of the rainbow, there's happiness
And to find it how often I've tried
But my life is a race
Just a wild goose chase
And all my dreams have been denied

Why have I always been a failure
What can the reason be
I wonder if the world's to blame
I wonder if it could be me
I'm always chasing rainbows, watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky

Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
And some fellows make a winning sometime
And I never even make a gain
I'm always chasing rainbows waiting to find the little bluebird in vainYou might also likeEmbed
