Is It My Body Lyrics[Verse 1]
What have I got
That makes you want to love me?
Is it my body?
Or someone I might be?
Or somethin' inside me?

[Chorus]
You better tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out
Who I really am?
[Verse 2]
What does it take
To get inside of your mind?
Give me a break
And take a chance for the very first time

[Chorus]
You better tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out
Who I really am?

[Verse 1]
What have I got
That makes you want to love me?
Now, is it my body?
Or someone I might be?
Or somethin' inside me?

[Chorus]
You better tell me
Tell me
It's really up to you
Have you got the time to find out
Who I really am?
You might also like[Outro]
