Killer Lyrics[Verse 1]
What did I do to deserve such a fate
I didn't really want to get involved in this thing
Someone handed me this gun and I
I gave it everything
Yeah, I gave it everything

[Verse 2]
I came into this life, looked all around
I saw just what I liked and took what I found
Nothing came easy, nothing came free
And nothing came at all until they came after me
Yeah, yeah
[Instrumental break 1:52-3:54]
[Spoken section]
What did I do to deserve such a fate?
I didn't really want to get involved in this thing
Someone handed me a gun and I
I gave it everything
I gave it everything
(Sigh)
