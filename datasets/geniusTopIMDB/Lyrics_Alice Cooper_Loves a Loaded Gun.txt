Loveâ€™s a Loaded Gun Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody saw you at the station
You had your suitcase in your hand
You didn't give no information
You walked off with another man

I'm always standing in the shadows, baby
I watched you give yourself away
You take 'em home into your bedroom
You had another busy day
[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to look the other way and fake it
You push me to the limits
I can't take it

[Chorus]
One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill

[Verse 2]
Someday they'll put me in a squad car
Someday they'll throw away the key
But 'til that day I'll be a mad dog
'Cause that's what you taught me to be

You looked into the eyes of men above you
I was the one who really tried to love you

[Chorus]
One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill
You might also like[Guitar solo]
Pull the trigger

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to look the other way and fake it
You know, you push me right to the limit
I can't take it

[Chorus]
One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun

One down, one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
Red lights, stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes love's a loaded gun

[Outro]
