Spark in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]
Welcome to the party
It's only me and you
Tell the world to go away, babe
And I'll tell you what to do
Come over here and kiss me
I want to pull your hair
Turn out the lights and hold me
I want to touch you everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't need nobody, baby
We don't need champagne
I'll take you to the deepest, darkest, hottest, lovers' lane
[Chorus]
For a little spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Don't matter where we sleep
Don't matter where we park
All we need is a spark, spark, spark in the dark
Spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark

[Verse 2]
I'll come around midnight
We'll be crawlin' on the floor
Burnin' with the fever
And yellin' out for more
But don't you write it in your diary, baby
Don't blab it on the phone
'Cause if your mom and dad find out
They'll skin me to the bone

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we don't need instructions, baby
Don't you be afraid
It takes a little friction, ha-ha
That's how our love is made

[Chorus]
From a little spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Don't matter what you say
No matter what you do
As long as it is me and you
We got a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark, yeah
You might also like[Bridge]
We don't need nobody, baby
We don't need cocaine
I'll take you to the deepest, darkest, hottest lovers' lane

[Chorus]
Spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Don't matter where we sleep
Don't matter where we park
All we need is a spark, spark, spark in the dark
Spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark

Don't matter what you say
No matter what you do
As long as it is me and you
We got a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark, yeah

[Outro]
Just a little spark in the dark
I need a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
A little tiny spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark2Embed
