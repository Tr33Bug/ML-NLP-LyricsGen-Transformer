Steven LyricsI don't want to see you go
I don't even want to be there
I will cover up my eyes
And pray it goes away

You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming
I don't like to hear you cry
You just don't know how deep that cuts me
So I will cover up my eyes
And it will go away
You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming

STEVEN!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!
STEVEN!
Is someone calling me? I hear my name!
STEVEN!
That icy breath that whispers screams of pain!
I don't want to feel you die
But if that's the way that God has planned you
I'll put pennies on your eyes
And it will go away
See?

You've only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming, please stop screaming

Steven.... Is someone calling me? No....
Steven....
I think I hear a voice--- it's outside the door!
STEVEN!
I hear my name!
STEVEN!
Is someone calling me? I hear my name!
STEVEN!
