Teenage Lament â€™74 LyricsWhat a drag it is
In these gold lame jeans
Is this the coolest way
To get though your teens?
Well I cut my hair weird
I read that it was in
I look like a rooster
That was drowned and raised again

What are you going to do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do
Why don't you get away?
I'm going to leave today
I ran into my room
And I fell down on my knees
Well I thought that fifteen
Was going to be a breeze
I picked up my guitar
To blast away the clouds
Somebody in the next room yelled
You got to turn that damn thing down

What are you going to do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do
Why don't you get away?
Well I'm going to cry all day

And I know trouble is brewing out there
But I can hardly care
They fight all night about his private secretary
Lipstick stain, blonde hair

[Guitar Solo]

What are you going to do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do
Why don't you run away?
I'm going to leave today
But even I don't know what I'm going to do
Don't know what I'm going to do
No

I'll tell you what I'm going to do
Why don't you run away?
I'm going to leave today

What are you going to do?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do
Why don't you get away?
I'd rather to cry all day1Embed
