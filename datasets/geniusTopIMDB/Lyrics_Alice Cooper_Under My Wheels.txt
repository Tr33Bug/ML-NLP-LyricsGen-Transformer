Under My Wheels Lyrics[Chorus]
The telephone is ringing
You got me on the run
I'm driving in my car now
Anticipating fun
I'm driving right up to you, babe
I guess that you couldn't see, yeah, yeah
But you were under my wheels, honey
Why don't you let me be?

[Verse]
'Cause when you call me on the telephone
Saying, “take me to the show”
And then I say, “honey, I just can't go
Old lady's sick and I can't leave her home”
[Chorus]
Telephone is ringing
You got me on the run
I'm driving in my car now
I got you under my wheels
I got you under my wheels
I got you under my wheels
Got you, under my wheels, yeah yeah
I got you under my wheels

[Chorus]
Aw! Telephone is ringing
You got me on the run
I'm driving in my car now
Anticipating fun
I'm driving right up to you, babe
I guess that you couldn't see
Yeah, yeah, yeah
But you went under my wheels, honey
Why don't you let me be? Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Got you under my wheels, yeah, yeah
I got you under my wheels, wheels, wheels
Got you, got you, got you
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, under my wheels
Got you under my wheels
We-we-we-we-we-we, wheels
We-we-we, wheels
We-we-we-we-we-we
We-we-we-we-we-we-we, wheelsYou might also likeEmbed
