Years Ago LyricsHere I go again
Up and down alone
All my friends went home
Years ago

All my toys are broken and
So am I inside mom
The carnival has closed
Years ago
I'm a little boy
No, I'm a great big man
No, let's be a little boy
For a little while longer
Maybe an hour?
No Steven
We have to go back now
Isn't that our mom calling?
"Steven come home!"You might also likeEmbed
