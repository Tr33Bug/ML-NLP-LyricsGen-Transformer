A Song for You Lyrics[Verse]
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly, can't you see?
Ooh, here's no one more important to me
So, darling, won't you please see through me?
Because we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you, yeah, yeah
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholding nothing
You came out in front, well, baby I was hiding
But now, I'm so much better, with my words coming together
Listen to the melody, 'cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
Because you the boy next door and a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember
Being together and I was singing this song for you, yeah
[Outro]
We were alone and I was singing this song
Singing this song, yeah, yeah, yeah
We were all alone
And I was singing my song for you, you, you
We were alone and I was singing our song for you

[Spoken Outro]
You know what? Donny Hathaway, you know what
I see Donny Hathaway is like, um, my Carleen Anderson
Like on Marvin Gaye, like, great, but
Donny Hathaway, like...he couldn't contain himself
He had something in him, you know?You might also like3Embed
