Best Friends, Right? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly, you hate me, too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we're best friends, right?
You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
You don't want me in the flat when you're home at night
But we are best friends, right?

[Chorus]
You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between
[Verse 2]
Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anythin'
I can't even think about how you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?
I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame, blame
You want me to suffer just 'cause you was born wide
But we are best friends, right?

[Chorus]
You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

[Verse 3]
I had love for you when I was four
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla and you get the dro
'Cause we are best friends, right, right, right?

[Outro]
'Cause we are best friends, right?
Because we are best friends, right?You might also like5Embed
