Brother Lyrics[Verse 1]
Brother, there's so much that I could never say to your face
But by now, you should know the world and all its ways
So find your place
How do I find words that do not condescend?
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
A son, not a sob story, ooh

[Chorus]
(Now you must look out for her the way she did for you)
And your priority, it must be her
(Now you must look out for her the way she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were, ooh
[Verse 2]
She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now where life turns around
My brother
Realise that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like it's a run-through
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
(Now you must look out for her the way she did for you)
Ooh, your priority, it must be her
(Now you must look out for her the way she did for you)
(Now you must look out)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were
(Now you must look out for her the way she did for you)
(Now you must)
And your priority, it must be her
(Now you must look after her the way she did for you)
(Now you must look out for her)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were

[Outro]
The way we were
We'll never be
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And your priority, it must be her
Ooh-ooh-oohYou might also likeEmbed
