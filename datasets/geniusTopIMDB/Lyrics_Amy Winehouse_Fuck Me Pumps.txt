Fuck Me Pumps Lyrics[Intro]
Woo

[Verse 1]
When you walk in the bar
And you're dressed like a star
Rockin' your "eff me" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballerâ€™s wife
[Chorus]
You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller

[Verse 2]
You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed

[Chorus]
You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller
You might also like[Verse 3]
You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned

[Bridge]
Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your "fuck me" pumps16Embed
