TranslationsFran√ßaisHe Can Only Hold Her Lyrics[Intro]
Woah, ooh
Oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh

[Verse 1]
He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks, "What's she running from?"
[Chorus]
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies

[Verse 2]
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

[Chorus]
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies

[Outro]
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her, it never dies
So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never diesYou might also like20Embed
