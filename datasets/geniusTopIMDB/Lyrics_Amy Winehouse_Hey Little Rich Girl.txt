Hey Little Rich Girl Lyrics[Intro]
I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco when everyone was in jeans

[Chorus]
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn-out dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

[Verse 1]
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a taste unknown
[Chorus]
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn-out dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?

[Verse 2]
Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote you in this song
Hey, little rich girl, baby, love is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong
At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache because the screen star was you
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on a dream

[Chorus]
But you were just a rich girl and only having fun
Your worn-out dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?You might also like3Embed
