In My Bed Lyrics[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
It's not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singin'
It's something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is slowin' down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There's nothin' new to learn

[Chorus]
You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise, mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, it's you again
Listen, this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed

[Verse 2]
I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did
Now, it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Everythin' is slowing down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There's nothin' new to learn

[Chorus]
You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise, mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, it's you again
Listen, this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed10Embed
