My Own Way (Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've never been in love before
Such a foolish thing to be
Seems to me the price is high
So I'll keep my own company
And I'll do what I want, when I feel

[Verse 2]
Watch them fall so easily
Temporary insanity
Some say that true love is blind
Me, I like to clarify
While I, I just take my own time and I
[Chorus]
I'll go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk, talk, when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk, talk, when I wanna

[Verse 3]
Seems to be illogical
Love that's unconditional, yeah
Give your all to someone else
But save a little for yourself
That's why I'm, I'm taking my own time, and I'm

[Chorus]
I'll go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk, talk when I wanna, yeah
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk, talk when I wanna

[Bridge]
Don't get me wrong, it's kinda cynical
But it scares me though
So I'm careful with my heart
It's the only one I got
I cannot commit to that shit

I'll go my own way (Oh, yeah)
I'll talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk, I talk when I wanna
I'll go my own way (I'll go my own way)
And I'll walk when I wanna and tell you when I wanna
My own way my own way, yeah, yeah (I'll go my own way)
When I wanna, when I wanna, when I wanna1Embed
