[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

[Verse 2]
The man said "Why do you think you here?"
I said, "I got no idea"
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near

[Pre-Chorus]
He said, "I just think you're depressed"
This, me: "Yeah, baby, and the rest"

[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

[Verse 3]
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried
[Chorus]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go53Embed
