Tears Dry (Original Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
All I can ever be to you is the darkness we once knew
And this deep regret I had to get accustomed to
Once it felt so right, anticipation at its height
Lived and waited in hotel rooms late at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
With every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I let myself get so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to cut myself off, I had no capacity
[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)

[Verse 2]
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things than him at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
And this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)

[Verse 3]
Wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
And as we kiss goodbye, the sun behind you sets
So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see
You might also like[Chorus]
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
Baby, in your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)

[Outro]
Yeah, in your grey, this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)
In your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)
In your grey, in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)2Embed
