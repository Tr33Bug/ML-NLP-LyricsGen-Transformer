To Know Him Is to Love Him (Live) Lyrics[Chorus]
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I do, I do

[Verse]
Oh, I'll be good to him
I'll bring joy to him
Oh, oh, everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, I do
[Bridge]
Why can't he see?
How blind can he be?
Someday, he'll see
That he was meant for me

[Outro]
Oh, oh, to know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile
Oh, it makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, and I doYou might also like1Embed
