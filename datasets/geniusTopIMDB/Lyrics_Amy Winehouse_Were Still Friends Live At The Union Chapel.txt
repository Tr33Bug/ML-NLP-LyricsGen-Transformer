Weâ€™re Still Friends (Live At The Union Chapel) Lyrics[Intro]
Um, yeah, I wanna do a couple Donnie Hathaway tunes...um...yeah, yeah, this song here tonight, he never comes to see me play who I love to pieces, uh, um, yeah, this song's for him

[Verse 1]
Hello, friend
How has it been?
Ain't it wonderful you've got a friend?
'Cause though we've changed in our endeavors
I found we still have some things in common

[Chorus]
Now ain't it strange and wonderful
That we're still friends?
We're, we're still friends
[Verse 2]
Through our heart, we never parted
And through our living
Was friends, as friends, friendships all
And the way we are when we're together
Lets us know that we still love one another, oh

[Chorus]
Now ain't it strange and wonderful
That we're, we're still friends?
We're still friends
We're still friends
We're still friendsYou might also like1Embed
