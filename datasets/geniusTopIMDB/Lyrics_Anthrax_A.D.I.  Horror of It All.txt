A.D.I. / Horror of It All Lyrics



It's just too damn easy, to die in this life
Who's making the decisions?
Tell me, who's got the right?
Woah, oh, oh, my grief turns to anger
Woah, oh, oh, it's time to...

Say good-bye, it's a horror
Memories, nothing's harder

I know there's no answer, I mean, what did I expect?
So many unanswered questions
I can't believe, I can't accept

Woah, oh, oh, my anger turns to hatred
Woah, oh, oh, It's time to...

Say good-bye, it's a horror
Memories, nothing's harder

Woah, oh, oh, the horror of it all
The horror of it all, I'm gonna break
The horror of it all, tell me why
You might also like
You're not supposed to question, but why's there so much pain
When someone's taken from you
What can you do or say?

Woah, oh, oh, my hatred turns to violence
Woah, oh, oh, it's time to...

Say good-bye, it's a horror
Memories, nothing's harder

Woah, oh, oh, the horror of it all
The horror of it all, I'm gonna break
The horror of it all, tell me why
Woah!
Ahaha!

Woah!

The horror of it all
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
Say good-bye, It's such a horror
My memories there's nothing harder
Anger and hatred fill the page
Smash the walls, it's time to rage
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
Anger and hatred fill the page
Smash the walls, it's time to rage1Embed
