A.I.R. Lyrics
Young and free, something you'll never be
A childhood's end, it's lunacy
Pure dictation, they don't listen
And you're just waiting for what you're missing

Welcome to your nightmare
You just can't walk away
It's time for you to choose your fate
You just can't let it lay
Welcome to our nightmare
Your whole life's on the way, today
You're no good, misunderstood
A.I.R
All their hopes and visions
Of what they want you to be
Crucial times, made up minds
A.I.R
So high and mighty
Though much too blind to see

Who are you gonna live your life for?
Conformity will trap you like a locked door
Independence means owning your decisions
Authority will put your soul in prison

Welcome to your nightmare
You just can't walk away
It's time for you to choose your fate
You just can't let it lay
Welcome to your nightmare
Your whole life's on the way, today

You're no good, misunderstood
A.I.R
All their hopes and visions
Of what they want you to be
Crucial times, made up minds
A.I.R
So high and mighty
Though much too blind to see
You might also like
Fight or go insane, there's no-one else to blame
Stop their influence, you can't give them a chance
Break right through the wall that separates us all
Start your second life without their hands in sight

Oh!

You got your pride
You got your visions
Don't subside, don't ever give in, no
Don't compromise, just keep on grinning
The games they play
You just keep on winning

Keep on winning, keep on winning
Keep on winning
A.I.REmbed
