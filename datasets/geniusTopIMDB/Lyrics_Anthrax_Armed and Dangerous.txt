Armed and Dangerous Lyrics
Ooh
Trapped up inside here
Like lions in a cage
I've been a mark of injustice
Bound by these chains
I can't find a reason
On my own
My destiny waits for a sign from me
I'm leaving alone
Yeah, hey
So cold
Oh, so cold

Oh, I'm out on my way now
It's been so many years
The chase is my lifeblood
I have no more fears


Fire burns in my veins
Anger shows on my face
Hatred poisons my soul
Look out, I'm about to explode

Evil ones try to destroy us
We're armed and prepared for attack
We'll take on the world with rebellion
We're dangerous down to the last

Armed and dangerous
Oh-oh, armed and dangerous
You might also like
Ooh, am I evil or am I insane?
The lion inside of me is no longer tame
A blade in my left, ooh, a gun in my right
To beat you within an inch of your life

Evil ones try to destroy us
We're armed and prepared for attack
We'll take on the world with rebellion
We're dangerous down to the last

Armed and dangerous
Oh-oh, armed and dangerous


Ooh, armed and dangerous
Oh, armed and dangerous
So armed and dangerous
Oh-oh, armed and dangerous

Fire burns in my veins
Anger shows on my face
Hatred poisons my soul
Look out, I'm about to explode
Evil ones try to destroy us
We're armed and prepared for attack
We'll take on the world with rebellion
We're dangerous down to the last

Armed and dangerous
Oh-oh, armed and dangerous
Oh, armed and dangerous
Oh, armed and dangerous


Oh-oh-ohEmbed
