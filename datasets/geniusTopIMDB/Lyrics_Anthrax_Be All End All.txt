Be All, End All Lyrics

Yes, no, yes, no
Not another word
You'll know what to do
Right, in your face they see it
In their face you take it
Make up their minds
Aggression turns the screws
Fight, take your place and hold it
Make your piece and stand up
You know what it means
Wake up, time to live your dreams
Down by
Law and they can't hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideals
Down by
Law and no-one owns you
And all the shit they've thrown you
Payback is a real bitch

Nothing's ever easy when you do it yourself
All you can do is try
Life's not unfair, life's just life
Death not suicide

Be all and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Be all and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
You might also like
Think on your feet and stay one step ahead
Break, take your brain and use it
Take their mind and change an attitude
Like you'd change your shorts
Right, in your face they see it
In their face you stand up
You know what it means
Wake up, time to live your dreams

Down by
Law and they can't hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideals
Down by
Law and no-one owns you
And all the shit they've thrown you
Payback is a real bitch

Nothing's ever easy when you do it yourself
All you can do is try
Life's not unfair, life's just life
Death not suicide
Be all and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Be all and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria

Always taking, always faking
Ignorance is so frustrating
Always taking, always faking
Ignorance is no way
No way, no way, no way out


Be all and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Be all and you'll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
