Blood Eagle Wings Lyrics
Everything's been said, walk among the dead, you can see my crimes, this is my design
There's no right or wrong, it's the same old song, just keeps pounding me, hits so hard

Hell is empty, 'cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly, hit so hard

Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
My whole world built on, bodies dead and gone, you ignored the signs, that was my design
And the loneliness, hits so hard in this, grey place that exists, in my mind

Hell is empty, 'cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly, hit so hard

Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings

I ask you
Why, why fight everything?
Why can't you accept it?
You can never stop it
And I don't want to try
A weak half measured lie
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die

I showed you
Why, why fight everything?
Not what you expected?
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I don't have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die
You might also like
I showed you
Why, why fight everything?
Not what you expected?
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I don't have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
I'd rather see it die
I'd rather see it die

Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings

I show you
I ask you
I show you

Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
I ask you
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
I show you
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
I ask you
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings1Embed
