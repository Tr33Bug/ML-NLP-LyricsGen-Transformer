Caught in a Mosh Lyrics
"Why don't you listen when I try to talk to you?
Stop thinking of yourself for just a second, fool
Shut up, shut up, I don't wanna hear your mouth
Your mother made a monster, now get the hell out of my house"

Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp the idiot convention
Which one of these words don't you understand?
Oh, caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
"Don't tell me how to do my job
There's the door, your name's on the knob
You're always in the way like a beast on my back
Were you dropped as a baby? 'Cause brain you lack"

Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp the idiot convention
Which one of these words don't you understand?
Oh, caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand!

What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!

(Aw!)
"Think before you speak
Or suffer for your words
Learn to give respect that others give to you
Oh, the best you can do"


(Hey man);
I'm trying to reason, but you don't understand
Talking in circles, we'll never get it straight
Just you and me in our theater of hate

Can't stand it for another day
I ain't gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat, my fists are clenching
Stomp, stomp, stomp the idiot convention
Which one of these words don't you understand?
Oh, caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand!

What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!
What is it? Caught in a mosh!2Embed
