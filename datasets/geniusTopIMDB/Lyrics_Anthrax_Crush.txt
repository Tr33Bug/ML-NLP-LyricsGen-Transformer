Crush Lyrics

Now you see me, now you don't
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you see me, now you don't

Now you see me, now you don't
Go before I am the goat
You get away with murder
Kill me when you're through
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you?
You get away with murder
What do I have to do?
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you?
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
To be loved by you

From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Won't you crush on me?
Crush on me, crush on me
Crush on me, crush on me
Crush on me, crush on me, crush on

Pile your dead on top of me
Pile your dead on top of me
Pile your dead on top of me
You might also like
Pile your dead on top of me
Tape my eyes so I can't see

You get away with murder
Kill me when you're through
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you?
You get away with murder
What do I have to do?
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you?
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
To be loved by you

From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Won't you crush on me?
Crush on me, crush on me
Crush on me, crush on me
Crush on me, crush on me, crush on

I've been waiting for today
(Won't you crush on me, crush on me?)
I can't touch you when you're far away
(Crush on me, crush on me)
Nothing makes me feel this way
(Crush on me, crush on me)
Except hate, but that fades away
(Crush on me, crush on)

From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Won't you crush on me?
Crush on me, crush on me
Crush on me, crush on me
Crush on me, crush on me, crush on

I've been waiting for today
(Won't you crush on me, crush on me?)
I can't touch you when you're far away
(Crush on me, crush on me)
Nothing makes me feel this way
(Crush on me, crush on me)
Except hate, but that fades away
(Crush on me, crush on)
