Deathrider Lyrics
Woah!

Riding hard, high in the saddle
A winged steed of unwearing flight
Sweeping through air just like fire
Swift of the foot, great of might

Hear the screams (Ah!)
Feel the bite
We ride with death
Tonight
Conquering all, spreading terror
Hoofs gallop in thunderous pound
Devouring the souls of the wretched
Trampling them down to the ground

Hear the screams (Ah!)
Feel the bite
We ride with death
Tonight

Here it comes
You better hide
Shoot the guns
You're gonna die

(Ah, yeah!)

Gripping the reins of destruction
Spikes made of steel on his hands
Holder of forces immortal
Slaughtering all in his path
You might also like
Hear the screams (Ah!)
Feel the bite
We ride with death
Tonight
