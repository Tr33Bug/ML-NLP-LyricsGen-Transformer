Fight ’Em ’til You Can’t Lyrics
"City authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from their graves and attacking the living."

When did this begin?
This curse as old as sin
Reality is bleeding at the core
Brilliant savagery
Decapitate and bleed
Off the spoiled seed 'til it's pure
The darkest Devil nightmare, blacker than their evil souls
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
God save us, prayers fall on deaf ears - so put your faith in force
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
The murder in your eyes is just the will to stay alive
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
'Cause there's no humanity when the dead come back to feed
You gotta fight 'em, fight 'em

In the end of everything
The dead will rise and sing
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more
The world is only blood
When rage becomes your love
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more

I will end you
Kill and kill the thing
It's mind-shattering
When murder is the only cure
Brilliant savagery
Decapitate and bleed
Off the spoiled seed 'til it's pure

The darkest Devil nightmare, blacker than their evil souls
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
God save us, prayers fall on deaf ears - so put your faith in force
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
The murder in your eyes is just the will to stay alive
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
'Cause there's no humanity when the dead come back to feed
You gotta fight 'em, fight 'em

In the end of everything
The dead will rise and sing
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more
The world is only blood
When rage becomes your love
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more
No more, no more, no more!

The darkest Devil nightmare, blacker than their evil souls
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
God save us, prayers fall on deaf ears - so put your faith in force
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
The murder in your eyes is just the will to stay alive
You gotta fight 'em
I'll end you
'Cause there's no humanity when the dead come back to feed
You gotta fight 'em, fight 'em
In the end of everything
The dead will rise and sing
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more
The world is only blood
When rage becomes your love
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more
In the end of everything
The dead will rise, rise and sing
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more
The world is left with only blood
Rage becomes your only love
Fight 'em 'til you can't fight no more
No more, no more, no more!Embed
