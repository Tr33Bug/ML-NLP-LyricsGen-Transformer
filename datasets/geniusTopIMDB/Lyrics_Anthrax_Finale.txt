Finale Lyrics
Life can be so wonderful
Real love this time you fool
And then you wake up
And you'd chew off your own arm
Or face the only graduate from Satan's school of charm

I hear your mama calling you
I hear your mama calling you
You'd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama calling you
I drink three six packs, just so I can look at your face
Finally
You give respect, you get respect
And you just don't know your place
Finally
You never learn, you always burn
Now I've got you off my case
Finally
I drank three six packs, just so I could look at your face
Finally
See ya
Over, finished, gone, done, out

She's not the one you married
Not the one who cared
Maybe it's her evil twin that got you by the short hairs
Can you live without it?
Can you be a man?
Can you tell her take a walk and stick it up her can?

I hear your mama calling you
I hear your mama calling you
You'd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama calling you
You might also like
I drink three six packs, just so I can look at your face
Finally
You give respect, you get respect
And you just don't know your place
Finally
You never learn, you always burn
Now I've got you off my case
Finally
I drank three six packs, just so I could look at your face
Finally
See ya
Over, finished, gone, done out

I hear your mama calling you
I hear you mama calling you
Now go and pack your bags we're through
I hear you mama calling you

Rape my mind led down the wrong path
One too many rides and you crashed
Had the looks but had no class
Steal my life and taint my past
Sorry I don't mean to laugh
How long have you been waiting to be set free?
Don't you know it's easy as 1, 2, 3
Don't be a faggot now that's the key
Don't you know it's easy as 1, 2, 3

Now I'm free, now I'm free, me me me, finally
Over, finished, gone, done outEmbed
