Hy Pro Glo Lyrics
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Who, what, where, when, why?
How many ways can you lie?
How many ways can you try?
How many ways can you die?

What am I gonna do?
I can't look at you
What are you gonna do?
You're no hypocrite
I bash my head
Against your wall every day
You'd bash your head
Against a wall anyway
And then you'd turn to look
To see if I care
But I can't and I never did
What did you expect me to give?
You never deserved my respect
How many ways can you try?
It burns a hole inside your mind

What am I gonna do?
I can't look at you
I can't look like you
I'm no hypocrite
What are you gonna do?
You love to look at you
You don't have a clue
You're no hypocrite

You've got a hole inside
That you have to feed
You've got a hole
You'll use to get what you need
And then you turn to look to see if I care
See if I care

But I can't and I never did
What did you expect me to give?
You never deserved my respect
How many ways can you try?
It burns a hole inside your mind
You might also like
What am I gonna do?
I can't look at you
I can't look like you
I'm no hypocrite
What are you gonna do?
You love to look at you
You don't have a clue
You're no hypocrite

It burns a hole inside my mind
It burns a hole inside my mind
You've got that look I wanna know
You've got that look
The Hy Pro Glo
It burns a hole inside my mind
It burns a hole inside my mind
You've got that look I wanna know
You've got that look
The Hy Pro Glo
It burns a hole inside my mind
It burns a hole inside my mind

I, I, I, I, I, I
Who, what, where, when, why?
How many ways can you lie?
How many ways can you try?
How many ways can you die?

What am I gonna do?
I can't look at you
I can't look like you
I'm no hypocrite
What are you gonna do?
You love to look at you
You don't have a clue
You're no hypocriteEmbed
