Iâ€™m Alive Lyrics
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa...

Look into my holy eyes
An empty smile and you're hypnotised
Selling lies, my enterprise
The sheep just get in line
Capitulate so easily
The power of fear that I'm traffickin'
Years of sleep have made you blind
I made the bed you're in
As I lead the child to war again (War again)
Heaven lives in every gun
I'll damn you!

I'm alive to be the demon
I'm alive to be the one
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Hell, it lives in everyone

When your world has slipped away
And all you have is me to pay
Once so proud, you beg for more
And spread your legs like some dirty whore

As I lead the child to war again (War again)
Heaven lives in every gun
I'll damn you!

I'm alive to be the demon
I'm alive to be the one
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Hell, it lives in everyone
I'm alive to be the demon
I'm alive to be the one
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Hell, it lives...
You might also like
I'm invited
I'm invited
One nation under
One nation under me!

As I lead the child to war again
As I lead the child to war again
As I lead the child to war
Heaven lives, lives in every gun

I'm alive to be the demon
I'm alive to be the one
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Hell, it lives in everyone
I'm alive to be the demon
I'm alive to be the one
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Hell, it lives in everyone
I'm alive to be the demon
I'm alive to be the one
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Hell, it lives in everyone...Embed
