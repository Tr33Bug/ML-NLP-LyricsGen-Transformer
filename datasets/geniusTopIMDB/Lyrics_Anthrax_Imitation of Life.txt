Imitation of Life Lyrics
There's nothing I hate more than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises, and all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out
They're just an imitation of what life's all about

"Because of me you are who you are
So sign your name, and you'll go far
I'm your friend, I think you should
So sign your name, it's for your own good"
How many times have you heard this today?
Some bogus piss-on saying "Let's do lunch babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife (Imitation of life)
Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns

Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend

"Take my advice, and listen to me
A great opportunity, can't you see
I only want what's best for you
The deal of a lifetime, what more can I do?"
How many times have you heard this today?
Some stupid sucker says "It's great, we luv ya babe"
For them this bullshit, it's their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife (Imitation of life)

Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns

Bands dress like women, with hairspray and lace
I'd pass an image law, stick it in their face
Let's see how long they keep dressing this way
Wearing this image twenty four hours a day...
You might also like
Did you ever think for yourself?
Just once, did you ever think?
That's all I want to know

Imitation of life, living out a lie
You'll never be right, imitation of life
Why are you here?
You're taking up my space
The new imperfect race, imitation of life


Oh, oh, oh
Anger burns

Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation, a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change, I still call him friend

There's nothing I hate more than all these plastic people
And all their plastic promises, and all their plastic deals
They just can't be themselves, and live their own lives out
They're just an imitation of what life's all about
