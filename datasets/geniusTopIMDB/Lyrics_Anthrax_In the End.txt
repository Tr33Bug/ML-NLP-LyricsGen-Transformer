In the End Lyrics
Lone star was dark tonight
Our diamond shined so bright
I watched it go further than he ever dreamed
I can't take it
No matter how I try, I can't stop asking why
'Cause something's broken
Scarred, and it breaks my heart
I won't take it, can't break it

In the end, I'm pounding on the door
But it's already over
Too little, too late
In the end, you'll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me
And when the greatest falls, Heaven and Hell will call
Stand up and fight
On and on, this memory screams
I can't take it
Stand up and fight withal
I won't take it, can't break it

In the end, I'm pounding on the door
But it's already over
Too little, too late
In the end, you'll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

In the end, I'm kicking down the door
And I'm taking this over
I'm cleaning the slate
In the end, you'll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me

Did I thank you for our time together?
Did I thank you for making me better?
Did I thank you for being the one I would bleed and kill for?
Did I thank you for tearing my head off?
Ripping my heart out?
Fucking my world?
Did we tell you how much that we loved you?
Did we tell you, you made our dreams come true?
Did we tell you that you were the one?
Paving our way, the damage is done
Did we thank you for tearing our heads off?
Ripping our hearts out?
Fucking our world?
You might also likeI can't break it down

In the end, I'm pounding on the door
But it's already over
Too little, too late
In the end, you'll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

In the end, I'm kicking down the door
And I'm taking this over
I'm cleaning the slate
In the end, you'll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me1Embed
