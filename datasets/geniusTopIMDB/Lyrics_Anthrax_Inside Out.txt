Inside Out Lyrics
I thought I knew what provocation was
I thought I knew what provocation was
I've eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason

It's in my stomach like fire, like cancer
And like a knife, I've been gunshot
It's in my stomach like fire, like cancer
And like a knife, I've been gunshot
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go, gotta let it go, yeah
It's in my stomach like fire
In my stomach like cancer
In my stomach like a knife, I've been gunshot
Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out

My only antidote to mental suffering
Is physical pain
I've eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason
I've eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason

It's in my stomach like fire, like cancer
And like a knife, I've been gunshot
It's in my stomach like fire, like cancer
And like a knife, I've been gunshot
Gotta let it go, gotta let it go, gotta let it go, yeah
It's in my stomach like fire
In my stomach like cancer
In my stomach like a knife, I've been gunshot

Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out
Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out, out, out

Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out, yeah
Goddamn, nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Can't break a heart so strong with pride
It's more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you, I'm out, out, out, out, out2Embed
