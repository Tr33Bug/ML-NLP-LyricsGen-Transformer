Keep It in the Family Lyrics

Mankind
The public enemy's not the man who speaks his mind
The public enemy's the man that goes and acts blind
Searching for an answer that he'll never find
An action from reaction and you can't make a retraction
Once you've put your head out
And then you're blue in the face as you try to state your case
You can think with your dick but it can't shout
Yo, I try to understand what the Hell is going on
I can't imagine how things ever got so far gone
You separatists say you want your own state
I'll give them a state, a state of unconsciousness
Retribution, no solution, constitution
Discrimination through the nation
Raining hatred
I yell
When there's schism, you must rebel
I yell, so you'll hear
I yell, I refuse to live in your Hell
I am what you fear

I'm the truth
I don't keep it in the family
Live your life, take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall

Keep it in the, keep it in the
Keep it in the family
You might also like
Don't even try to tell me what you think is right
When to you blacks are niggers and Jews are kikes
And you expect to be taken seriously
But your actions, they're more than curiously juvenile
You emulate what you hate
And you don't even know why you feel this way
Cause daddy hated this, and mommy hated that
And your own ability to reason's like a tire gone flat

Yo, I try to understand what the Hell is going on
I can't imagine how things ever got so far gone
You separatists say you want your own state
I'll give them a state, a state of unconsciousness
Retribution, no solution, constitution
Discrimination through the nation
Raining hatred
I yell
When there's schism, you must rebel
I yell, so you'll hear
I yell, I refuse to live in your Hell
I am what you fear

I'm the truth
I don't keep it in the family
Live your life, take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the family
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the family


Acting out of pure cold hatred
'Cause of what another's race is
Color of another's face is
Different and your own frustrations
Taking on a violent nature
Full of hate, so full of hate
You'd kill a man, is that your fate?
Your street becomes a police state
Why the Hell do you hate?

Hate (One), hate (Two), hate (Three) ,hate (Four), hate (Five)
Hate (Six), hate (Seven), hate (Eight), hate (Nine)

I'm not gonna stand for it
Someone's gonna pay for it
I yell, we rebel

We're the truth and
We don't keep it in the family
Live your life, take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the family

I'm the thing that you most fear
I don't keep it in the family
I'm the truth you won't hear
Keep it in the family
The real world's outside your door
You can't keep it in the family
You've got the longest way to fall

Keep it in the family
Keep it in the family
Keep it in the family
Keep it in the familyEmbed
