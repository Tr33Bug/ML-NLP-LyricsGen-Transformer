Make Me Laugh Lyrics

Spread the word
Through me God is heard
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
Evangelist
You're making me laugh
Jesus saves
But only after I've been paid
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
Evangelist
End your hoax
God says have a T.V. show
God says baby do some blow
God says taxes are a sin
God says pour the money in
Rape the poor, faith no more
Faith for cash, make me laugh
Faith no more, face the whore
Rape your past, make me laugh

Never, never, ever sin
Unless God says to stick it in
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
Evangelist
The truth can choke
Defrocked from your seat
Don't shit where you eat
You're making me laugh
Tell me your killin' joke
That God talks to you
There's no hope

God says have a T.V. show
God says baby do some blow
God says taxes are a sin
God says pour the money in
Rape the poor, faith no more
Faith for cash, make me laugh
Faith no more, face the whore
Rape your past, make me laugh
You might also like
God says have a swimming pool
God say keep the doghouse cool
God says planes and boats and cars
God says have an amusement park
God says go and masturbate
God says file taxes late
God says paint your face all sick
God says be a real prick

God says have a T.V. show
God says baby do some blow
God says taxes are a sin
God says pour the money in
Rape the poor, faith no more
Faith for cash, make me laugh
Faith no more, face the whore
Rape your past, make me laughEmbed
