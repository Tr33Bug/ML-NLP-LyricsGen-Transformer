Medusa Lyrics
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah

Endless curse, blood runs cold
Evil stares will turn your flesh to stone
Land of doom, world of sin all subside
Don't venture near the island where she lives
Oh, she'll suck you in
Destroyer of life, Demon
Oh, I'm ready to strike, Gorgon

Serpent's bride, the end awaits, human prey
No swords or armor shield you from your fate
Hey you, you can't escape
Wicked smile, full of lies, head of snakes
Approach her cave, but don't look in her eyes
Oh, her eyes

Destroyer of life, Demon
Oh, I'm ready to strike, Gorgon

Seize, appease, deceive, die
Seize, appease, deceive, die

Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa

Evil witch, cast her spell, seducing you
She'll take you to the very depths of hell
Oh no no (Oh)
Cannot move, no eyes to see, a statue now
For all eternity Medusa laughs at you, ha ha!
And you're her slave
You might also like
Destroyer of life, Demon
Oh, I'm ready to strike, Gorgon

Seize, appease, deceive, die
Seize, appease, deceive, die

Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa, oh, she's cold
Medusa


Endless curse, blood runs cold
Evil stares will turn your flesh to stone (Stone)
Land of doom, world of sin all subside
Don't venture near the island where she lives
Oh, she'll suck you in

Destroyer of life, Demon
Oh, I'm ready to strike, Gorgon
Oh, Medusa, she's staring at you
Medusa, with her eyes
Medusa, oh
Medusa, oh, she's cold
