N.F.B. (Dallabnikufesin) Lyrics
We fell in love at first sight
I can't explain the feelings
When I first saw you
We were so, so happy
A lifetime of love, sweet honey child
You'll always be mine

But then I played the fool
I never meant to hurt you
Or sleep with all your friends, oh
We reconciled, we found ourselves
Our love was meant to be
Oh baby, can't you see, oh

Oh, you left me standing in the mud
Crying to myself
A heart so full of pain
But we fell in love again
This time forever
True love prevails over all
She got hit by a truck
