Now Itâ€™s Dark Lyrics
In dreams I can rule your life
With me nothing's ever right
Sing for me up on a stage
Keep your mind trapped in a cage
I'm your man, I'm what you need
Dance with me, but never lead
One deep breath will set me free
Don't you fucking look at me

You know that I am
One fucking well-dressed man
Now it's dark, but I can see
Don't you fucking look at me
Now it's dark, you're gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now it's dark, Mommy
Don't you fucking look at me
A sensation of elation, intoxication
Now it's dark

A candy-coated existence
Underneath is decadence
What was hidden you have found
Made it your own battleground
Pretty, pretty, don't say please
Don't you fucking look at me

You know that I am
One fucking well-dressed man

Now it's dark, but I can see
Don't you fucking look at me
Now it's dark, you're gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now it's dark, Mommy
Don't you fucking look at me
A sensation of elation, intoxication
Now it's dark
You might also like
Ow!
Listen
I'll send you a love letter
Straight from the bottom of my heart
And you'll be fucked forever
The candy-coated clown has done his part


I'm your man, I'm what you need
Dance with me, but never lead
One deep breath will set me free
Don't you fucking look at me

You know that I am
One fucking well-dressed man

Now it's dark, but I can see
Don't you fucking look at me
Now it's dark, you're gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now it's dark, Mommy
Don't you fucking look at me
A sensation of elation, intoxication
Now it's dark
Now it's dark
Ow!
Now it's darkEmbed
