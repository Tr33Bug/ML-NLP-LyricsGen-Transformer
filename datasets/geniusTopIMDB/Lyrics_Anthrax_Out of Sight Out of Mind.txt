Out of Sight, Out of Mind Lyrics
You've got nothing to say
We can't hear you anyway
You're unconscious, wake up
Smell the coffee, catch the next bus
You don't hear it, not there
Haven't seen it anywhere
Ignorance is bliss
Before you did we exist

Don't even think about anything
Don't even think about anything
Tell me something I don't know
How'd you get this job you own
I think that
All you need is a, all you need is a
All you need is a, all you need is a face!
Out of sight, out of mind
It was yours but now it's mine
Take a riff, take a line
Out of sight, out of mind
Don't even think about anything
Out of sight, out of mind
You can't see but you're not blind

What's your purpose, in life
What the hell gives you the right to
Take what's been done, before
Change the name and make it yours, oh
Yes you made your statement
Do you have to be so blatant?
You're so conscious, image
With a gun you'd do no damage

Don't even think about anything
Don't even think about anything
Tell me something I don't know
How'd you get this job you own
I think that
All you need is a, all you need is a
All you need is a, all you need is a face!

Out of sight, out of mind
It was yours but now it's mine
Take a riff, take of line
Out of sight, out of mind
Don't even think about anything
Out of sight, out of mind
You can't see but you're not blind
Stupid, dumb, idiot, moron, you really make
Me sick

Take your head out from up your ass
Right here, right now but it won't last
No it won't

Out of sight, out of mind
It was yours but now it's mine
Take a riff, take a line
Out of sight, out of mind
Stupid, dumb, idiot, moron
Out of sight, out of mind
You can't see but you're not blind
Out of sight, out of mind
It was yours but now it's mine
Take a riff, take a line
Out of sight, out of mind
Stupid, dumb, idiot, moron
Out of sight, out of mind
You can't see but you're not blindEmbed
