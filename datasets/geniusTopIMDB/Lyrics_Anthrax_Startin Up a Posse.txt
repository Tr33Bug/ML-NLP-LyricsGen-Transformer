Startinâ€™ Up a Posse Lyrics
Now I'm gonna tell ya a story
A tale of wrong and right
And freedom is the reason
You can't take it without a fight

So now I'm startin' up a posse
(Suck my dick, suck my dick)
To come and look for you
We're gonna put a stop
To what you want to do
You fucking whores (You fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
You say our records are offensive
(You're a douche, you're a douche)
Our messages ain't right
You say "we're gonna label records
So our kids can grow up right"
You fucking whores (Let them decide)
That's all you are

Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful, land of the free
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy
(Play that thing there, Scotty)

Now I'm startin' up a posse (Fascist scum, fascist scum)
And we'll damn sure make you see
Something that offends you
May not be offensive to me
You fucking whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are
You might also like
Now you might take offense
To a word like "fuck" or "shit" (dick!)
But you fuckin' don't have the right (cunt!)
To discriminate me for saying it!
You fuckin' whores (you fuckin' whores)
That's all you are (go suck a dick, huh)

Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful, land of the free
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy

So now I'm startin' up a posse (Motherfucker, motherfucker)
To fight for freedom of choice
To fight for freedom of speech
We're gonna make you hear our voice

And now I don't do this to shock you
(That's the end, that's the end)
I don't do this for spite
You've got the choice, don't buy it, don't read it
And don't say your opinion's right
You fucking whores (You fuckin' whores)
That's all you are (Cunty, cunty, cunty, cunt)
You know you can't censor my feelings
You can't censor my thoughts
Censorship's against
Everything America stands for
You fuckin' whores (Let us decide)
That's all you are (And this ain't sexist, either)

Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful, land of the free
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy1Embed
