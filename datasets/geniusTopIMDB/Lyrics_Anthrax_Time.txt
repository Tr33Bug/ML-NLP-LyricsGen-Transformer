Time Lyrics

I got so much trouble on my mind
Paranoia time, I'm running out of life
Clockwise and the seconds tick away
Each line that cuts my face
Cut as each hand moves into place

Paranoia, amped and wired
Bile black
The thoughts that run my head
There's so much to be said
They're so much living dead
Walking corpses shambling through life
With nothing in their sight
Dance on their bones
Step in and fight

Paranoia, amped and wired

Life and death are fighting for my time
I can't seem to find the time
I want what's mine
Time through the clock
Just keeps talking
It just walks any damn place
Ohh, it feels like walking

My mind keeps thinking
Clockwise as the seconds tick away
I make my move today
You might also like
Time and life, life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isn't mine, it isn't yours
Man to man, I'll fight you for
Time and life, life and time
One day I'll get what's mine
Through persistence of time
Huh!

Life and death as words
They don't mean shit
It's what you do with them
And how you live with it
Raging like a bull inside a cage
Just give me a stage
Where this bull can rage

Paranoia, amped and wired

Life and death are fighting for my time
I can't seem to find the time
I want what's mine
Time through the clock
Just keeps talking
It just walks any damn place
Oh, it feels like walking
My mind keeps thinking
Clockwise as the seconds tick away
I make my move today

Time and life, life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isn't mine, it isn't yours
Man to man I'll fight you for
Time and life, life and time
One day I'll get what's mine
Through persistence of time

Go!


Paranoia's lost its hold on
Paranoia's lost its hold on
Paranoia's lost its hold on
Paranoia's got no hold on me
Time don't have nothing
To do with how high you can
Time don't got nothing
To do with how high you can count

Time and life, life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isn't mine, it isn't yours
Man to man I'll fight you for
Time and life, life and time
One day I'll get what's mine
Through persistence of timeEmbed
