A Change Is Gonna Come Lyrics
There's an old friend that
I once heard say
Something that touched my heart
And it began this way

I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever since
He said it's been a long time coming
But I know my change is gonna come, oh yeah

He said it's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
I might not be if I knew what was up there
Beyond the sky

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know my change is got to come, oh yeah

I went, I went to my brother
And I asked him, "Brother
Could you help me, please?"
He said, "Good sister
I'd like to but I'm not able"
And when I, when I looked around
I was right back down
Down on my bended knees, yes I was, oh

There've been times that I thought
I thought that I wouldn't last for long
But somehow, right now
I believe that I'm able, I'm able to carry on
I tell you that it's been a long
And oh, it's been an uphill journey, all the way
You might also like
But I know, I know, I know
I know my change is gonna come

Sometimes
I had to cry all night long, yes I did
Sometimes
I had to give up right, for what I knew was wrong
Yes. it's been an uphill journey
It's sure's been a long way coming, yes it has
It's been real hard, every step of the way
But I believe, I believe

This evening my change is come
Yeah, I tell you that my change is comeEmbed
