I get up out of bed, I put on my clothes
'Cause I've got bills to pay
Now it ain't easy but I don't need no help
I've got a strong will to survive
I've got a deeper love, deeper love
Deeper love inside and I call it
Pridе (A deeper love)

To make it through the day
Pride and love (Pride is) oh, respect for yourself
And that's why I'm not looking for
Handouts, charity, welfare, I don't need
Stealin', killin', not my feelin'
No backstabbin', greedy grabbin'

Deeper love, a deeper love
A deeper love inside, I, I, yeah, yeah
