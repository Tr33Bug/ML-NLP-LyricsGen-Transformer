A Rose is Still a Rose Lyrics
Listen, dear
I realise that you've been hurt, deep
Because I've been there
But regardless to who, what, why, when and where
We're all precious in his sight
And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
And now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah
When she gets nearer
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you
You might also like
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Don't believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him, your life goes on
Without him, your life goes on
And without him, your life goes on
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)2Embed
