Dr. Feelgood Lyrics
I don't want nobody, always
Sittin' around me and my man
I don't want nobody, always
Sittin' right there
Lookin' at me and that man
Be it my mother, my brother, or my sister
Would you believe, I'll get up, put on some clothes
Go out and help them find somebody for theirself if I can
Yes I will
Now, I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me every once in awhile
Yes it is
I say I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me every once in awhile
Yeah
But oh, oh, when me and that man get to lovin'
I tell you, girl, I dig you, but I just don't have time
To sit, and chit, and sit and chit-chat and smile

Don't send me no doctor
Fillin' me up with all of those pills
I got me a man named Doctor Feelgood
And oh, yeah, that man takes care of all of my pains and my ills
His name is Doctor Feelgood in the morning
And takin' care of business is really this man's game
And after one visit to Dr. Feelgood
You'll understand why Feelgood is his name

Oh! Yeah! Ooh!
Good God almighty, the man sure makes me feel real
Good!You might also like1Embed
