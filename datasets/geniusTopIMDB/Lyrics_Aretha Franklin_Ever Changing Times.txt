Ever Changing Times Lyrics
These are ever changing times

I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times

And the, ever changing time
Everything is going so much faster
It seems like I'm
Watching my life, and everything I do
Wondering if the dreams that I believed in
Can still come true
Caught in between, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day, keep forgetting what's mine
I got to find me a way, less demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives

And I, I had some big idea
So much of my life, still not completed, hopes and fears
Watching it change, into something new
Wondering it I'm going to find the answer, loving you

All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day, keep forgetting what's mine
I got to find me a way, less demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives

I see, that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see, that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
You might also like
All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day, keep forgetting what's mine
I got to find me a way, less demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together
And we're gonna be alright, together, all of our lives

I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times1Embed
