Jump To It Lyrics
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, I got to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got to go now, really
Yeah, I'm kinda in a hurry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh-huh, here's the reason why

Jump, jump, jump to it
(Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ha, shabadoodledoodweedah)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Doodoodeedoodoodeedoodoodeedoodoodeedoodoodweedah, ha, ho, ha)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(He, baby, baby)
My baby loves me
He told me that
And I never question
That point or fact
There is no fighting
Scandal or shame
Uh, he really moves me
Drives me insane

I can't talk to you now, girl, I got love to get
When my baby calls, I gotta jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls, I jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it

I just can't wait 'til
Today at four
That's when my sweet thing
Said he would call
Hey, don't keep me waiting
It's 3:59
Ring-ding, hello, baby
Oh, come please be mine

Girl, I can't talk to you now, I got love to get
When my baby calls, I gotta jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls, I jump, jump, jump to it

Jump, jump, jump to it
(I really flip and I jump, jump, jump to it, oh oh oh)

Now Kelly (Jump to it)
You know when we talk, we have a lot of fun, don't we, girl?
Dishing out the dirt on everybody
And giving each other the 4-1-1 on who drop kicked who this week
You know what I'm talking about
When my baby call, sha-dee-dee-dee-dee (Jump to it)
Ooh, oh-ho
When my baby calls, sha, wee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee
Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, uh-huh
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh...ooh...hoo...hoo...ooh...hoo...uh
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh...yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Huh
Jump, jump, jump to it
(I really flip and I jump, jump, jump to it)
Jump to it (Oh)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Ooh hoo, boy, and I jump, jump, jump to it)
Jump to it (Oh)
Jump, jump, jump to it

Jump to it (Ooh boy)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Oh, and I jump, jump, jump to it)
Jump to it (Ooh, when my baby calls)
Jump, jump, jump to itEmbed
