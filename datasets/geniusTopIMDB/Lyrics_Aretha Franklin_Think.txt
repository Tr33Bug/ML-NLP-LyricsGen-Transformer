Think Lyrics
You better think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (Think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't have been too much more than ten (Just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much high IQ to see what you're doing to me
You better think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (Think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

'Cause freedom (Freedom)
Stands for freedom (Freedom)
Oh freedom
Yeah freedom, right now
Freedom (Freedom)
Oh oh freedom (Freedom)
Give me some freedom
Oh oh freedom, right now

Yeah, think about it!
You, think about it!

There ain't nothing you could ask
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
But I was gonna change, but I'm not
If you keep doing things I don't
You might also like
You better think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Oh oh-oh-oh think (What you're tryna to do to me)
(Think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walking around everyday
Playing games and taking scores
Trying to make other people lose their minds
Well, be careful, you're goin' to lose yours

Oh, think (Think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Wooh! Think (Think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (Need me)
And I need you (Don't you know?)
Without each other
There ain't nothing neither can do

Oh yeah, think about me
(What you're tryin' do to me)
When I'm gone baby
Think about it right now
Yeah, right now
(Think about, forgiveness) Oh
(Think about, forgiveness) Yeah right now
(Think about, forgiveness)
(Think about it) Please baby, baby, baby
(Think about, forgiveness) Oh, think about baby
(Think about, forgiveness) Yeah, ooh
(Think about, forgiveness)3Embed
