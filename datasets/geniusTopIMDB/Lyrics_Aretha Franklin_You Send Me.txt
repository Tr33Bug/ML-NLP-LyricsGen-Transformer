You Send Me Lyrics
Darling you send me

Woah-Oh-Oh
You thrill me, darling you thrill me
Baby you, you thrill me
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But it lasted so long, so long
Now I find myself wanting
I want you to marry me, please take me home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You, you send me
Darling you send me
Darling you, send me
Honest you do
Honest you know ya did
Ya know, ya did
Ya know ya, do know (you-ooh-hoo send me)
You got everything it takes to wed me (you-ooh-hoo send me)
And when you do the things you do you know that send me (do-ooh-hoo send me)
Honestly, you send me
You send me, baby, you send me
You move me (do)
You groove me (do)
Whoooo, you send me
Ah yes, ah yes, ah yes, thank you to send me
Guess I'm a, a sinner

Thrill me, kill me
