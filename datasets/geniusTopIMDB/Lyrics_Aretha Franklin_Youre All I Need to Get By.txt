Youâ€™re All I Need to Get By LyricsYou're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
As long as I got you then baby you know that you got me, ohh!
Cause we got our love and some R-ah-E-S-P-E-C-T, ohh!
Like sweet morning dew I took one look at you
And it was plain to see, you where my destiny
With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride
I sacrificed for you, dedicated my life to you
I will go where you lead
I'll be right there in a time of need
And when I lose my will
You'll be right there to push me up that hill
There's no looking back for us (No there ain't baby!)
We've got our love and sho'nuff that's enough
You're all, you're all I need
You're all, you're all I need
You're all, you're all I need, baby baby, to get by
Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree and dare anybody to try and move me
Darlin' in you I've found, strength where I was torn down
I don't know what's in store, but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you, I'll inspire you a little bit higher
I know you can make a wo-man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
Cause we've, (yeah) we've got the right foundation
And with the love and determination (yes we do)
You're all, you're all I need
You're all, (Baby baby) You're all I need
You're all, you're all I need to get by
Yeah, yeah
As long as I got you then baby you know that you got me, ohh!
Cause we got our love and some R-ah-E-S-P-E-C-T, ohh!
As long as I got you then baby you know that you got me, ohh!
