Ainâ€™t Nobody Home LyricsOnce upon a time, a long long time ago, wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow
Girl, you put me through some pain and misery
And now you are standing on my doorstep, telling me how much you need me
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home

How many times I begged for you to come home, but you laughed at me and said let me alone
Through my falling tears I saw you walk away
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you, but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg
Baby, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Girl, I used to love you, placed no one else above you
Gave you everything that I own
Girl, you can't come back here
Ain't nobody home

Once upon a time, when you went on your way
But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day
But time has made some changes, turned me upside down
So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn right around

Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Girl, you hurt me once
I hear you knockin'You might also likeEmbed
