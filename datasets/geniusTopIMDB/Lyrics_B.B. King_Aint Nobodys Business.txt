Ain’t Nobody’s Business LyricsIf I attend church all day Sunday, come back home and raise
(spoken) I think I feel hur or shall I go a little further, do a little more?
Ain't nobody's bizness what I do
If one day I have ham and bacon, and the next day, ain't nothin' shakin'
No it ain't nobody's bizness what I do

Ain't Nobody's Bizness from earlies 60's

If me and my baby fuss and fight
Well, and the next minute we're all right
It ain't nobody's bizness what I do
If one day we have ham and bacon
And the next day ain't nothing shakin'
I tell you it ain't nobody's bizness what I do

Oh, I'm three, three times seven
Oh, that makes twenty-one
Ah, that ain't nobody's bizness what I do

Oh, if I attend church all day Sunday
And cabaret all day Monday
It ain't nobody's bizness what I do

If I stay out all night
Spending my money I tell you that's all right
Because it ain't nobody's bizness what I do
It ain't nobody's bizness what I doYou might also likeEmbed
