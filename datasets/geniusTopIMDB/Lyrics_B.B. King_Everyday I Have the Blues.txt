Everyday I Have the Blues Lyrics[B. B. King Chorus]
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Ooooh, everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby
Because it's you I hate to lose

Well nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well those worries and trouble darling
Babe you know I had my share
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday,  I have the blues
When you see me worryin' baby
Because it's you I hate to lose

Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Well those worries and trouble darling
Babe you know I had my shareYou might also like1Embed
