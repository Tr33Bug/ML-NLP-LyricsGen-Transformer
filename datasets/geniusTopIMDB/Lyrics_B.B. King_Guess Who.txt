Guess Who LyricsSomeone really loves you
Guess who
Someone really cares
Guess who
S'open your heart
Oh, then surely you'll see
Oh, that the someone who really cares is me
Someone will wait eternally
Someone who'll want your love
Oh so desp'rately
Open your heart
Oh, then surely you'll see
Oh, that the someone who really cares
Who really cares is meYou might also likeEmbed
