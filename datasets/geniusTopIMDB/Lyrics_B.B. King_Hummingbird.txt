Hummingbird Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get impatient but she cools me without words
And she comes so sweet and softly, my hummingbird
And have you heard that I thought my life had ended
But I find that it's just begun cause she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give, I'm talking about that hummingbird

[Chorus ]
Oh, she's little and she loves me too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
She's little and she loves me to my lucky day
Hummingbird, don't fly away
[Verse 2]
When I'm feeling wild and lonesome, she knows the words to say
And she gives me a little understanding in her special way
And I just have to say, in my life I loved a woman
Because she's more than I deserve and she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give, I'm talking about that hummingbird

[Chorus]
Oh, she's little and she loves me too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
She's little and she loves me to my lucky day
Hummingbird, don't fly away

[Verse 3]
When I'm feeling wild and lonesome, she knows the words to say
And she gives me a little understanding in her special way
And I just have to say, in my life I loved a woman
Because she's more than I deserve and she gets me where I live
I'll give all I have to give, I'm talking about that hummingbird

[Chorus]
Oh, she's little and she loves me too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
She's little and she loves me to my lucky day
Hummingbird, don't fly away

Don't fly away, away, don't fly away, away
Don't fly away, away, don't fly away, away
Don't fly away, away, don't fly away, away
Don't fly away, away
Don't fly away, away, don't fly away, away
Don't fly away, away, don't fly away, away
Don't fly away, away, don't fly away, awayEmbed
