I Need You Baby LyricsOh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Oh I need you baby
Come on back home to me
I'll make it all up to you, woman
Just you wait around and see
I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
I know I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
Yes I was young and foolish
I didn't know you was the one
Now I've settled down baby
And I know I'll treat you right
Oh I've settled down baby
And I know I'll treat you right
Yes, come on home now baby
I want you to come on home tonight
Oh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Well I need you woman
I need a good woman around
Every night about this time baby
My love comes tumbling downYou might also likeEmbed
