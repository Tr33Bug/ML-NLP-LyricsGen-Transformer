I’m Working On the Building LyricsI'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
I'll have a good time
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward
When you see me praying
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward
When you hear me singing
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward
When you hear me crying
I'm working on the building
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Well I'll never get tired
Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my reward
I'm working on the building
It's a true foundation
I'm lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Working on the building
I'm going to heaven
To get my rewardEmbed
