Iâ€™ve Got a Mind to Give Up Living LyricsI've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping
Instead
I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go
Shopping instead
To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead

When I read your letter this morning, that was in your
Place in bed
I read your letter this morning, that was in your place
In bed
And that's when I decided, that I would be better off
Dead
It read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to
Get me back
Oh, there's no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me
Back
Yes, because it's all over now, and baby you can bet on
