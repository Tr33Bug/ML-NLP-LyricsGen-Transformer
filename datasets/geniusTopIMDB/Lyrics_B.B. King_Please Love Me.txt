Please Love Me LyricsI was in love with you, baby
Honey, before I learned to call your name
I was in love with you, baby
Honey, before I learned to call your name
The way you treat me, baby
Gonna drive old me insane
You know I love you, baby
I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you, baby
I'll do anything you tell me to
Nothing in this world, baby
Honey, that I wouldn't do for you
So, if you love me, baby
Honey, I'll do everything I say
Yeah, if you love me, baby
Honey, I'll do everything I say
If you don't do what I tell you, baby
Well, I'll fall on your knees and pray
Hey, be my girlfriend, everybody
And I'm gonna be your boy
Want you to be my girlfriend, baby
Baby, I'm gonna be your boy
Gonna buy me a Cadillac car, baby
Drive me where ever you areYou might also likeEmbed
