Since I Met You Baby LyricsSince I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
And everybody tells me
That I'm not the same
I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you baby
All I need you is you
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you
In every way I can
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
For since I met you baby
All I need is you
All I need is youYou might also likeEmbed
