Sweet Little Angel LyricsI've got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
I get joy, and everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still
Oh, if my baby should quit me
I believe I would die
Oh if my baby should quit me
Lord I do believe I would die
Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason whyYou might also like1Embed
