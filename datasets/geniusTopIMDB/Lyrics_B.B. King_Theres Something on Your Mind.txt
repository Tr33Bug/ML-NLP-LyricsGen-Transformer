Thereâ€™s Something on Your Mind Lyrics[Verse 1: Etta James]
There is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind, baby
By the way you look at me
And what you're thinking brings happiness
Oh, and it brings misery

Please, please, don't try to tell me
I think I, I understand
No, no, don't try to tell me, baby
'Cause I think I, I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Well, I'll do
Baby, I'll do the best I can
[Interlude: B.B. King]
You know it hurts you when you're in love with someone and you know that someone don't love you. It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know that the someone that you're in love with is in love with your best friend. And I'll tell you, when someone else is rocking your, rocking your cradle, you know, better than you can rock your cradle yourself, then there's only one thing for you to do
You just pack your clothes, turn around, and slowly walk out of the door
Look over your left shoulder as you go out, then you hang your head and you say:

[Verse 2: B.B. King]
Oh, please don't try to tell me
Uh-huh, I think, I understand
No, no, no, no
Please don't try to tell me
Because you think, you think I understand
Oh, you want me to try
To try to forget you, baby
And I'll tell you, I'll do the best I can

[Interlude: B.B. King]
You know, after you have done all you could do and you can't take no more, then you go downtown, you get your big baseball bat and you come back on the scene where they both are still together, and then you just go and kick down the door. Now as you kick down the door you just start beating the hell of everybody that you can see, everybody that comes through the door, and just as you make up your mind that you're gonna try to forgive her, then out comes another one of your friends, and that really blows your mind. So you go and think about, you say to yourself, "Baby, I realize I've done wrong but please forgive me." And with a smirky smile on her face then she look up at you and she say:

[Verse 3: Etta James, B.B. King]
If you ever think about me
(Oh, I think about you, baby)
If you ever charge your mind
(Oh, you're staying on my mind, baby)
If you ever think about me
(Oh, I think, I think about you all the time)
And if I ever cross your mind
(You stayed on my mind)
Well, you know, you know, you know I'm yours
And I know, I know you got to be mine
(Yeah)

There is something on your mind, B
I can tell by the way you look at me
(Oh, there's something, on my mind, Miss James)
There is something on your mind
(Oh, can you tell, there's something on my mind?)
By the way you look at me
(Oh, the way I look at you, you look good to me)
And what you're thinking brings happiness
(Yes, baby)
Oh, oh, and it can bring misery
(Yes, that's right)Embed
