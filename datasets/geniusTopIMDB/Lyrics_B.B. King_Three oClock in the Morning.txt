Three o’Clock in the Morning LyricsThank you so much, we thank you

Thank you ladies and gentlemen
Right here we're going all back to the begun
All we go to the very beginnin'
Before we made this and very few people knew about, B.B. King

We go all back this time
You remind and go back one time, do you?
Sometimes you feel good go back and start all over again
Oh boy!
You show so good to me, I will tell that
That you are
Now here it is, three o'clock in the morning
Oh can't even close my eyes
Oh yes
It's three o'clock in the morning baby
Oh, I can't even close my eyes
Well, you know I can't find my baby
Keep on lookin' be satisfied

I've looked around me, people
Hey, and my baby she knows she can't be found
Looked all around me, people
Oh, my baby, she can't be found
Well, you know if I don't find my baby
People, I'm going down to the Golden Ground

That's where the fellows hang out down there
They shoot pool, you know

Goodbye, everybody
Oh, I do believe this is the end
Oh, oh, goodbye everybody
Oh I do believe that this is the end
Oh I want you to tell my baby
Oh, to forgive me for my sins

A guy feels lonely then, when you hear something like that
You can't do whatever you wanna do
Because your mind is on the person you know
You figure something you've done
You don't know what it is because she won't tell you
But every time you look at her, she just starts to crying and won't say nothing
Then you say to yourself
You might also likeIt's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Oh, yes, my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Because when you would love me, baby
Oh, a good time looked down
That wouldn't be true

I go up on my feet and I had a lot of friends
Now bad luck has hit me people
And now I'm down again
Oh, I wonder why?
Why does everything have to happen to me?
I'm blue and I'm lonesome, people
My heart is filled with misery

Once I had a lotta money
They say the greatest man until
But bad luck has hit me now
Pain has got me down
Yes, I wonder why, people
Why does everything have to happen to me?
I say I'm blue and I'm lonesome, people
My heart is filled with miseryEmbed
