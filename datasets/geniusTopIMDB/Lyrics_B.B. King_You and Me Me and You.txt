You and Me, Me and You LyricsYou took me way back in the country
You fed me on love and greens
You laid my head upon a feather bed
And I sure had some mighty sweet dreams

Don't you know we got something going on
You and me, me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me, I'll sing to you
It goes ooh -
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh -
That's the way our love song goes
Mornings come easy in the country
Never had this feeling before
Ever since you found me
Love has been around me
And I'll never be lonely no more

Don't you know we got something going on
You and me, me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me, I'll sing to you
It goes ooh -
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh -
That's the way our love song goesYou might also likeEmbed
