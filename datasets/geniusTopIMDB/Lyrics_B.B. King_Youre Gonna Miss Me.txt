Youâ€™re Gonna Miss Me LyricsLet me tell you people a low down thing or two
I just can't stand that old evil way she do
She gonna miss me, yeah, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby, when I'm dead and gone

Came home this mornin', she wouldn't let me in
She said, "Go away baby, I got too many friends"
You're gonna miss me, yeah, you're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me baby, when I'm dead and gone

Hard to love a woman when the woman don't love you
She'll treat you so low down 'n' dirty, 'till you won't know what to do
You're gonna miss me, hey, you're gonna miss me baby
You're gonna miss me woman, when I'm dead and gone
Well, bye-bye baby, I hope we meet again
You won't be so evil when you won't have too many men
You're gonna miss me baby, yeah, you're gonna miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me woman, when I'm dead and goneYou might also likeEmbed
