A Year and a Day LyricsM C for what I am, and do
The A is for Adam, and the lyrics... true
So as I pray and hope, that the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because I'm down with the three, the unstoppable three
Me and Adam and D were born to emcee
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you, recited
Arrested, bailed, but cuffed and indicted
Enter the arena as I take the center stage
The lights set low, and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd, and the Ed is Special
For I am the Bard, and I am the last one
I am the king, and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now, but vidi those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead, and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass
I drop the L when I'm skiin'
I'm smokin' and peakin'
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Can't stop the mindfuck when it's rollin' along
Can't stop the smooth running when the shit's running strong
Broke my bindings, the lion with wings
Preaching his words in the b-boy sing
I am one with myself, as I turn to thee
Prefer the dreams to the reality
I prefer my life, don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have a turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week, or for a year, or for a year and a day
Come what may...
I'm fishin' in my boat, and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors 'cause the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised, and I see myself as clear as day
And I'm going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody, somewhere, is testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages is, was, and always shall be
Check the prophetic sections of the pages
