Brass Monkey Lyrics
Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
Brass

Got this dance that's more than real
Drink Brass Monkey, here's how you feel
You put your left leg down, your right leg up
Tilt your head back, let's finish the cup
M.C.A. with the bottle, D. rocks the can
Ad-Rock gets nice with Charlie Chan
We're offered MoÃ«t, we don't mind Chivas
Wherever we go, we bring the Monkey with us
Ad-Rock drinks three, Mike D is D
Double R foots the bill most definitely
I drink Brass Monkey, and I rock well
I got a castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell
Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky Monkey
Brass

Because
'Cause I drink it anytime and any place
When it's time to get ill, I pour it on my face
Monkey tastes def when you pour it on ice
Come on, y'all, it's time to get nice
Coolin' by the lockers, getting kind of funky
Me and the crew, we're drinking Brass Monkey
This girl walked by, she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker, grabbed the spanish fly
I put it in the Monkey, mixed it in a cup
Went over to the girl, "Yo baby, what's up?"
I offered her a sip (sip), the girl, she gave me lip (lip)
It did begin, the stuff wore in, and now she's on my tip

Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
Brass
You might also like
Step up to the bar, put the girl down
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around
You take a sip, you can do it, you get right to it
We had a case in the place, and we went right through it
You got a dry martini, you thinking you're cool
I'll take your place at the bar, I smack you off your stool
I'll down a 40 dog in a single gulp
And if you got beef, you'll get beat to a pulp
Monkey and parties and reelin' and rockin'
Def-def girls-girls, all y'all jockin'
The song and dance keeping you in a trance
If you don't buy my record, I got my advance
I drink it, I think it, I see it, I be it
I love Brass Monkey but I don't give D it
We got the bottle, you got the cup
Come on, everybody, let's get ffffff--

Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie
That funky monkey
