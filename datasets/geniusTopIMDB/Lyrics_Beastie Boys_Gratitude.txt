Gratitude LyricsGood times gone and you missed them
What's gone wrong in your system?
Things they bounce, like a Spalding
What'd you think? Did you miss your calling?
It's so free, this kind of feeling
It's like life, it's so appealing
When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude, and that's right

Just one thing, do you know you
What you think? That the world owes you?
What's gonnaâ€™ set you free
Look inside and you'll see
When you've got so much to say
It's called gratitude, and that's rightYou might also like5Embed
