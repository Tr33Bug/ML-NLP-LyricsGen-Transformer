Make Some Noise Lyrics
Yeah, get up
Yeah
Uh

Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser
Back on the mic, it's the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this
The best is yet to come and, yes, believe this
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older
I'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'
I got the ball and I see the lane and
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy

Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just riffing
And when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
Cause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong

We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy
The break is crazy
Crazy-crazy

Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say, "That's my old self"
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)
The forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance
Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me8Embed
