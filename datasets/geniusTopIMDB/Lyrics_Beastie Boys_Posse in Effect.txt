Posse in Effect Lyrics
Yes, yes, y'all, (y'all), and you don't stop (stop)
Keep it on (on) and stockin' the place (yo, Yauch)

Well, I'm MCA, I got nothin' to prove
Pay attention, my intention is to bust a move (what?)
I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes (what up?)
Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes

Well, I'm Mike D, I got the deuces wild (yeah, buddy)
A list of girlies' numbers that I've dialed
I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis
I like Bullwinkle, but I don't like Brutus
Well, I'm schoolin' in the boy's room, coolin' by the locker (well)
All the girls in class knows that I'm the cool rocker (uh, yeah)
Punk in the hall, man, I shoulda, oughta hit him
Had the fresh rhymes, and the kid cold bit 'em

Smokin' in the boys room is what I do best
While you were at a party, your girlfriend fessed (Check it)
I keep a pistol in my pocket, so you better be cautious
Fly around the world, but it makes me nauseous
Mike D's day off every day of the week (ah, D)
I got to the party (keep it on) and I did the freak
I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda
You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda
I'm a Def Manhattan killer, a rhyme thriller
A mic in my hand (bust it) and a mouth full of Miller
I got a hat, not a visor, I drink Budweiser
The turntable's up on the drum riser
The needle's in the groove, and the vinyl's on the platter
I know that I'm fly, man, there's no need to flatter
I travel around the globe, it's keeping girlies dizzy
My name's Mike D, so watch me get busy, y'all

G-g-get busy, y'all
G-g-get busy, y'all
You might also like
You're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted
Dusted, rusted, mustard, 'sgusted
Cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
Mustard, mustard, mustard, mustard
You tried to steal my fresh, and you got cold busted
Busted, busted, busted, busted
Your crew's all soft, and I'm disgusted
'Sgusted, 'sgusted,  'sgusted
I'm from downtown from the city from of Manhattan
I got a lotta girlies, and not one's cattin'
My posse's in effect, and we're doin' the deuce
And we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew
Caught you poppin' that weak, and you must have been dusted
Dusted, dusted, dusted
Stuck your head in the toilet and stone-cold flushed it
Flushed it, flushed it, flushed it, flushed it
