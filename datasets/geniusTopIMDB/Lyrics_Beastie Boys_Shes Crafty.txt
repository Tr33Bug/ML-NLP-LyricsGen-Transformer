Sheâ€™s Crafty Lyrics
Well this girl came up to me, she says she's new in town
But the crew been said they seen her around
I thought they were right, but I didn't want to know
The girlie was def, and she wanted to go
I think her name is Lucy, but they all call her Loose
I think I thought I seen her on Eighth and Forty-deuce
The next thing she said was, "My place or yours?
Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!"
We got into the cab, the cab driver said
He recognized my girlie from the back of her head
He said a little something about tip to base
So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place
Should've looked back, man, I'll always regret it
Something's going on, and I'll probably never get it
She was crying like a baby, stupid dumb
It's just too bad that girl's a bum
She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, you know, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
(She's crafty)

I spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett
When I seen this girl I could never forget
Now, I like nothing better than a pretty girl's smile
And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while
The girl came up to me, she said she loved the show
I asked her to come home, and she couldn't say no
We got to the crib, and there was Adam and D
We didn't say a word, they just stared at me
I said, "I don't know her, I just met her tonight."
And Ad-Rock started hiding everything in sight
D pulled me over, said, "Hide your gold
The girl is crafty like ice is cold"
The girl is crafty, she knows all the moves
I started playing records, she knew all the grooves
He thought she was a thief, and D was right
But I just figured she'd spend the night
When I woke up late in the afternoon
She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself naked in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers
The mirror, the TV, the new guitar cord
My remote control and my old skateboard
She robbed us blind, she took all we owned
And the boys blamed me for bringing her home

She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
She's crafty
(Aw, yeah)

She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
She's crafty, she gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
