Slow Ride Lyrics

They got a committee to get me off the block
'Cause I say my rhymes loud, and I say 'em nonstop
Because being bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle, and we got thrown out
I got my boy Mike D, I got the King Adrock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy, but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud
Slow riding, gun hidin', on the go
I'm fly like an eagle, and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef, so I gave her a smack
She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand, at the microphone stand
Ay, yo, homeboy, what you drinkin', man?

I got money, I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms, I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the def behinds
I got ill, I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold, I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey

Because I'm hard hittin', always bitten, cool as hell
I got the trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
Sittin' around the house, gettin' high watchin' tube
I'm eating Colonel's chicken, drinkin' Heineken brew
I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster, I'm the king of the ave
I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have
All the fine ladies are making a fuss
But I can't pay attention 'cause I'm on that dustYou might also like2Embed
