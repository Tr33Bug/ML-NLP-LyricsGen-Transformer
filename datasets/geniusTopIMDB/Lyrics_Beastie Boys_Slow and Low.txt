Slow and Low Lyrics
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

It's never old school, all brand new
So everybody catch the bugaloo flu
Not like a fever, not like a cold
The beats are clear, the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music, first things first
First of all, get off the wall
It's time to party, so have a ball
We slowed it on down, so get the hell up
Like a volcano, I'll erupt
We got determination, bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet
So let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

I do not sing, but I make a def song
You could live your whole life, and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show, we won't get gonged
We're the Beastie Boys, not Cheech and Chong
Strong as a ox, fresh out the box
The crowd is so live, they're coming in flocks
And when we go on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock, there's nothing soft

Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

(COD) So let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
And let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

Now we not only rock the house, but we house the rock
We don't stroll, but we roll straight to the top
MCA, Ad-Rock, Mike D makes three
And we can do it like this in the place to be
When I'm recorded, you'll be rewarded
I know my song is def 'cause you all applauded
Not PCP or LSD,  just me, Mike D, in the place to be
This is not free, you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a COD

So let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
And let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo

The beat is slow in order to dance
I wanna hear "I do"s and no "I can't"s
First, move your leg and then your arm
It's not fast and nervous, this dance is calm
It's truly stable, and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable

So let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
And let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
And let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo
And let it flow, let yourself go
Slow and low, that is the tempo3Embed
