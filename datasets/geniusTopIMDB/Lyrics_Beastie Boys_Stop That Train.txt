Stop That Train LyricsIt's 4am, I've got the Hasenpfeffer Ale
I've got nothing to lose, so I'm pissing on the third rail
Groggy-eyed and fried, and I'm headed for the station
D-train ride to Coney Island vacation
This one’s… dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1-train
They'll be kicking out windows, high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstile, I lost my last token
Riding between the cars, pissing, smoking
Head for the last car, fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy, "Yo, put that crack out"
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post, Fulton Street, downtown
Same faces every day, but you don't know their names
Party people going places on the D train
{Stop that train, I wanna get on}
Check it
Trench coat, wingtip, going to work
And you'll be pullin a train like you're Captain Kirk
Pickpocket gangsters, payin' their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernhard Goetz
Overworked and underpaid, starin' at the floor
Prostitute's spandex caught in the slide doors
Now you're stuck between the stations, it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
$50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck, tortoise, your Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee, and the donuts are Dunkin
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin'
Elevated platform, I'm never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loudspeaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin El Diario
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station, to Orange Julius
I bought a hot dog - from WHO? George DrakouliasYou might also likeEmbed
