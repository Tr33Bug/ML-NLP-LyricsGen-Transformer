The Sounds of Science Lyrics
Now here we go dropping science, dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles, Isaac Newton, a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite, gettinâ€™ ova with the key
Now rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell, dispel, all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge
An emcee to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium, the radium, E.M.D. squared
Kicked out of the Palladium, 'dja think that I cared?
It's the sounds of science, the sounds of science
Science
Rope-a-Dope!
The newest in new, "Right up to your face and diss you"
Waxin' and milkin'
All of y'all square heads

Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reelin' and rockin' and rollin' B-sized D-cup
Order the Quarter Deluxe, why don'tcha wake up?
My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector
Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked, and exploded
She woke up in the morning, and her face was coated
Buddy, you study the man on the mic
D, do whatcha like (Huh)
Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well, I figured out who makes the crack, it's
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Professor of science cuz I keep droppin' it
I smell weak cuz y'all keep poppin' it
People always ask me what's the phenomenon
Yo, what's up? Yo, what's goin' on?
No one really knows what I'm talkin' about
And yeah, that's right, my name's Yauch...

Ponce De Leon, constantly on
The fountain of youth, not Robotron
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor
Cuz I'm gonna die, gonna die one day
Cuz I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
I'm goin' out first class, ain't goin' out coach
Rock my Adidas, never rock Filas
I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke the sinsemilla
Well, with my nose I knows, and with my scope I scopes
What I live I write, and that's strictly rope
I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems, formulating equations
Well, Cheech Wizard in a snow blizzard
Eat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy

Dropping science like Galileo dropped the orange3Embed
