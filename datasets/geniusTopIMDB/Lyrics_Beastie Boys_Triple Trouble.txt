Triple Trouble LyricsKickin' lyrics right through your brain
When you hear this sayin', you'll be right as rain
All right
If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you we're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed (check it out)
'Cause I'm a specializer, rhyme reviser
Ain't selling out to advertisers
What you get is what you see
And you won't see me in the advertising
See, I like to party, not drink Bacardi
'Cause I'm not looking to throw up on nobody
Known for my spiel, a wheelie one wheel
'Cause this is like having a delicious meal
And, well, moving the crowd, well, that's a must
I got some words that apply to us
And that's mesmerizing, tantalizing
Captivating, we're devastating
If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, we'll tell ya
We're triple trouble ya'll
We gotta bring you up to speed
Now check it out
Here's one for the bleachers and the upper tier
Versatile All-Temp-A-Cheer
If you wanna drink, call Mr. Belvedere
Run this rap game like a brigadier
You might also likeI got kicks on the one, seven, and eleven
Snares on the five and thirteen
Rhymes on time and that's the given
We're hot on the disco scene, check-it, check-it
Slow down with I-me, got to stop stingin'
The source of the problem is at the origin
You've got lyrics that have got me cringin'
You're like a fish-wife, quit your damn whingin'
If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you
We're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed (so check it out)
Bam! Super nature, god damn
Cerrone on the microphone, I am
Ad-Rock, aka, sharp cheddar
My rhymes are better
What the Helen of Troy is that?
Did I hear you say my rhymes is wack?
I'm beautiful, you can't touch me
If you pick a rose, well, you might just bleed
We're originators, you can't feign
Ignorance or pass the blame
'Nuff rhymes coming out the brain
'Nuff beats to drive you insane
'Nuff moves to make your neck crane
'Nuff skill to make the rhymes ingrain
'Nuff heat to leave you in flames
'Nuff style that you can't defame
You see, I walk like Jabba The Hutt
With the style so new y'all be like, What?
Turn the party out like a bon vivant
With the skill at will that I know you want
On a hot day with the iced latte
Devious like Wyle E. Coyote
Hot to trot-e or maybe not-e
'Cause little did they know there was a baby in her body
We're mesmerizing, tantalizing, captivating, and devastating
If you (if you)
Wanna know (wanna know)
The real deal about the three
Well, let me tell you
We're triple trouble ya'll
We're gonna bring you up to speed (check it out)Embed
