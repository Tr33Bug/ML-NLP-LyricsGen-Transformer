TranslationsBeyoncé - HEATED (Türkçe Çeviri)*EspañolPortuguêsहिन्दीFrançaisBeyoncé - HEATEDHEATED Lyrics
(Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Hermès on me)

Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Ivy on me
I gotta fan myself off (Fan me off)
I gotta fan myself off (Fan me off)
I gotta cool down, heated (Fan me off like hot, hot, hot)
(Like Coco Chanel, put me up in jail)
I gotta cool it down, heated (Cool it down, hot, hot, hot)
Yeah, yeah (Like stolen Chanel, put me up in jail)
(Tip, tip, tip)
It's been a lot of years, really think you gettin' one past me? (Tip, tip, tip)
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool it down, heated (Oh)
You got me heated
Heated, oh
Never met a girl with a mind like this, no, no
To give you space and timе like this, my love
Nevеr met a girl so fine like this, no, no, no, no, no
With a waist that wine like this, my love

Only a real one could tame me
Only the radio could play me (Uh)
Oh, now you wish I was complacent (Uh)
Boy, you musta mixed up our faces (Uncle, Uncle Jonny)
Oh, now you wanna have conversations (Uncle Jonny)
See, now you're testin' my patience (Uncle Jonny made my dress)
Yeah, yeah (Fan me off)

Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Chanel on me
I gotta fan myself off (Fan me off)
I gotta fan myself off (Fan me off)
I gotta cool down, heated (Fan me off like hot, hot, hot)
(Like stolen Chanel, put me up in jail)
I gotta cool it down, heated (Tip, tip, tip, tippin' on)
(Tip, tip, tip, tippin' on)
Got a lot of style, got a lot of Tiffany on me
I gotta fan myself off (Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany)
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool it down, heated (I'm hot, hot, hot)
You got me heated (Fan me off like hot, hot, hot)
Heated, oh (Like stolen Chanel, put me up in jail)
You might also like
Whole lotta reservations, whole lotta
Whole lotta textin' with no conversations (Whole lotta, lotta, lotta)
Whole lotta playin' victim and a villain at the same time
Whole lotta, huh, money, not a lot of patience
Whole lotta niggas been waitin'
They want some time on it, now I wanna flaunt it
Panty and a bra, we can get involved, boy (Wake up pretty)
If you keep playin' with my heart, boy
I'm just as petty as you are (Petty, petty, petty, petty, petty, petty)

Uh, only a real man can tame me
Only the radio could play me
Only my baby (Oh, yeah)

Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Chanel on me
I gotta fan myself off (Fan me off)
I gotta fan myself off (Fan me off)
I gotta cool down, heated (Fan me off like hot, hot, hot)
(Like Coco Chanel, put me up in jail)
I gotta cool it down, heated
Heated

Never met a girl with a mind like this, no, no
To give you the space at a time like this, my love (Oh)
Never met a girl so fine like this, no, no, no, no, no (Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot)
With a waist that wine like this (Coco Chanel, put me up jail)
Tip, tip, tip on hardwood floors
Ten, ten, ten across the board (With a waist that wine like this)
Give me face, face, face, face, yah
Your face card never declines, my God (Ooh)
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Mm, yummy, yummy, yum, make the bummy heated
Make a pretty girl talk that shitty
Whiskey 'til I'm tipsy, glitter on my kitty (Ooh)
Cool it down, down, down, my pretty
Bad, bad bitchy make the bad bitch glitchy
Fine, fine, fine-fine, fine-fine, fine, fine
Liberated, livin' like we ain't got time
Yadda, yadda, yah, yadda, yadda, yah, yah
Yadda, yadda, yadda, bom, bom, ka, ka
Blastin' on that ass, blast on that ass
Fan me quick, girl, I need my glass
Fan me off, my wrist goes click
Dimples on my hip, stretch marks on my tits
Drinkin' my water, mindin' my biz
Monday, I'm overrated, Tuesday, on my dick
Flip-flop, flippy, flip-floppin'-ass bitch
Fan me off, watch my wrist go click
Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot
Like stolen Chanel, lock me up in jail
Cuff me, please, 'cause this ain't fair
Dripped in my pearls like Coco Chanel
Uncle Jonny made my dress
That cheap Spandex, she looks a mess
Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot
Like stolen Chanel, lock me up in jail
Fingertips go tap, tap, t-tap
On my MPC, makin' disco trap
Uncle Jonny made my dress
That cheap Spandex, she looks a mess15Embed
