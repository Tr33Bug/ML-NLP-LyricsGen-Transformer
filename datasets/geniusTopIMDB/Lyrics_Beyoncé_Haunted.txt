Haunted LyricsPart I: "Ghost"
The winner is: Beyonc√© Knowles, female pop vocalist
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
And I've been driftin' off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks, man, these women gettin' solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder, "How come?"
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm lookin' off the edge, I preach my gut, it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbin' up the walls 'cause all the shit I hear is borin'
All the shit I do is borin', all these record labels borin'
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
The nine-to-five just to stay alive, the nine-to-five just to stay alive
All the people on the planet workin' nine-to-five just to stay alive, how come?
What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around
What goes up, ghost around
Ghost around

Around
Around
Around
Around (Will it be forever?)
Around (What are you gonna do?)
Around (What are you gonna do?)
Around

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh, well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm
Part II: "Haunted"

It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be hauntin' me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You might also like
You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You like it?
The bedroom's my runway
Slap me
I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm hauntin' you, you must be hauntin' me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

(Onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (Onto you, I'm onto you)
Me, me (Onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (Onto you, I'm onto you)
