Jealous Lyrics
I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you not honest
Now you got me yellin', that's because I'm jealous
If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine (Oh, I'm jealous)

Sometimes, I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never, ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this"

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Yonc√© fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy, you been hangin' out at night, tonight, I'm stayin' out 'til tomorrow
Dancin' on them tables, ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex, said, "What up," to his besties
Now we reminiscin' how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous

If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine (I'm jealous)
You might also like
Sometimes, I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never, ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no, no, no"

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for makin' good love to each other
And I love makin' you jealous, but don't judge me
And I know that I'm bein' hateful, but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine (Don't judge me)
Oh, I'm jealous
If you're keepin' your promise, I'm keepin' mine101Embed
