Miiri man ɲi!
Aa! dennin! k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!
Miiri man ɲi!
Aa! dennin! k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!
Aa! dennin! k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!
Aa! dennin! k'an bɛn sɔgɔma!

I know my enemy prey on me, so pray for me
Tick, tick, wait on it
I'm keepin' down my body count
I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah
'Cause every day above ground is a blessing
I done leveled up, now my view panoramic
None of my fears can go where I'm headed
Had to cut 'em loose, now I'm loose, break the levee, yeah
I'm 'bout to flood on 'em, flood on a sinner
The rain and thunder gon' pour
Go Mutumbo, no, no sinner
You can't dim my light
'Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
Don't make me have to remind you

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
I promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

Forever and ever
You heard that?
Forever and ever
That's the sound of the price goin' up
You might also like
Forever, and ever-ever, and ever-ever (Yeah, yeah)
At the Saxon Madiba suite (Yeah, yeah) like Mandela
Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet, like we from Lagos (My daughter)
Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels (He 'bout business)
That's a billi', a thousand milli' (Ugh)
First one to see a B out these housing buildings
I be feelin' like Prince in '84 (Ow)
Mike in '79, Biggie in '97, '94 Nas
Ali bomaye, no kumbaya
Just give me the Sommelier (I got it), I'm on La Tâche
Helmet on the jet ski, you know the vibes
Hit my head, figured out me (I love it)
Oh my God, without the God in the XY (Yeah, yeah)
I'm afraid the whole game will be colonized (Yeah, yeah)
The marathon will be televised for N.I.P. (Aww yeah)​
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace

I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Oshun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood
When we walk up in the club
I need the sirens goin' off
And when you look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I throw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
The children are our reminder

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever

Forever and ever
Ever, forever
Forever and ever
Ever and ever and ever
Time to break it down now

All praise due
My enemies still pressed
Cannot lose
'Cause I bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now, I move better, ooh
Energy pourin' out
I feel a change comin' now
Royalty in my blood from the kingdom
The more money, more problems season
But don't you let that get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
Yeah, yeah-eh-eh-eh

I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever
Forever and ever17Embed
