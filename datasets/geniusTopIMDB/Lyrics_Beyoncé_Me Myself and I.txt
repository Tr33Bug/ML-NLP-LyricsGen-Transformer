TranslationsPortuguêsMe, Myself and I Lyrics
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us, Bey
I told you that
Out on the road wit' my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There’s nothin' goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on
You got to trust me, ma

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

You're so controlling, you say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over, stop callin' me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got
You might also like
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

(I've got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
I've cried
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah-yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
Yeah-eah, hee
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-ha
Yeah, yeah

(I've got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again, oh
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I30Embed
