Rocket Lyrics
Let me sit this ass on you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me? (Watch me)
That's mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch it, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?
Ooh, grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know that you ready (Ready, ready)
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady
And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Bathe in these waterfalls, uh

I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Baby, I'll put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls
You might also like
So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Hard, rock, steady, rock
Hard, rock, steady, rock
Hard, rock, steady, rock
Hard, rock, steady

Don't you know that I give you good lovin' if you need it?
I'll give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming in my love (Your love), your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screamin' to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Deep in the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh, child, ooh, now
Yes, Lord, damn, baby
You drivin' me cray, cray
You ain't right for doin' it to me like that, daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gon' do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me, please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face? Yeah
Hell, yeah (Love me so deep)
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell, yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
Wanna rock that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddammit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin (Skin, skin, skin)
