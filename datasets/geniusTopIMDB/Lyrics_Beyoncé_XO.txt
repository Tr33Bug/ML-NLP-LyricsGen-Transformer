XO Lyrics
Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction

Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowin'
And I'm crashin' into you
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby, love me lights out
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (I search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see, I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out (X-O)
You can turn my lights out

We don't have forever
Ooh, baby, daylight's wastin'
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out
Mmm, yeah, yeah
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing, oh
Oh, baby, take me, me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (I search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see, I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out (X-O)
You can turn my lights out
You might also like
I love you like X-O (X-O)
You love me like X-O (X-O)
You kill me, boy, X-O (X-O)
You love me like X-O (X-O)
All that I see, give me everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I search through the crowd (I search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see, I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out (X-O)
You can turn my lights out134Embed
