All for Leyna Lyrics
She stood on the tracks, waving her arms
Leading me to that third rail, shock!
Quick as a wink, she changed her mind
She gave me a night, that's all it was
What will it take until I stop
Kidding myself, wasting my time?
Whoa

There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for Leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for Leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to Leyna
We laid on the beach watching the tide
She didn't tell me there were rocks
Under the waves, right off the shore
Washed up on the sand, barely alive
Wishing the undertow would stop
How can a man take anymore?
Whoa

There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for Leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for Leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to Leyna

I'm failing in school, losing my friends
Making my family lose their minds
I don't want to eat, I don't want to sleep
I only want Leyna one more time

Now, I'm in my room watching the tube
Telling myself she still may drop
Over to say she's changed her mind
So, I wait in the dark, listening for her
Instead of my old man saying
"Stop, kidding yourself, wasting your time!"
Whoa

There's nothing else I can do
'cause I'm doing it all for Leyna
I don't want anyone new
'cause I'm living it all for Leyna
There's nothing in it for you
'cause I'm giving it all to Leyna
