Captain Jack Lyrics
Saturday night, and you're still hanging around
You're tired of living in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while
Mmhmm

So you go to the Village in your
Tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies
And the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile
Mmhmm
Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling
Oh, yeah yeah

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon
But you just can't wait
For that call
Mmhmm

So you stand on the corner in your
New English clothes
And you look so polished
From your hair down to your toes
Oh, but still your finger's
Gonna pick your nose
After all
Mmhmm, yeah

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling
Ohh, oh
Oh, yeah yeah
You might also like
So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck
And your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
What for?
Mmhmm

So you got everything
Ah, but nothing's cool
They just found your father
In the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be goin' back to school
Anymore

But Captain Jack can get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling
La la la
Oh, yeah yeah

So you play your albums
And you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parkin' lot
Ohh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong?
Mmhmm
And if you can't understand
Why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style
And feed your head
Well, you're 21, and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long
Oh, oh, oh
Ohh ohh whoa yeah yeah

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Well, now Captain Jack
Will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling

Oh, Captain Jack
Will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Well, now Captain Jack
Could make you die tonight
Just a little push, and youâ€™ll be smiling

Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack
Will make you die tonight

Well, now Captain Jack
Could make you die tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling9Embed
