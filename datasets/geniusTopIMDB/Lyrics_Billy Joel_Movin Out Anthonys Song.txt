Movin’ Out (Anthony’s Song) Lyrics
Hoo-ooh
Ohh-ohh
Mmm-mmm

Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country"
Ah but workin' too hard can give you a heart attack
Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money?

And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm
Movin' out
I'm movin' out, mmm mm
Ooh-ooh, uh-huh, mmm

Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's
Down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah, and he's tradin' in his Chevy
For a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac

You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
You might also like
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
Mmm, I'm movin' out
Oh-ohh, ooh ooh, uh-huh, mmm

You should never argue
With a crazy mind-mind-mind-mind

You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money?

And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up, 'cause I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out

I'm movin' out21Embed
