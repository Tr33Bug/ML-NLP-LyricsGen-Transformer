New York State of Mind Lyrics

Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm taking a Greyhound
On the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind
(Mmh-mmh)
I've seen all the movie stars
In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies
Under the evergreens
I know what I'm needing
And I don't want to waste more time
I'm in a New York state of mind
(Mmh-mmh)

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
(Mmh-mmh, oh yeah)

It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News
(Who-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh)

It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons I left them all behind
I'm in a New York state of mind
(Mmh-mmh)

I'm just taking a Greyhound
On the Hudson River line
'Cause I'm in a, I'm in a New York
State of mind, yeah7Embed
