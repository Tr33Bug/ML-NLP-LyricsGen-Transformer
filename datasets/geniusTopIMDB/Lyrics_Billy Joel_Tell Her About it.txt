Tell Her About it Lyrics
Listen boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made

She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Oh, listen boy I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly

When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe

Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?
You might also like
Listen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes

She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

Tell her about it, tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it, before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it5Embed
