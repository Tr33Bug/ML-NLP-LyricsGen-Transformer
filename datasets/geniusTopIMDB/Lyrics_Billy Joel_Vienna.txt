Vienna Lyrics
Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart
Tell me why are you still so afraid, hmm?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day, ayy

But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna
Kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, you're doin' fine
You can't be everything you wanna be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic
On the borderline tonight, tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself
That you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right
You're right

You've got your passion
You've got your pride
But don't you know
That only fools are satisfied?
Dream on
But don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you?


Slow down, you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook
And disappear for a while
It's all right, you can afford
To lose a day or two, ooh
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you?
You might also like
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you could just get old
You're gonna
Kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
Why don't you realize
Vienna waits for you?

When will you realize
Vienna waits for you?40Embed
