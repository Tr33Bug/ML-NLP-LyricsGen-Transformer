Why Should I Worry LyricsOne minute I'm in Central Park
Then I'm down on Delancey Street
Said from the Bowery to St Marks
Heh, there's a syncopated beat
Alright
Said whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
I'm streetwise, I can improvise
Said whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
I'm street smart, I've got New York City heart
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
I may not have a dime
But I got street savoir-faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just bebop-ulation
And I got street savoir-faire
Mmm-hmm
The rhythm of the city
Boy, once you get it down
Said you can own this town
You can wear the crown
Why should I worry?
Tell me, why should I care?
Say I may not have a dime
Oh, but I got street savoir-faire
Why should I worry?
Why should I care?
It's just doo-wop-ulation
And I got street savoir-faire
You might also like
Everything goes
Everything fits

They love me at the Chelsea
They adore me at the Ritz
Why should I worry?
Why should I care? Yeah!
Even when I cross that line
I got street savoir-faire

Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Said whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hoo
Whoo-hoo-whoo-hoo-hooEmbed
