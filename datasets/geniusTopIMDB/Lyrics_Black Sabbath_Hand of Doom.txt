Hand of Doom Lyrics
What you gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now, you wait your turn
You know there's no return
Take your routine roles
You join the other fools
Turn to something new
Now, it's killing you

First, it was the bomb
Vietnam, napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in
From life, you escape
Reality's black drape
Colours in your mind
Satisfy your time
Oh, you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool, now
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you, it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think, now

You're having a good time, baby, but that won't last
Your mind's all full of things, you're living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself, don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you, stick the needle in, yeah

Now, you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see
Life's reality
Push the needle in
Face Death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin
You might also like
Head starts spinning 'round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hand starts to weave
It's too late to turn
You don't wanna learn
Price of life you cry
Now, you're gonna die17Embed
