Spiral Architect Lyrics
Sorcerers of madness selling me their time
Child of God sitting in the sun, giving peace of mind
Fictional seduction on a black-snow sky
Sadness kills the superman, even fathers cry

Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself and see
My world and know that it is good
You know that I should
Superstitious century, didnâ€™t time go slow
Separating sanity, watching children grow
Synchronated undertaker, spiral skies
Silver ships on plasmic oceans in disguise

Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories and feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should


Watching eyes of celluloid tell you how to live
Metaphoric motor-replay, give, give, give!
Laughter kissing love is showing me the way
Spiral city architect, I build, you pay

Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my earth and feel the warmth
And know that it is good
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I shouldYou might also likeEmbed
