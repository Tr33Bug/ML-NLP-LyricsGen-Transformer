Supernaut Lyrics
I wanna reach out and touch the sky
I wanna touch the sun, but I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon

I've crossed the oceans, turned every bend
I found the plastic and the golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years, it never bothered me


Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'll tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I've left it behindYou might also like5Embed
