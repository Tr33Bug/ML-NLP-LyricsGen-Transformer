The Mob Rules Lyrics
Close the city and tell the people that
Something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away

If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and
Lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun

If you listen to fools
The mob rules


You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools

Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and
Take you right back around

You're all fools
