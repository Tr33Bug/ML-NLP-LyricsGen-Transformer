Accidents Never Happen Lyrics
No I don't believe in luck
No I don't believe in circumstance no more
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
So I won't believe in luck
I saw you walking in the dark
So I slipped behind your footsteps for a while
Caught you turning round the block
Fancy meeting in a smaller world, after all

Accidents never happen, could have planned it all
Precognition in my ears
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Complications disappear
Now you love me
I, yeah, I can tell
I never lied, I never cried
And you, you knew so well
Like the Magi on the hill
I can divinate your presence from afar
And I'll follow you until
I can bring you to a perfect world

Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Accidents never happen
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
