Already Naked Lyrics
I could tell that God was in the door
November pushed us to the floor
When our last rain fades
We can still radiate

Remember all the time it took
Remember how you gave me that look
And it's not too late
And it's not too late
Are you getting dizzy?
Cause there's something in the water

Rewind, already naked
Inside, sun on the pavement
Feels like we could be dancing
Tonight, maybe a chance of
Rewind, already naked
Inside, blood on the pavement
Feels like we could be dancing
Tonight, maybe a chance of

A stylising interlude
We can't be safe, nothing to prove
But we'll be okay
In the frozen rain

The richer ups in town will see
The bed is there for you and me
I've got all this time
I've got all this time

Inside, sun on the pavement
Feels like we could be dancing
Tonight, maybe a chance of
Rewind, already naked
Inside, blood on the pavement
Feels like we could be dancing
Tonight, maybe a chance of

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Are you getting dizzy?
Cause there's something in the water

Rewind, already naked
Inside, sun on the pavement
Feels like we could be dancing
Tonight, maybe a chance of
Rewind, already naked
Inside, blood on the pavement
Feels like we could be dancing
Tonight, maybe a chance ofEmbed
