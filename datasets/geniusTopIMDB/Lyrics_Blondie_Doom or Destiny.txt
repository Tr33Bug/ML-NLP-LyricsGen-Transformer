Doom or Destiny Lyrics
Clear as a bell and an echoing shell
Clear as a pane of glass
I realize, I can't revise
As clear as a big blue sky
Through and through it all
You're trying to stall
It's clear as a crystal ball
As the facets are bold in platinum and gold
Clear as a flawless diamond
I'm hitting the wall
I know I'm gonna fall for you
Is it my fate or fatal attraction?
Could it be a fait accompli?

Oh, is it doom or destiny?
Oh, is it doom or destiny?

Dark as a winter's moonless night
Dark as a velvet cape
I realize, I can't revise
It's dark as the other side
I can recommend but I can't defend
It's dark as a deep sea trench
I was stuck in a target, having a shit fit
Dark as an angry inch

Oh, I can't wait
You're an out-of-state plate, oh
It's creepy fate or fatal attraction
Could it be a fait accompli?
You might also like
Oh, is it doom or destiny?
Oh, is it doom or destiny?

Oh, is it doom or destiny?
Oh, is it doom or destiny?
Oh, is it doom or destiny?
Oh, is it doom or destiny?
Oh, is it doom or destiny?
Oh, is it doom or destiny?
