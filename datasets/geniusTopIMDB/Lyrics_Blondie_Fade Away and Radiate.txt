Fade Away and Radiate LyricsOoo baby, I hear how you spend night time
Wrapped like candy in a blue, blue neon glow
Fade away and radiate
Fade away, radiate
Ooo baby, watchful lines
Vibrate soft in brainwave time
Silver pictures move so slow
Golden tubes faintly glow
Electric faces seem to merge
Hidden voices mock your words
Fade away, radiate
Fade away and radiate
Beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen
The beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen
Dusty frames that still arrive
Die in nineteen fifty-five
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
The beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiate
Fade away and radiateYou might also like2Embed
