Fragments Lyrics
You can't create more time, you just make it
If you want a new life, just take it
And if you wanna change the world then speak real clear
And make sure someone's listening, listening
And if you wanna break my heart then stay right here
Yeah, don't go anywhere

Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Everything comes in pieces

Do you love me yet? Fucking prove it
Try to ask yourself; are you really different?
Know that your life is more frightening than writing a song
It's an action of fractions you're passing along
And these oceans of emotion will crash once they hit the shore, I promise you
And it's the closest I will get to sincerity
The praise I make just looks so fake and cruel to me
And it's the closest I will come to purity
Simulations never follow me

Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?

My heart is made up of pieces
You might also like
Do you get it yet? Can you see through this?
You know all too well you cannot make things perfect
No, I'll be shifting through lists of these possible loves
With this pain in my brain it feels scattered like doves
Through this sky where my eyes have been drifting towards recently
And it's the closest I can be to egocentricity
This overwhelming sense of rejection will sneak up behind and tear at me
And it'll slam me to the ground into reality
And I'll deal with my disparity

Oh, do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Do you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?
Why don't you love me now?

This is where I fall down, shattered on the floor
As I'm swept along with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget
The truth, the truth, oh, the truth, the truth...
This is where I fall down, shattered on the floor
As I'm swept along with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget
The truth, the truth, oh, the truth, the truth2Embed
