Fun LyricsYou’re all over me, can’t deny it
You make the room come alive
You know the problem with you
You’re too good to be true
You’re my heart
I can’t get enough
You are the one I decided
You’re my fun
When I’m down
You pick me up again
You pick me up again
You’re my fun, too much fun
I get the feeling that you’re changing my mind
Take me back home again
I wanna make love again
Take me back home again
Ooh yeah yeah
You’re my fun
Too much fun
Isn’t fun
The deafening sound of a heartbeat
You’re smiling at me, not with your eyes
You know the problem with you
You’re too good to be true
You’re my heart
I can’t get enough
Time after time, you’re on time
I get the feeling that you’re making me blind
You're my fun
When I’m down
You pick me up again
You pick me up again
You’re my fun, too much fun
I get the feeling that you’re changing my mind
Take me back home again
I wanna make love again
Take me back home again
Ooh yeah yeah
You’re my fun
Too much fun
Isn’t fun

I get the feeling that you’re making me blind
I get the feeling that you’re making me blind
You’re my fun
When I’m down
