Heart of Glass Lyrics
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do


Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah

(Da-da-da, da-dum-da-dum-da, da-dum-da-da-da
Da-dum-da-dum-da, da-dum-da-da-da, da-dum-da-dum-da)
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah, oooh-ah-ah

Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
