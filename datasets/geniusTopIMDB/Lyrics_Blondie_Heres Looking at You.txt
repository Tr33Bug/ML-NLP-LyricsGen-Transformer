Hereâ€™s Looking at You Lyrics
As I sit staring into this liquid amber, ripples move out to the edge of the glass
Is that really your reflection in there?
I just want to jump into the warm depths and be there with you, one more time!
Oh, alright
Hit it boys

My initials sprayed across a pavement
Cut into your private interview
Talk to me now, step into my room
We'll have a word or two
If I ever had a million dollars
And if I didn't give it all to you
Would you lose interest, show me indifference?
Foot in another shoe?
Not very high heels
Not wearing sneakers too
A magazine ad, a printed canvas
A basic new shade blue suede shoe
Thought I'd like to have a little party
Thought I'd like to have a little do
Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment
Honey, here's looking at you

I'll stop my drinking, give you my promise true
Clean out the closet, be existential
And cast a vote for the president too
But for the action of the moment
Nothing does what it ought to do
Instant depression, I learned my lesson
Nothing that I'd rather do
Come on over my place, can't see him sideways
Honey, here's looking at youYou might also likeEmbed
