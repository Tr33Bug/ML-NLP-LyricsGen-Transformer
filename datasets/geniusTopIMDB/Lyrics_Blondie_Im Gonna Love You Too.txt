Iâ€™m Gonna Love You Too Lyrics
You're going to say you miss me
You're going to say you'll kiss me
You're going to say you love me
Cause I'm going to love you too
I don't care what you told me
You're going to say you'll hold me
You're going to say you love me
Cause I'm going to love you too

After all, another fella took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm going to do my best to hook you
After all is said and done
I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say you'll hold me
And you're gonna say you love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

You're gonna tell me sweet things
You're gonna make my heart sing
And I'm gonna hear bells ring
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

After all, another fella took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm going to do my best to hook you
After all is said and done

You're going to say you kiss me
You're going to say you'll miss me
You're going to say you love me
Cause I'm going to love you too
I'm going to love you too
I'm going to love you too
I'm going to love you tooYou might also like1Embed
