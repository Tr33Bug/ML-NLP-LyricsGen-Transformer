In the Flesh Lyrics
Darling, darling, darling
I can't wait to see you
Your picture ain't enough
I can't wait to touch you in the flesh (Ooh)
Darling, darling, darling (Darling)
I can't wait to hear you
Remembering your love (Ooh)
Is nothing without you in the flesh

Went walking one day on the lower East side
Met you with a girlfriend, you were so divine
She said, "Hands off this one sweetie, this boy is mine"
I couldn't resist you, I'm not deaf, dumb, and blind
Darling, darling, darling (Darling)
Now you're out of town
Those girls that you run with (Ooh)
They bring my head down
Ooh, darling (Darling) darling (Darling)
Watch out if I see you
'Cause if you say, "Hello"
It'll mean you want to see me in the flesh

Ooh, warm and soft, in the flesh
Ooh, close and hot, in the flesh
