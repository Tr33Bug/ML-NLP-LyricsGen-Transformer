Just Go Away Lyrics
Oh, don't ya know
Don't wanna see you any more
Put up or shut up
You spell, you read
D-O-O-R
You got a big mouth and I'm happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be
If you talk much louder you could get an award
From the federal communications board
Don't be cruel
Be a thing-sweet thing as a rule
Don't be sad
I left you in the street, you're pre-fab
I had to get away
Don't go away sad
Don't go pre-fab
Don't go be bad
Don't go away mad
Just go away (Go away)

Oh, don't ya know
Don't wanna see you here no more
Pack it and move it
You spell, you read O-U-T out
Don't be bad
A mad hatter's beret
Sometimes you look like you just mad an escape
Don't be mad
Or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool

Don't go away sad
Don't go pre-fab
Don't go be bad
Don't go away mad
Just go away (Go away)

Oh, don't ya know
Don't wanna see ya curse and pout
Pack it and move it
Ya spell, ya read O-U-T out
You got a big mouth and I'm happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be
Don't be mad or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool

Don't go pre-fab
Cause you been had
Don't go be sad
Don't go away mad
Just go away (Go away)
Don't go pre-fab
Cause you been had
Don't go be sad
Don't go away mad
Just go away (Go away)
Go away and stay awayEmbed
