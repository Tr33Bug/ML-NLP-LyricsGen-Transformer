Once I Had a Love (AKA The Disco Song) LyricsOnce I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin' my mind
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
In between
What I find is pleasin' and I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you, it's just no good
You teasin' like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're usin', please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruisin', yeah
Ridin' high
On love's true bluish lie
Ooh, oh
Ooh, ah
Once I had a love I thought was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behindYou might also like2Embed
