One Way or Another Lyrics

One way or another, I'm going to find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm going to win ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet you
I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya
I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around

One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya
I'll meet ya

And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hanging out

One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the hip or another, I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna trick ya, I'll trick ya
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya, trick ya, trick ya, trick ya
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
You might also like
I'll walk down the mall, stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all, find out who you call
Lead you to the supermarket checkout
Some specials and rat food, get lost in the crowd
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya10Embed
