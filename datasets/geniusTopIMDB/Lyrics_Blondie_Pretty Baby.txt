Pretty Baby Lyrics
Stars live in the evening
But the very young need the sun, uh-huh
Pretty baby, you look so heavenly
A neo-nebular from under the sun
I was forming, some say I had my chance
The boys were falling like an avalanche

Ya ya baby
La Dolce Vita is a magic dance
No-one was listening
Pretty baby, un petite ingenue
A teenage starlet, I fell in love with you
You, you with the comb
You look OK in every way every way
Ah, I should have known
You'd look at me and look away and look away - oh

Pretty baby, you look so heavenly
A neo-nebular from under the sun
Eyes that tell me incense and peppermints
Your looks are larger than life, long live innocence
Petite ingenue, I fell in love with you
Pretty baby, I fell in love with you, whoah oh
Pretty baby, oh oh
Pretty baby, whoah oh, I fell in love with youYou might also likeEmbed
