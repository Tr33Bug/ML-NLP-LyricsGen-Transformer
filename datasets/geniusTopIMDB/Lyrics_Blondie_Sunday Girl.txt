Sunday Girl Lyrics
I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Dry your eyes, Sunday Girl
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me
She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams, Sunday Girl
Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home, Sunday Girl
Ooh

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl
When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait
I got the blues, please, please
Please come see what'cha do to me
I got the blues
You might also like
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait
Hurry up, please come see what'cha do to me3Embed
