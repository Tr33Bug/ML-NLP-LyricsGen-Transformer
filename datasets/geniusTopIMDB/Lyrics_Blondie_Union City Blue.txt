Union City Blue Lyrics
Oh, oh, what are we going to do?
Union, Union, Union City blue
Tunnel to the other side
It becomes daylight
I say he's mine

Oh power, passion plays a double hand
Union, Union Union City man
Arrive, climb up four flights
To the orange side
Rearrange my mind
In turquoise Union, Union, Union City blue
Skyline, passion, Union City blue
Power, passion plays a double hand
Union, Union, Union City man
I say he's mine
I have a plan
I say he's my Union City man

Oh, oh, what are we going to do?
Union, Union, Union City blue
Oh, oh, what are we going to do?
Union, Union, Union City blue
Oh, oh, what are we going to do?
Union, Union, Union City blueYou might also like3Embed
