X Offender Lyrics
I saw you standing on the corner
You looked so big and fine
I really wanted to go out with you
So when you smiled
I laid my heart on the line

You read me my rights
And then you said
"Let's go" and nothing more
I thought of my nights
And how they were
They were filled with
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst
Then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh

We sat in the night
With my hands cuffed at my side
I look at your life and your style
I wanted nothing more

I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst
Then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh

Walking the line, you were a marksman
Told me that law, like wine, is ageless
Public defender
You had to admit
You wanted the love of a sex offender
You might also like
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst
Then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh

My vision in blue
I call you from inside my cell
And in the trial, you were there
With your badge and rubber boots

I think all the time how I'm going to
Perpetrate love with you
And when I get out, there's no doubt
I'll be sex offensive to you
Ooh-oooh
