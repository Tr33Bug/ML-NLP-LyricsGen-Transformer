Before You Accuse Me Lyrics
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
But you've been running with somebody else

I called your mama, about three or four nights ago
I called your mama, about three or four nights ago
Well your mother said, "Son don't call my daughter no more"
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Well now you say I've been running around
But you've got somebody else


Come on back home baby, try my love one more time
Come on back home baby, try my love one more time
Well now you've been gone away so long
I'm going to lose my mind

Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Oh before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Well now you say I've been buying another woman clothes
You've been taking money from somebody elseYou might also likeEmbed
