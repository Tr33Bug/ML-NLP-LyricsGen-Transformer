Bo Meets the Monster LyricsI was sittin' in my front room, I heard a loud crash
I run to the window to see what was there
Out into trouble my old apple tree
There was a one-eyed-purple-people-eater lookin' at me
He yelled, "Ooh-ooh, bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh"
I jumped in my plane and I took to the clouds
I had to go see what the mess all about-a
A-this mess my mother did not understand
All these funny lookin' people from another land
He hollered, "Ooh-ooh, bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh"
My baby standing in the do' and she was hollin' real loud
"Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley, don't leave me in this house"
I said, "Take it easy baby, you know I've got to go"
I said, "Lock all the windows and bolt all the do's"
She hollered, "Ooh-ooh-ooh, bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh"
A-when I saw their master boy, you oughta see
He was a-wiggling and a-grinnin' and a-stigglin' at me
I jumped in my plane and I made it back home
The purple-people-eaters had my baby and gone
I hollered, "Ooh-ooh, bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh"You might also likeEmbed
