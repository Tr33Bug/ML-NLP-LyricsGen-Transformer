Cadillac Lyrics
I don't want no Cadillac
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
One I got, I'm going to take it back
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Come out the house early in the morning
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Both flat tires didn't give me no warning
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Ooh, ooh, Cadillac
Looked in the trunk, there wasn't no jack
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
You know I'm gonna take this Cadillac back
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Willie and Lillie come a-walking up the street
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Doing a little wiggle, making fun of me
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Ooh, ooh, Cadillac
(Yeah)
Come to the car, but the car wouldn't start
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Cadillac is breaking my heart
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Got it started, put it into drive
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
Keys to believe in natural lies
(C.A.D.I.L.L.A.C)
(Ooh, ooh) Cadillac
(Yeah-ay)You might also likeEmbed
