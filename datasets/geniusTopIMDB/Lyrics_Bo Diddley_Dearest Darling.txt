Dearest Darling Lyrics
Dearest darling, dearest darling
Dearest darling, aey ohh

Don't you know the Lord above created you
Just for me to love
Picked you out from all the rest
Because he knew, I loved you best
Dearest darling, dearest darling
Dearest darling, take my hand, take my hand
I once had a heart so thrill and true
But now it's gone from me to you
Take care of it like I have done
For you have two hearts and I have none
Dearest oh, oh, oh, oh, darling
Dearest darling
Dearest, yeah yeah, dearest, yeah yeah
Darling, yeah yeah, darling, yeah yeah

If I get to Heaven before you do
I'll try to make a hole and pull you through

Woh, dearest, dearest
Dearest, dearest, aah

If I go to Heaven and you not there
I'm going to write your name on the Heavenly stair
If you aren't there by turn of day
Then I know baby you went the wrong way

Woh, dearest, dearest
Woh, dearest, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh oh sweet baby
O sweet babyYou might also likeEmbed
