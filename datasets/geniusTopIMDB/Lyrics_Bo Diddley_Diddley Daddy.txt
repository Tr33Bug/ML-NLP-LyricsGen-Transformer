Diddley Daddy Lyrics
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy

I got a baby that's oh so pretty
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
I found her right here in the windy city
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
Somebody kissed my baby last night
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
My pretty baby cried, you know it wasn't right
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy

My baby started to cry in vain
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
Say bo diddley, you know you're a natural born man
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
I say I love you baby with all my heart
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
Please don't never say we'll part
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)

Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy
Diddley, diddley, diddley daddy

Bo diddley, bo diddley here's our scene
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
I want to know if you do love me
(Diddley diddley dum, dum dum diddley)
