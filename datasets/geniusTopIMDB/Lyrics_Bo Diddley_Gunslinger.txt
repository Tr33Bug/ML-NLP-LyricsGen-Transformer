Gunslinger Lyrics
Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Yeh, ah-ha
Yeh, ah-ha

I've got a story I really want to tell
About Bo Diddley at the O-K corral
Now, Bo Diddley didn't stand no mess
He wore a gun on his hip and a rose on his chest
Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Yeh, ah-ha
Yeh, ah-ha

When Bo Diddley come to town
The streets get empty and the sun go down
Sheriff's standing in the doorway
You know he's so scared to say

Yeh, ah-ha
Yeh, ah-ha
Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
Bo Diddley's a gunslingerYou might also likeEmbed
