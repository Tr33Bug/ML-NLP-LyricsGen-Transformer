Hit or Miss LyricsCan't you see?
I gotta be me, yeah
Ain't nobody
Just like this
I gotta be me
Baby, hit or miss
Sittin' here
All by myself (By myself)
Trying to be
Everybody else ('Body else)
Can't you see?
I, I gotta be me (I gotta be me)
Ain't nobody
Just like this
I gotta be me
Baby, hit or miss
Look at you sittin' there
All by yourself (By yourself)
Listening to everybody saying
Be everybody else
Can't you see?
You gotta be thee (You gotta be thee)
Ain't nobody
Just like you
You gotta be you
Hit or miss
Sitting here
All by myself (By myself)
Trying to be
Everybody else ('Body else)
Can't you see?
Oh, I gotta be me, yeah (I gotta be me)
