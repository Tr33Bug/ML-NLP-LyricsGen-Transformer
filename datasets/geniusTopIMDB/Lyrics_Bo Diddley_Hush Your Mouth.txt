Hush Your Mouth Lyrics
Oh (hush your mouth!)

Hey little baby don't you cry
Mama going to drop around by and by
Hey little baby don't say a word
Mama going to whoop you about something you heard

Mama going to buy you a diamond ring
If that diamond ring's brass
Mama going to buy a looking glass
If that looking glass is broke
Mama going to buy a horse and coach
If that horse and coach turn over
Mama going to buy you a dog named Rover

Oh (hush your mouth!)

A coonskin alligator hide
Make into shoes baby, just like mine
Don't be scared to put them on your feet
Scared about me, just can't be beat

Hush your mouth!You might also likeEmbed
