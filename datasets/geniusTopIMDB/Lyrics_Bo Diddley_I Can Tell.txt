I Can Tell Lyrics
I can tell because it's plain to see
I can tell the way you look at me
The way you know you hold my hand
Yes, pretty baby I can understand

I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more
No more, no more
I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more
I asked your Mama and your Papa, too
What more can a poor man do?
Now, you been running with a heart breaker child around
Here's a new bounce that you put me down

I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more

Well, you won't answer your telephone
When I knock on your door they say that you aren't home
Your sister let me in and tell me I can wait
When you come home you show up real late

Now, I can tell, I can tell
I know you don't love me no more
No more
I said, "No more"
No more

Baby, I can give you romance
Only if you give me another chance
I'll cook your food and I'll wash your clothes
I promise will keep your warm when it get cold
You might also like
I can tell
I know you don't love me no more
No moreEmbed
