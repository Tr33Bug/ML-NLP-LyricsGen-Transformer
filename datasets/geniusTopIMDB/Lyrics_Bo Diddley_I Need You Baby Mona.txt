I Need You Baby (Mona) Lyrics
Hey Mona
Ooh Mona
Yes, yes, yeah yeah Mona
Ooh Mona

Tell you Mona what I want to do
Build a house next door to you
Get out and see you sometime
We can go kissing through the blinds
Can you come out in the front?
Listen to my heart go bumpety-bump
I need you baby, that's no lie
Without your love I would surely die

Yeah Mona
Oh Mona
Hey, oh, oh Mona
Hey Mona

Hey Mona
Oh Mona

Can you come out on the front?
Listen to my heart go bumpety-bump
I need you baby, that's no lie
Without your love I would surely dieYou might also likeEmbed
