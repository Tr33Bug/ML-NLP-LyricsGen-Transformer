Iâ€™m a Man Lyrics
Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin' in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive

Now I'm a man
Made twenty-one
You know baby
We can have a lot of fun
I'm a man
A-spelled M-A-N
Man
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh

All you pretty women
Stand in line
I can make love to you baby
In an hour's time

I'm a man
Spelled M-A-N
Man


I goin' back down
To Kansas soon
Bring back the second cousin
Little Johnny Cocheroo

I'm a man
Spelled M-A-N
Man
Ohoh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh
You might also like
The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist

I'm a man
I spell M-A-N
