Live My Life LyricsYou got to live my life all over again
You got to live my life, I live it all over again
?? I'll be a man amongst men
If I only knew what I know now
If I knew, if I know what I know now
The woman is growing with me, she can never put me down
I'm gonna buy me a ?, ride all over the world
Yea, gonna buy me a ?, ride all over the world
Well I'm gonna buy me some sweet little girl
Baby, baby, baby now
Baby, baby, baby now
You know that I love and I can never ever put you downYou might also likeEmbed
