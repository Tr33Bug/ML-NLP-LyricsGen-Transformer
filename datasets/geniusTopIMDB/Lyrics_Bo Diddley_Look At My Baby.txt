Look At My Baby LyricsLook at my baby
Standin' in the middle of the floor
Yeah, look at my baby
She standin' in the middle of the floor
She got her eyes on me
Watchin' ev'ry place I go
Look at my baby
Makin' those eyes at me
Look at my baby
Makin' those eyes at me
Sometimes I wonder
If she truly love me
Look at my baby
Sally breakin' through the crowd
Look at my baby
Tryin' to make it through the crowd
She wanna holler my name
She might holler too loud
Yeah, look out baby!
Yo' daddy's waitin' on you
Come on baby
Yo' daddy's waitin' on you
Yeah, I can see how you act, honey
That you were always bein' true
Yeah
FADES-
Look at my baby
Look at my baby
Look at my baby
