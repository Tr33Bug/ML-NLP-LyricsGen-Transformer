Love Her Madly LyricsDon't you love her madly, woo
Don't you need her badly
Don't you love her ways
Tell me what you say
Don't you love her madly
Wanna be her daddy
Don't you love her face
Don't you love her as she
Walked out the door
Like she did so many thousand times before
Don't you love her ways
Tell me what you say
Don't you love her as she
Walked out the door
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem
To be on the mark
Yeah, don't you love her
Don't you love her
As she walked out the door
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem
To be on the mark

Don't you need her badly
Don't you love her ways
Tell me what you say
Don't you love her madly
Don't you love her madly, yeah
Don't you love her madly
Don't you love her madly
Don't you love her madly
Tell me what you sayEmbed
