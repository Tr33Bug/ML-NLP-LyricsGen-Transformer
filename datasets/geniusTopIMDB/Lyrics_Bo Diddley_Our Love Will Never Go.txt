Our Love Will Never Go Lyrics
One kiss from your lips
Set my soul on fire
The touch of your hand
Drives me wild
Now, I'll know
Our love will never go

So darling, as I lay here in my bed
Dreaming and thinking
All the things you said
But now I know
Our love will never go

So give me one chance to prove my love
I'll do anything for you
Your love, I'll love
I, I, I know
Our love will never go

One kiss from your lips
Drives me wild
Sets my soul on fireYou might also likeEmbed
