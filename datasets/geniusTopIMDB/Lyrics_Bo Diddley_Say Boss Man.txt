Say, Boss Man Lyrics
A-huh-huh (a-um)

I got nineteen kids at home got to eat
Eighteen of them need shoes on their feet
Boss man can't you see?
All nineteen kids I've got to feed

Ooh-oooh-ho-oh
Ooh-hoooh-oh
Early this morning landlord knock on doors
Don't pay the rent boy you got to go
Three days, three months in arrears
Five days notice you move away from here


Worked all day any overtime
Nineteen kids drive me out of my mind


Place I used to work they went on a strike
No use trying they'll never take me back
A-huh-huh (a-um)

(A-huh-huh) a-huh-huh, move (hey) (a-um) (hey)
Never going to move (hey) (a-um) (hey)
(A-huh-huh) I got to move (a-um)
(A-huh-huh) uh-huh-huhYou might also likeEmbed
