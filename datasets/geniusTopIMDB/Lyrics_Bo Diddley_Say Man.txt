Say Man Lyrics
Say man, what's that boy?
I want to tell you about your girlfriend
What about my girl?
Well, you don't look strong enough to take the message
I'm strong enough
I might hurt your feelings
My feelings are already hurt by being here with you
Well, I was walking down the street with your girl the other day
Ah, ha
And the wind was blowing real hard
Is that right?
And the wind blew her hair into my face
Ah, ha
You know what else happened?
What happened?
The wind blew her hair into her face
Yeah?
And we went a little further, you wanna hear the rest of it?
I might as well
The wind blew her hair into the street
Okay, since you told me about my girl
I'm going to tell you about yours
I was walking down the street with your girl
Yes?
I took her home, for a drink, you know
Took her home?
Yeah, just for a drink
Oh
But that chick looked so ugly
She had to sneak up on the glass to get a drink of water
You've got the nerve to call somebody ugly
Why, you so ugly, the stork
That brought you in the world oughta be arrested
That's alright, my momma didn't have to put a sheet
On my head so sleep could slip up on me
Look a here
What's that?
Where are you from?
South America
What's that?
South America
You don't look like no South American to me
I'm still from South America
What part?
South Texas
Where are your working boots at?
I've got them on
There aren't no boots you got on, those broguettes
Hey, look a here
What's that?
I've bin trying to figure out what you is
I already figured out what you is
What's that?
You that thing I throw peanuts at
Look a here
What's that?
You should be ashamed of yourself
Why?
Calling people ugly
I didn't call you ugly
What you say?
I said you was ruined, that's all
You know something?
What?
You look like you've bin whooped with a ugly stick
Hey, I haven't got nothing to do with it but I beat the fellah, rightYou might also likeEmbed
