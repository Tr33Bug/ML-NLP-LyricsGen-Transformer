The Great Grandfather Lyrics
The great grand-pappy when the land was young
Barred his door with a wagon tongue
Oh, oh-ho-ho-ho-ho
When the times got tough and redskins smart
Said his prayers with his shotgun cocked
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
The great grand-pappy was a busy man
Cooked his grub in a frying pan
Picked his teeth with a hunting knife
He wore the same suit all of his life
Oh-oh, oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ayy, ayy, oh

Twenty-one children, came to be blessed
The old man's house in the wilderness
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Doubt his story if you can
The great grand-pappy was a busy man
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, ow, ohYou might also likeEmbed
