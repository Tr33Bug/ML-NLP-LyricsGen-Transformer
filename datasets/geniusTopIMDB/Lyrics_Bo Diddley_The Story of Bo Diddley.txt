The Story of Bo Diddley LyricsI was born one night about twelve o'clock 
I come in this world playin a gold guitar
My papa walk around stickin' out his chest 
Oh Mama, this boy, he gonna be a mess 
Now people came from miles around
Just see here my little guitar sound
Now some of 'em said I had what it takes
If I keep on practice, I'd be famous one day
Woo, I'm a myth, I'm a killa dilla
Early in the middle of the night
A car drove up with four headlights
Now man stepped out with a long cigar
He said, "Sign this line, I can make you a star"
I said, "What's in it, man? What's in it for me?"
He said, "Play you guitar, son, and wait and see"
Here I am
Girls like me
They say it's crazy
So nice
My first engagement was in Chicago
I played for some people I'd never seen before
It was good to 'em!
They liked it
How nice
Ha ha ha
