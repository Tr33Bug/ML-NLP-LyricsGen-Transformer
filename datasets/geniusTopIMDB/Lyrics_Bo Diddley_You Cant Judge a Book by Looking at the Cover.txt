You Canâ€™t Judge a Book by Looking at the Cover Lyrics
You can't judge an apple by lookin' at a tree
You can't judge honey by lookin' at the bee
You can't judge a daughter by lookin' at the mother
You can't judge a book by lookin' at the cover

Oh, can't you see
Oh, you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
Can't judge a book by lookin' at the cover, oh
Oh, come on in closer, baby
Hear what else I gotta say!
You got your radio turned down too low
Turn it up!
Ow!

You can't judge sugar by lookin' at the cane
You can't judge a woman by lookin' at her man
You can't judge a sister by lookin' at her brother
You can't judge a book by lookin' at the cover

Oh, can't you see
Oh, you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But I'm a lover
Can't judge a book by lookin' at the cover, come on
Ah, how am I doin', baby?
Yeah

You can't judge a fish by lookin' in the pond
You can't judge right from lookin' at the wrong
You can't judge one by lookin' at the other
You can't judge a book by lookin' at the cover
You might also like
Oh, can't you see
Oh, you can't judge me
Play like a farmer
But I'm a lover
Can't judge a book by lookin' at the coverEmbed
