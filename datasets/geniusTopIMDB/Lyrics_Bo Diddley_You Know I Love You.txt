You Know I Love You LyricsI'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry
Oh baby, I'm sorry
For the things I said to you
You know I love you
You know I care
With you, my new heart I want to share
Darling I need you
With all your heart and soul
To know that I want you, and I'll never let you go
But forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
For I knew not what I was sayin'
Come on little baby
Come on darling
Give me another chance
To make up on my wrong
You know that I love you
You know I'll put nobody else above you
Come on, come on
Say that you'll love me
I'm sorry
Oh yes I'm sorry
Oh I'm sorry
For the things I said t' youYou might also likeEmbed
