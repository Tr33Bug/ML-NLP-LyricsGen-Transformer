American Skin (41 Shots) Lyrics
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)

Forty-one shots and we'll take that ride
Across the bloody river to the other side
Forty-one shots cut through the night
You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule
Praying for his life
Is it a gun? Is it a knife?
Is it a wallet? This is your life
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
No secret, my friend
You can get killed just for living in your American skin

(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)

Forty-one shots, Lena gets her son ready for school
She says, "On these streets, Charles
You've got to understand the rules
If an officer stops you promise me you'll always be polite
And that you'll never ever run away
Promise Mama, you'll keep your hands in sight"

Is it a gun? Is it a knife?
Is it a wallet? This is your life
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
No secret, my friend
You get killed just for living in your American skin
You might also like
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)
(Forty-one shots)


Is it a gun? Is it a knife?
Is it in your heart? Is it in your eyes?
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)

Forty-one shots and we'll take that ride
Across this bloody river to the other side
Forty-one shots I got my boots caked in this mud
We're baptized in these waters (We're baptized in these waters)
And in each other's blood (And in each other's blood)

Is it a gun? Is it a knife?
Is it a wallet? This is your life
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
It ain't no secret (It ain't no secret)
No secret my friend
You get killed just for living in
You get killed just for living in
You get killed just for living in your American skin
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)
Forty-one shots (You get killed just for living)6Embed
