I’ll See You in My Dreams Lyrics
The road is long and seeming without end
The days go on, I remember you my friend
And though you're gone and my heart's been emptied it seems
I'll see you in my dreams

I got the old guitar here by the bed
All your favorite records and all the books that you read
And though my soul feels like it's been split at the seams
I'll see you in my dreams
I'll see you in my dreams when all our summers have come to an end
I'll see you in my dreams, we'll meet and live and laugh again
I'll see you in my dreams, yeah around the river bend
For death is not the еnd
And I'll see you in my dreams


I'll see you in my dreams when all our summеrs have come to an end
I'll see you in my dreams, we'll meet and live and laugh again
I'll see you in my dreams, yeah around the river bend
For death is not the end
And I'll see you in my dreams
See you in my dreams
See you in my dreams
Go!

And I'll see you in my dreamsYou might also likeEmbed
