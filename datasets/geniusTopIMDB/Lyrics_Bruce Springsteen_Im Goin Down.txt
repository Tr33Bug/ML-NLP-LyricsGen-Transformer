I’m Goin’ Down Lyrics
We sit in the car outside your house, you're quiet
I can feel the heat coming around
I go to put my arm around you
And you give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
Well, you let out one of your bored sighs
Well, lately when I look into your eyes

I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
We get dressed up, and we go out, baby, for the night
We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up, yeah
Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down
Down, down, down

I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down

I pull you close now, baby
But when we kiss, I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside-out
I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night, I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild, yeah
But lately, girl, you get your kicks from just driving me down
Down, down, down

I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
I'm goin' down, down, down, downYou might also like1Embed
