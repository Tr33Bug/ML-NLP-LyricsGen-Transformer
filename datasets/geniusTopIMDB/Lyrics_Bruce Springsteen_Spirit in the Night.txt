Spirit in the Night Lyrics
Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light

And they dance like spirits in the night (All night) in the night (All night)
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you
Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, "Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it"
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, "I'm hurt," she said, "Honey, let me heal it"
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can

She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (All night)
In the night (All night), oh Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night (All night), all night (All night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me


Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right
You might also like
Together we moved like spirits in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Baby don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (All night), all night (All night)
Oh, stand right up and let it shoot through you

Like a spirit in the night (All night), all night (All night)
All night (All night), all night (All night)
All night (All night), all night (All night)
All night, all night
All night1Embed
