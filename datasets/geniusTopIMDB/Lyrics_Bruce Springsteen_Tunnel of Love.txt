Tunnel of Love LyricsFat man sitting on a little stool takes the money from my hand
While his eyes take a walk all over you
Hands me the ticket, smiles and whispers good luck with her
Cuddle up, angel, cuddle up, my little dove
We'll ride down, baby, into this tunnel of love
I can feel the soft silk of your blouse
And them soft thrills in our little fun house
Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us
You, me and all that stuff we're so scared of
Gotta ride down, baby, into this tunnel of love
There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D
I’m laughing at you, you’re laughing at me
There’s a room of shadows that gets so dark, brother
It’s easy for two people to lose each other
In this tunnel of love
It ought to be easy, ought to be simple enough
Man meets a woman and they fall in love
But this house is haunted and the ride gets rough
You've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above
If you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love
Tunnel of love
Tunnel of love
