Baby Wonâ€™t You Come Out Tonight Lyrics
Oh well-a go baby, go baby, go baby go
Baby go, baby go, baby, go baby go
Baby go, baby go, baby
Won't you come out tonight

Well, baby won't you come out tonight
Underneath the moon so bright
We'll have fun cuttin' the rug
Won't cha come out my little honey bug
Oh baby, won't cha come out tonight
Well baby, the moon is so bright
And if you'll only come out, it'll be just right
We'll make all the night spots
And for you that's not a lot
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight

Oh, go baby, go baby, go-baby-go
Baby go, baby go, baby, go-baby-go
Baby go, baby go, baby
Baby go, baby go, baby go, baby go-go-go
Go! Go!

Well baby, I love you so
And I hope your answer won't be no
If you'll come out, we'll rock and roll
Come on baby, let's go
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight

Oh, go baby, go baby, go-baby-go
Baby go, baby go, baby, go-baby-go
Baby go, baby go, baby
Won't cha come out tonight
Oh, go baby, go baby, go-baby-go
Baby go, baby go, baby, go-baby-go
Baby go, baby go, baby
Won't cha come out tonightYou might also likeEmbed
