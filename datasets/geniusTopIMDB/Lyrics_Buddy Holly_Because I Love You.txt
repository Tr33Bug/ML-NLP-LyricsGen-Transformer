Because I Love You Lyrics
Well they say what you don't know won't hurt you
And I believe that it's so
So don't tell me that you found someone new
To go thru life with you

Because I love you my darling, my dearest I love you
You're the one I want nearest, may I love you
And I will bet you love me too
Oh, I'd rather die thinking you love me
Than to go on thru life without you
And you with someone new
To go thru life with you

Well, because I love you, I love you, my darling
My dearest I love you, I love you
You're the one I want nearest, may I love you, I love you

And I will bet you love me too
Oh, I'd rather die thinking you love me
Than to go on thru life without you
And you with someone new
To go thru life with youYou might also likeEmbed
