Blue Days, Black Nights Lyrics
Blue days, black nights, blue tears keep on falling
For you dear, now you're gone
Blue days, black nights, my heart keeps on calling
For you dear, and you alone

Memories of you make me sorry
I gave you reason to doubt me
But now you're gone and I am left here all alone
With blue memories, I think of you

Blue days, black nights, I didn't realize
I would miss you, the way I do
And now somehow I know I will pay
For the times I have made you blue

Memories of you make me sorry
I gave you reason to doubt me
But now you're gone and I am left here all alone
With blue memories, I think of youYou might also likeEmbed
