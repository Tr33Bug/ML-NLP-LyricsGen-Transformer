Crying, Waiting, Hoping Lyrics
Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
I just can't seem to get you off my mind
Crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
You're the one I love
And I think about you all the time

Crying, my tears keep a-falling all night long
Waiting, it feels so useless, I know it's wrong
To keep a-crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
Maybe someday soon
Things will change and you'll be mine
Crying, my tears keep a-falling all night long
Waiting, it feels so useless, I know it's wrong
To keep a-crying, waiting, hoping you'll come back
Maybe someday soon
Things will change and you'll be mineYou might also like1Embed
