Early in the Morning Lyrics
Well, you gonna miss me
Early in the morning
One of these days, oh yeah
Well, you gonna want me
Early in the morning
When I'm away

Hey hey, don't you know
Yes, you'll be sorry for the times I cried
You'll be sorry for the time you lied
Well, you gonna miss me
Early in the morning
For one of these days, oh yeah
Well, you know a rollin' stone
Don't gather no moss
And you cross your bridge
When it's time to cross
Well, you broke my heart
When you said goodbye
And now the milk is spilt
But you gonna cry

Yeah, early in the morning
You gonna know that I was right
Oh yeah, yeah
Early in the morning
When there's nobody to hold you tight
Oh, oh oh

Well, you gonna want me
And want me back
You gonna miss the best man you ever had
Yes, you gonna miss me
You gonna want me
One of this days, oh yeah
You might also like
Well, you gonna want me
I want you back
Miss the best man you ever had
Yes, you gonna want me
And you gonna miss me
For one of this days
Yeah yeah yeahEmbed
