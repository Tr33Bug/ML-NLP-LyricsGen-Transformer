Flower Of My Heart Lyrics
Do you think of me darling
While we're many miles apart
Oh please be true to me my darling
For you are the flower of my heart

Many nights I've sat alone
And I've worried over you
But I'll never worry dear
If your love is true
Please come back to me my darling
For I can't live while we're apart
Come back, come back to me my darling
For you are the flower of my heart


Many nights I've sat alone
And I've worried over you
But I'll never worry dear
If your love is true

Please come back to me my darling
For I can't live while we're apart
Come back, come back to me my darling
For you are the flower of my heartYou might also likeEmbed
