Foolâ€™s Paradise Lyrics
You took me up to heaven
When you took me in your arms
I was dazzled by your kisses
Blinded by your charms

I was lost (I was lost) in a Fool's Paradise (Fool's Paradise)
Good and lost (Good and lost) in a Fool's Paradise

When you told me that you loved me
I gave my heart to you
And I wondered if there could be
Any truth in love so new
I was lost (I was lost) in a Fool's Paradise (Fool's Paradise)
Good and lost (Good and lost) in a Fool's Paradise

The whole world was my kingdom
And your love the gem in my crown
Then I saw you glance at a new romance
And my love came tumbling down

Though you treat me kind-a coldish
And may never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish
Because I love you so

I'll still get lost (I still get lost) in a Fool's Paradise (Fool's Paradise)
Lost with you (Lost with you) in a Fool's Paradise

Though you treat me kind-a coldish
And may never let me know
That you think I'm being foolish
Because I love you so
You might also like
I'll still get lost (I still get lost) in a Fool's Paradise (Fool's Paradise)
Lost with you (Lost with you) in a Fool's Paradise
Lost with you (Lost with you) in a Fool's ParadiseEmbed
