Girl on My Mind Lyrics
Oh, girl on my mind
Please come back to me
I love you with all my heart
With you I want to be

I want you to be near me
Is that too much to ask?
Oh, girl on my mind
Please say you will be mine
You are the one and the only
You are mine to have and to love
No one could ask for more
You're mine to adore
Girl on my mind
Please say you will be mine
You are the one and the only
You are mine to have and to love
No one could ask for more
You're mine to adore
Girl on my mind
Please say you will be mineYou might also likeEmbed
