Iâ€™m Gonna Love You Too Lyrics
You're going to say you'll miss me
You're going to say you'll kiss me
Yes, you're going to say you'll love me
Because I'm going to love you too

I don't care what you told me
You're going to say you'll hold me
Yes, you're going to say you'll love me
Because I'm going to love you too
After all, another fellow took you
But I still can't overlook you
I'm going to do my best to hook you
After all is said and done

It's going to happen someday
You're going to see things my way
Yes, you're going to say you'll love me
Because I'm going to love you too
You're going to tell me sweet things
You're going to make my heart sing
Yes, you're going to hear those bells ring
Because I'm going to love you too

I'm going to love you tooYou might also like1Embed
