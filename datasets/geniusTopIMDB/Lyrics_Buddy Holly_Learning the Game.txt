Learning the Game Lyrics
Hearts that are broken and love that's untrue
These go with learning the game
When you love her and she doesn't love you
You're only learning the game

When she says that you're the only one she'll ever love
Then you find that you are not the one she's thinking of
Feeling so sad and you're all alone and blue
That's when you're learning the game
That's when you're learning the gameYou might also likeEmbed
