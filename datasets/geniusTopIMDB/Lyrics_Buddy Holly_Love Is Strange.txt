Love Is Strange Lyrics
Love (Mm-hmm), love is strange (Mm-hmm)
A lot of people (Mm-hmm), take it for a game
Once you get it (Mm-hmm), you're in an awful fix (Mm-hmm)
After you've had it (Mm-hmm) you'll never want to quit

Many people (Mm-hmm), don't understand (No-no)
They think loving (Yay-ee-yah) is money in the hand
Your sweet loving (Mm-hmm) is better than a kiss (Yay-ee-yay)
When you leave me (Mm-hmm) sweet kisses I miss
Love (Mm-hmm), love is strange (Mm-hmm)
A lot of people (Mm-hmm), take it for a game
Once you get it (Mm-hmm), you're in an awful fix (Mm-hmm)
After you've had it (Mm-hmm) you'll never want to quit

Many people (Mm-hmm), don't understand (No-no)
They think loving (Yay-ee-yah) is money in the hand
Your sweet loving (Mm-hmm) is better than a kiss (Yay-ee-yay)
When you leave me (Mm-hmm) sweet kisses I missYou might also like1Embed
