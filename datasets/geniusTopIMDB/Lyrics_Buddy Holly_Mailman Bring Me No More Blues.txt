Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues Lyrics
Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
One little letter is all I can use

She wrote me only one sad line
Told me she's no longer mine
Mr. Mailman, that'll do for some time

Cry like never before
So hard, couldn't cry no more
Shoo-shoo mailman, stay away from my door
Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
One little letter is all I can useYou might also likeEmbed
