Oh, Boy! Lyrics
All of my love
All of my kissing
You don't know what you've been a-missing
Oh boy (Oh boy), when you're with me
Oh boy (Oh boy), the world can see
That you, were meant, for me

All of my life
I've been a-waiting
Tonight there'll be no, hesitating
Oh boy (oh boy), when you're with me
Oh boy (oh boy), the world can see
That you, were meant, for me
Stars appear and shadows are falling
You can hear my heart a-calling
A little bit a-loving makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight
All of my love
All of my kissing
You don't know what you've been a-missing
Oh boy (Oh boy), when you're with me
Oh boy (Oh boy), the world can see
That you, were meant, for me

Dum-dee-dum-dum
Oh boy
Dum-dee-dum-dum
Oh boy
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh

All of my love
All of my kissing
You don't know what you've been a-missing
Oh boy (Oh boy), when you're with me
Oh boy (Oh boy), the world can see
That you, were meant, for me

All of my life
I've been a-waiting
Tonight there'll be no, hesitating
Oh boy (Oh boy), when you're with me
Oh boy (Oh boy), the world can see
That you, were meant, for me
Stars appear and shadows are falling
You can hear my heart a-calling
A little bit a-loving makes everything right
I'm going to see my baby tonight
You might also like
All of my love
All of my kissing
You don't know what you've been a-missing
Oh boy (Oh boy), when you're with me
Oh boy (Oh boy), the world can see
That you, were meant, for me3Embed
