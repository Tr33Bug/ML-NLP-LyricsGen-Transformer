Ready Teddy Lyrics
Ready - set - go man go
I got a gal that I love so

I'm ready - ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready ready to rock and roll

Going down to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock and roll baby, she's the apple of my eye

Well, the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping, the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style


Going to kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock and roll baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Going to rock and roll until the early early night
