Rock Around With Ollie Vee LyricsWo-hell, we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues tonight
Rock, 'cause everything gonna be alright
'cause tonight we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues
Well, I got a little gal called Ollie Vee
Ollie Vee comes from Memphis, Memphis Tennessee
And tonight we're gonna rock-a-rock around with Ollie Vee
Ollie, Ollie Vee
Ollie Vee says she's gonna do me right tonight
I'm going to wear my blue suede shoes tonight
And tonight we're gonna rock-a-rock around with Ollie Vee
Ollie, Ollie Vee
Well, we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues tonight
Rock, 'cause everything gonna be alright
'cause tonight we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues
Go!

Wo-hell, we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues tonight
Rock, 'cause everything gonna be alright
'cause tonight we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues
I'm going to shout, laugh, holler and giggle tonight
I'm going to shake it just a little in the middle of the night
'Cause tonight we're gonna rock-a-rock around with Ollie Vee
Ollie, Ollie Vee
Well hey Mister cop look out tonight
If you try to put a stop to me tonight
'Cause tonight we're gonna rock-a-rock around with Ollie Vee
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie
Wo-hell, we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues tonight
Rock, 'cause everything gonna be alright
'cause tonight we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues
Wo-hell, we're gonna rock to the rhythm and the blues tonight
Rock, 'cause everything gonna be alright
