Slippin’ And Slidin’ Lyrics
Slipping and a-sliding, peeping and a-hiding
Been told a long time ago
Slipping and a-sliding, peeping and a-hiding
Been told a long time ago
I've been told, baby, you've been bold
I won't be your fool no more

Oh, big conniver, nothing but a jive
I done got hip to your jive
Oh, big conniver, nothing but a jive
Done got hip to your jive
Slipping and a-sliding, peeping and a-hiding
And I won't a-be your fool no more

Oh, my Linda, she's a solid sender
You know you better surrender
Oh, my Linda, she's a solid sender
You know you better surrender
Slipping and sliding, peeping and hiding
And I won't be your fool no more

Slipping and a-sliding, peeping and a-hiding
Been told a long time ago
Slipping and a-sliding, peeping and a-hiding
Been told a long time ago
I've been told, baby, you've been bold
I won't be your fool no moreYou might also likeEmbed
