Take Your Time LyricsTake your time, I can wait
For all the love I know will be mine
If you take your time
Take your time, though its late
Heart strings will sing like a string of twine
If you take your time
Take your time and take mine too
I have time to spend
Take your time go with me through
Times 'till all times end
Take your time, I can wait
For all the love I know will be mine
