Umm Oh Yeah (Dearest) LyricsDearest - though you're the nearest to my heart
Please don't ever - umm yeah
Ever say we'll part
You scold and you were so bold
Years together - umm yeah
Our love will grow old - umm yeah
Our love will grow old
You may be a million miles away
Please believe me - umm yeah
When you hear me say
I love you - I love you
Come home - keep me from these sleepless nights
Try my love again - umm yeah
I'm gonna treat you right - umm yeah
I'm gonna treat you rightYou might also likeEmbed
