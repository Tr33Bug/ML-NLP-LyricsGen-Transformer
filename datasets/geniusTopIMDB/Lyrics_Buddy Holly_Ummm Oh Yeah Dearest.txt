Ummm, Oh Yeah (Dearest) Lyrics
Dearest, though you're the nearest to my heart
Please don't ever (Ummm yeah) ever say we'll part
You scold, and you are so bold
Yes together (Ummm yeah) our love will grow old
(Ummm yeah) Our love will grow old

You may be a million miles away
Please believe me (Ummm yeah) when you hear me say
I love you, I love you
Come home, keep me from these sleepless nights
Try my love again (Ummm yeah)
I'm going to treat you right (Ummm yeah)
I'm going to treat you rightYou might also like1Embed
