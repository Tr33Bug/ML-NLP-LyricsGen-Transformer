You And I Are Through Lyrics
You said that you were leaving me
You were going to let me be
But now I find you here
I loved you, but don't you love me too?
But you said I'd never do
Now you and I are through
I loved you then my darling I loved you every day
But it seems my darling your love just fades away

You loved me but I just don't care
About the new love that I'll share
And you and I are through


I loved you then my darling I loved you every day
But it seems my darling your love just fades away
