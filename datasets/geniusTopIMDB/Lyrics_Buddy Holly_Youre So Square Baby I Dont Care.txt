(You’re So Square) Baby I Don’t Care Lyrics
You don't like crazy music
You don't like rocking bands
You just want to go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands

You're so square
Baby I don't care

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that I do
I only know I love you like I do
I do, I do

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because

Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
