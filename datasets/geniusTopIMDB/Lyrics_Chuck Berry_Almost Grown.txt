Almost Grown Lyrics
You know I'm almost grown

Yeah and I'm doing all right in school
They ain't said I broke no rule
I ain't never been in Dutch
I don't carouse around too much
Don't bother me, leave me alone
Anyway I'm almost grown
I don't run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
I'm going to buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park
Don't bother us, leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown

Got my eye on a little girl
Ah, she's really out of this world
Now I take her to a dance
We started talkin' about romance
Don't bother us, leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown


You know I'm still living in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I don't browse around at all
Don't bother us, leave us alone
Anyway we almost grownYou might also like1Embed
