Back in the U.S.A. LyricsOh well, oh well, I feel so good today
We just touched ground on an international runway
Jet propelled back home, from over seas to the U.S.A
New York, Los Angeles, oh how I yearned for you
Detroit, Chicago, Chattanooga, Baton Rouge
Let alone just to be at my home back in old St. Lou
Did I miss the skyscrapers, did I miss the long freeway?
From the coast of California to the shores of The Delaware Bay
You can bet your life I did, till I got back in the U.S.A
Looking hard for a drive-in, searching for a corner cafe
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day
Yeah, and a jukebox jumping the records like in the U.S.A
Well, I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A
Yes I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A
Anything you want, we got it right here in the U.S.A
I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.A
Yes I'm so glad I'm livin' in the U.S.AYou might also likeEmbed
