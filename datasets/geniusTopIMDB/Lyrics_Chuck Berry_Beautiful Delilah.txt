Beautiful Delilah Lyrics
Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look from fellas passing by
Every time you see her she's with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why

Rebecka don't allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantalizing
You just can't be true
Beautiful Delilah, dressed in the latest style
Swinging like a pendulum, walking down the aisle
Deep romantic eyes, speak so low in miles
Maybe she will settle down and marry after a while

Rebecka don't allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantalizing
You just can't be true

Beautiful Delilah, bathing in the sun
An audience of 17, and notice not a one
Local casanova who wouldn't be outdone
Let her steal his heart away, and break it just for fun

Rebecka don't allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantalizing
You just can't be trueYou might also likeEmbed
