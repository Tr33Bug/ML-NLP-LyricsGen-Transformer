Big Boys Lyrics
When I was just a little boy like you
I wanted to do things the big boys do
Wherever they went you knew they wouldn't let me go
And I got suspicious and I wanted to know
I was bright in school but my future looked dim
'Cause the big boys wouldn't let me party with them

Yes, yes
I didn't cry
Yes, yes
And you know why
Yes, yes
I knew when and what
Yes, yes
No ifs, ands, or buts
I was looking for joy
Yes, yes, yes, yes
When I was little bitty boy
All of the big girls with their to
When I ask 'em what's happening, nobody knew
But when I found out where, what, when, and why
I didn't let a single week pass by
Till the school dance when I first met you
And I learned to party like the big boys do

Yes, yes
I didn't cry
Yes, yes
And you know why
Yes, yes
I knew when and what
Yes, yes
No ifs, ands, or buts
I was looking for joy
Yes, yes, yes, yes
When I was little bitty boy

If I would have known what makes a world go 'round
I would have known what goes up must come down
If you love me like I love you
Mademoiselle, je vous aime, voulez-vous?
The girls want to stay and the boys want to play
So let's a-rock and roll till the break of day
You might also like
Yes, yes
I didn't cry
Yes, yes
And you know why
Yes, yes
I knew when and what
Yes, yes
No ifs, ands, or buts
I was looking for joy
Yes, yes, yes, yes
When I was little bitty boy1Embed
