Brown Eyed Handsome Man Lyrics
Arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sittin' in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
She said "Free that brown-eyed man
If you want your job you'd better free that brown eyed man"

Flyin' across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walkin' 'cross the sand
She been walkin' 30 miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown-eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown-eyed handsome man
Way back in history, 3000 years
In fact, ever since the world began
There's been a whole lotta good women sheddin' tears
Over a brown-eyed handsome man
It's a lot of trouble for the brown-eyed handsome man


Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her, "Darling, go out and find
Yourself a brown-eyed handsome man
Just like your daddy, he's a brown-eyed handsome man"

Marlo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To meet a brown-eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown-eyed handsome man

Two-three the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Roundin' third, he was headed for home
It was a brown-eyed handsome man
That won the game, it was a brown-eyed handsome manYou might also likeEmbed
