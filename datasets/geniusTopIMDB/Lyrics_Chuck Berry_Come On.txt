Come On Lyrics
Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted
All day long I'm walking 'cause I couldn't get my car started
Laid off from my job and I can't afford to check it
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it

Come on, since my baby parted, come on
I can't get started, come on
I can't afford to check it
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it
Everything is wrong since I been without you
Every night I lay awake thinking about you
Every time the phone rings sounds like thunder
Some stupid jerk trying to reach another number

Come on, since I been without you, come on
Steady thinking about you, come on
Phone sounds like thunder
Some stupid jerk trying to reach another number


Everything is wrong since I last saw you baby
I really want to see you and I don't mean maybe
I'm doing everything trying to make you see
That I belong to you honey and you belong to me

So come on, I want to see you baby, come on
I don't mean maybe, come on
I'm trying to make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me

Come on
Tell me something baby, come on1Embed
