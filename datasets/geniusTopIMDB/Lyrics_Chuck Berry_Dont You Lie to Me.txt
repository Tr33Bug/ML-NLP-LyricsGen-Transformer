Donâ€™t You Lie to Me Lyrics
Let's talk it over, baby, 'fore we start
I heard about the way that you overdo your part
Don't lie to me, don't you lie to me
'Cause it makes me mad and I get shook up as a man can be

There's two kind of people that I just can't stand
And that's a lying woman and a cheating man
Don't lie to me, don't you lie to me
'Cause it makes me mad and I get shook up as a man can be
I can love you, baby, till the cows come home
But I'm so sick and tired of you treating me wrong
Don't lie to me, don't you lie to me
'Cause it makes me mad and I get evil as a man can be


If you love me, baby, and it ain't no lie
Well I'll be with you, baby, till the river run dry
Don't lie to me, don't you lie to me
'Cause it makes me mad and I get evil as a man can beYou might also like1Embed
