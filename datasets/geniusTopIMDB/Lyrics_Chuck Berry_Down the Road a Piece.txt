Down the Road a Piece Lyrics
Now if you want to hear some boogie like I'm going to play
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer man's a cat they call Kicking McCoy
I know you remember that rubber-legged boy
Mama's cooking chicken fried and bacon grease
Come on along boys, it's just down the road apiece

Now there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night from about twelve to six
And if you want to get some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting to you like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road apiece

Now there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night from about twelve to six
And if you want to get some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting to you like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road apieceYou might also likeEmbed
