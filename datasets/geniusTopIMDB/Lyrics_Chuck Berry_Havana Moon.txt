Havana Moon Lyrics
Havana moon
Havana moon

Me all alone with jug of rum
Me stand and wait for boat to come
Is long the night, is quiet the dark
The boat she late since twelve o'clock
Me watch the tide easing in
Is low the moon but high the wind
Havana moon
Havana moon

Me all alone, me open the rum
Is long the wait for boat to come
American girl come back to me
We'll sail away across the sea
We'll dock in New York, the buildings high
We find a home up in the sky

Havana moon
Havana moon

Me still alone, me sip on the rum
Me wonder when the boat she come
To bring me love, oh sweet little thing
She rock and roll, she dance and sing
She hold me tight, she touch me lips
Me eyes they close, me heart she flip

Havana moon
Havana moon
You might also like
But still alone me drinking the rum
Begin to think the boat no come
American girl she tell a lie
She say, "Till then"
She mean, "Goodbye"

Havana moon
Havana moon

Me lay down alone, was good the rum
Me fall asleep, the boat she come
The girl she look till come the dawn
She weep and cry and return for home
The whistle blow, me open me eyes
Was bright the sun, was blue the skies
Me grab me shoes, me jump and run
Me see the boat head for horizon
Havana moon, is gone the rum
The boat she sail, me love she gone

Havana moon
