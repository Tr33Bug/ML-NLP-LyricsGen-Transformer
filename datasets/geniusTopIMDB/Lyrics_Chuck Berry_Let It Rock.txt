Let It Rock Lyrics
In the heat of the day
Down In mobile Alabama
Working on the railroad
With the steel-driving hammer
I gotta make some money
To buy some brand new shoes
Tryin' to find somebody
To take away these blues
"She don't love me"
Hear them singing in the sun
Payday's coming when my work is all done
Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up your belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles out

Everybody's scrambling n' 'jumping around
Picking up their money
Tearing the teepee down
Foreman wants to panic
'Bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blows the whistle long and long
Can't stop the train
You have to let it roll onYou might also likeEmbed
