No Money Down Lyrics
As I was motivating back in town
I saw a Cadillac sign saying 'No Money Down'
So I eased on my brakes and I pulled in the drive
Gunned my motor twice then I walked inside
Dealer came to me said "Trade in your Ford
And I'll put you in a car that'll eat up the road
Just tell me what you want and then sign that line
And I'll have it brought down to you in a hour's time"

I'm going to get me a car
And I'll be headed on down the road
Then I won't have to worry
About that broken down, ragged Ford
Well Mister I want a yellow convertible four door De Ville
With a Continental spare and a wire chrome wheel
I want power steering and power brakes
I want a powerful motor with a jet off-take
I want air condition, I want automatic heat
And I want a full Murphy bed in my back seat
I want short-wave radio, I want TV and a phone
You know I got to talk to my baby when I'm riding alone

Yes I'm going to get that car
And I'm going to head on down the road
Yeah, then I won't have to worry
About that broken down, ragged Ford

I want four carburetors and two straight exhausts
I'm burning aviation fuel no matter what the cost
I want railroad air horns and a military spot
And I want a five year guarantee on everything I got
I want ten dollar deductible I want twenty dollar notes
I want thirty thousand liability that's all she wrote

I got me a car
And I'm headed on down the road
No money down I don't have to worry
About that broken down, ragged FordYou might also likeEmbed
