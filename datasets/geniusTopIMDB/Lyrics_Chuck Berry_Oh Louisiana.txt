Oh Louisiana Lyrics
Oh, Louisiana, I stayed away from you too long
Oh, Louisiana, how can a true love go so wrong?
She put me in shame and in sorrow, and I come home tomorrow
Oh, Louisiana

Oh, Louisiana, yeah, yeah, Creole baby, Cajun queens
Quaint porches and windows, filet de gumbo, the Basin beans
Your beautiful Delta, and bayous in greens
Oh, Louisiana
Oh, Louisiana, yea-e-e, yeah, I'm flying on Delta Nine-o-three
Right over St. Louis, high over Memphis, Tennessee
On southward to the sea, where I long to be
Oh, Louisiana

Oh, Louisiana, yeah, yeah, them Yankee nights are cold and long
Oh, Louisiana, she broke my heart and wrecked my home
She shamed me in sorrow, to face my tomorrow
Oh, take me back, oh, Louisiana
Mmm, mmm, Louisiana
