Reelin’ and Rockin’ Lyrics
Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't
Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't
Sometimes I do, then again I think I don't

Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:21
We was at a rock'n'roll dance having nothing but fun
And we rolled, reelin' and a rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:32
There's nothing I'd rather do than dance with you
And we rolled, reelin' and a rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn

Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:43
And everytime I spinned she spinned with me
And we reeled, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn

Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:54
I said, "Dance ballerina girl, go go go!"
And we rolled, reelin' and a - rockin'
We was reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn

Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:05
Man, I didn't know if I was dead or alive
And I was rollin', reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn

Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:26
But I'm gonna keep on dancing toll I get my kicks
And we reeled, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn

Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:28
I gotta get my kicks before it get too late
And we reeled, reelin' and rockin'
We was reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn

Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:29
I had to hold her hand, she was still holding mine
As we reeled, reelin' and a rockin'
We was reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn

Well I looked at my watch and to my surprise
I was dancing with a woman that was twice my size
I was reelin', reelin' and rockin'
I was reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch and it was time to go
The bandleader said "We ain't playing no more"
And we was reelin', reelin' and a rockin'
We was reelin' and a rockin'
Rollin' 'til the break of dawnEmbed
