School Day (Ring Ring Goes The Bell) Lyrics
Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You study 'em hard and hopin' to pass
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring, ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom, open your books
Gee but the teacher don't know how mean she looks
Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long, you been wanting to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
'Round and 'round and 'round you go


Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long, you been wanting to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
You might also like
Hail, hail rock'n'roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock'n'roll
The beat of the drum is loud and bold
Rock rock rock'n'roll
The feelin' is there body and soulEmbed
