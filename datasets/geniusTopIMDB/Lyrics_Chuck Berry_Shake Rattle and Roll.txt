Shake, Rattle and Roll Lyrics
Get up out of that bed and wash your face and hands
Get on in that kitchen, make some noise with them pots and pans
A-get to cookin' my breakfast 'cause you know I'm a working man
You ain't been wearin' no bra, you just lettin' 'em boogie joogie bow
You keep on wearin' short dresses with the hem halfway your thigh
And I could see your little bikini bathing suit when the wind is high

Well, come on and now shake it, rattle it, and roll it
I said shake it, rattle it, and roll it
I said shake it, rattle it, and roll it
Come on, shake it, rattle it, and roll it
You won't do nothing right if even meant to save your doggone soul

Child, I'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
I've been watching you sneaking out, creeping in that back door
I can tell the way you're acting I believe you been around this whore
I believe you're doing me wrong and now I know
The bigger money I make, the more you wanna spend my dough
You better get yourself together or I ain't gonna love you no more

Come on baby now shake it, rattle it, and roll it
I said shake it, rattle it, and roll it
I said shake it, rattle it, and roll it
Come on, shake it, rattle it, and roll it
You won't do nothing right if even meant to save your doggone soulYou might also likeEmbed
