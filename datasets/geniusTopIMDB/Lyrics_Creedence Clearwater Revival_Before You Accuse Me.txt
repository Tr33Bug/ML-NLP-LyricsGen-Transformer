Before You Accuse Me Lyrics
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been buying other women clothes
But you've been talking to someone else

I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Your mama said, "Son
Don't call my daughter no more"
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been buying other women clothes
But you've been taking money from someone else

Come on back home, baby, try my love one more time
Come on back home, baby, try my love one more time
You've been gone away so long
I'm just about to lose my mind

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been buying other women clothes
But you've been talking to someone elseYou might also likeEmbed
