Bootleg Lyrics
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl

Take you a glass of water
Make it against the law
See how good the water tastes
When you can't have any at all
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl

Finding a natural woman
Like honey to a bee
But you don't buzz the flower
When you know the honey's free

Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl


Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie
But Lord, that ain't no fun
Better you grab it when she ain't looking
Because you know you'd rather have it on the run
You might also like
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howl
Bootleg, bootleg
Bootleg, howlEmbed
