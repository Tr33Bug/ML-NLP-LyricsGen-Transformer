Effigy Lyrics
Last night
I saw a fire burning on
The palace lawn
O'er the land
The humble subjects watched in mixed
Emotion

Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The palace door
Silent majority
Weren't keeping quiet
Anymore

Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy

Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The country side
In the morning
Few were left to watch
The ashes die

Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
Who is burning?
Who is burning?
Effigy
