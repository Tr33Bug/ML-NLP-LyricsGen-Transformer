Feelinâ€™ Blue Lyrics
Hey, look over yonder out in the rain
Soaking wet fever in my brain
Now, I ain't certain which way to go
But I got to move, sure

Feeling blue, blue, blue, blue, blue 
I'm feeling blue. I'm feeling blue

Hey, look over yonder behind the wall
They're closing in I'm about to fall
Now I'm no coward, but I ain't no fool
Feel it in my bones, my book is due

Hey, look over yonder, up in the tree
There's a rope hanging just for me
Without a warning, without a warning
Things are piling up to break me down

Hey, look over yonder, out in the street
People laughing by, walking easy
Now, I'm no sinner, but I ain't no saint
If it's happy, you can say I ain't
