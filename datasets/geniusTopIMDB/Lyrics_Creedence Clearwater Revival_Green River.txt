Green River Lyrics
Well, take me back down where cool water flow, yâ€™all
Let me remember things I love, Lord
Stoppin' at the log where catfish bite
Walkin' along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin' in the moonlight

I can hear the bullfrog callin' me, aw
Wonder if my rope's still hangin' to the tree, aw
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water
Shoo fly, dragon fly, get back to mother
Pick up a flat rock, skip it across Green River
Well

Up at Cody's camp I spent my days, Lord
With flat car riders and cross-tie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said, "You're gonna find the world is smolderin'
And if you get lost, come on home to Green River"
Well
Come on homeYou might also like6Embed
