I Put a Spell on You Lyrics
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The things that you're doing
I said "watch out!
I ain't lying, yeah!
I ain't gonna take none of your
Fooling around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
All right!

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The things that you're doing
I said "watch out!
I ain't lying, yeah!
I ain't gonna take none of your
Fooling around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
All right and I took it down!You might also like9Embed
