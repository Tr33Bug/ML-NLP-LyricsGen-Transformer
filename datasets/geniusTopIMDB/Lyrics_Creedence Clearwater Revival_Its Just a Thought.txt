Itâ€™s Just a Thought Lyrics
It's just a thought
But I've noticed something strange
Getting harder to explain
All the years are passing by and by
Still I don't know what makes it go
Who said to wait and you'll see?
It's just a thought
But I wondered if you knew
That the song up there is you
They can't take it from you
If you don't give it away
Don't give it away; Ooh (It's given away)
It's just a thought
But the word has come too late
That a bad idea will take
Just about a lifetime to explain
And don't you see
Good one's going to be much longer
Who's going to wait, just to see?You might also likeEmbed
