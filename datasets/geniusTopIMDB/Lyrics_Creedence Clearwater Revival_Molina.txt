Molina Lyrics
Molina, where you going to? 

She's daughter to the mayor
Messing with the sheriff
Driving in a blue car
She don't see no red light

She's coming in the morning
Looking a disaster
Driving in the prowl car
Spent the night in jail


Sheriff going to go far
Driving to the state house
If she makes a million
Papa can retire
