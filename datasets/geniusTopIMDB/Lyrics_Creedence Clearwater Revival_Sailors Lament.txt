Sailorâ€™s Lament Lyrics
Woke up early feeling light (Shame, it's a shame)
Somebody got to me last night (Shame, it's a shame)
Sat down for a friendly duel (Shame, it's a shame)
With one-eyed jacks and jokers, too (Shame, it's a shame)

Ooh, sailor man (Shame, it's a shame) 

Poormouth Henry turned on me (Shame, it's a shame)
Said, "Boy, I'm going to pick you clean." (Shame, it's a shame)

Oh!

Henry said, "Don't you mess that pile" (Shame, it's a shame)
Had three aces and he had five (Shame, it's a shame)
