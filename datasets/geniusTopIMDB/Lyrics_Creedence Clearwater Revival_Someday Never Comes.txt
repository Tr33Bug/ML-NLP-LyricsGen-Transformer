Someday Never Comes Lyrics
First thing I remember, was asking papa "Why?"
For there were many things I didn't know
And Daddy always smiled, took me by the hand
Saying, "someday you'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast, you'd better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
The time and tears went by, and I collected dust
For there were many things I didn't know
When Daddy went away, he said "try to be a man
And someday you'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast, you'd better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes

And then, one day in April, I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know
A son was born to me, mama held his hand
Saying "someday you'll understand"

Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast, you'd better learn it young
'Cause someday Never Comes
Ooh, someday never comes

Think it was September, the year I went away
For there were many things I didn't know
And I still see him standin, tryin' to be a man
I said, "someday you'll understand"
You might also like
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast, you'd better learn it young
'Cause someday never comes
Ooh someday never comes
