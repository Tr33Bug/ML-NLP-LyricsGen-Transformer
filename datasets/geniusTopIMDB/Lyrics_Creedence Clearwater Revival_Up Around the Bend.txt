Up Around the Bend Lyrics
There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Oooh!
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Oooh!

You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!

Oooh!

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me
You might also like
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!

Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo, ooh
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo, yeah
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, all right5Embed
