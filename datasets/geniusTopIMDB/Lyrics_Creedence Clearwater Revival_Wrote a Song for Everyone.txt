Wrote a Song for Everyone Lyrics
Met myself a coming county welfare line
I was feeling strung out, Hung out on the line
Saw myself a going down to war in June
All I want, all I want is to write myself a tune

Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you
Got myself arrested, Wound me up in jail
Richmond 'bout to blow up, communication failed
If you see the answer, now's the time to say
All I want, all I want, is to get you down to pray

Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you

Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you

Saw the people standing thousand years in chains
Somebody said it's different now, look, it's just the same
Pharaohs spin the message, round and round the truth
They could have saved a million people, how can I tell you?

Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you
You might also like
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to you

Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldn't even talk to youEmbed
