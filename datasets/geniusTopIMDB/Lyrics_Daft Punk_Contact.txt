Hey, Bob
I'm lookin' at what, uh, Jack was talkin' about
And, uh, it's definitely not a particle that's nearby
It is a, uh, bright object
And it's, uh, obviously rotating because it's flashing
It's, uh, way out in the distance
Currently rotating in a very rhythmic fashion
Because the, uh, flashes come around, uh, almost on time
As we look back at the earth, it's, uh, up at about 11 o'clock
About, uh, well, maybe ten or twelve dianrersâ€”diameters, uh
I don't know whether that does you any good
But there's somethin' out there
