Get Lucky (Grammy Rehearsal) Lyrics
Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning


We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky (x4)

The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling
If you wanna leave, I'm with it


We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
You might also likeWe're up all night to get harder
We're up all night to get better
We're up all night to get faster
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
We're up all night to get stronger
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

Ahh, freak out!
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
Freak out!
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
Freak out!
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
Freak out!
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
Freak out!
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
Freak out!
Harder, better, faster, stronger
Freak out!
More than ever, hour after, our work is never over


La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la

For you
There might be a brighter star
But in my eyes
The light of you is all I see
