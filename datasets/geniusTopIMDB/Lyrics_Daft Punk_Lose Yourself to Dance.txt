Lose Yourself to Dance Lyrics
I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speedin' and it isn't stoppin'
Here, take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speedin' and it isn't stoppin'
Here, take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat
