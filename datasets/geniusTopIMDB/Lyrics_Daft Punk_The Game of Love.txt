The Game of Love Lyrics
There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away


There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When I wanted you to stay


And it was you
I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stayYou might also like8Embed
