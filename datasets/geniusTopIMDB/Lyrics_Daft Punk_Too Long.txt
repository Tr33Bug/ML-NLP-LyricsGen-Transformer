Too long

(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's getting strong
(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's in my bones
(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's getting strong
(Too long) It's been much too long, I feel it coming on
(Too long) The feeling's in my bones
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?

At last the long wait is over, the weight is off my shoulders
I'm taking all control, yeah
My, my mind is set so free, I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me

(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?

I see, you feel the way I do, the feelingâ€™s oh so true
The good feelings coming through
My, my mind is set so free, I'm where I want to be
To get the best of me

(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
(Too long) Can you feel it?
(Too long) Oh, can you feel it?
