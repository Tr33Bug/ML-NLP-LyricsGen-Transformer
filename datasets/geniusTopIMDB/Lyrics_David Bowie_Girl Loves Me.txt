Girl Loves Me Lyrics
Cheena so sound, so titi up this malchick, say
Party up moodge, nanti vellocet round on Tuesday
Real bad dizzy snatch making all the omies mad - Thursday
Popo blind to the polly in the hole by Friday

Where the fuck did Monday go?
I'm cold to this pig and pug show
I'm sittin' in the chestnut tree
Who the fuck's gonna mess with me?
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me

Where the fuck did Monday go?
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
I'm cold to this pig and pug show
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)
Where the fuck did Monday go?
(Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)

You viddy at the cheena
Choodesny with the red rot
Libbilubbing litso-fitso
Devotchka watch her garbles
Spatchko at the rozz-shop
Split a ded from his deng deng
Viddy viddy at the cheena

Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me (Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
