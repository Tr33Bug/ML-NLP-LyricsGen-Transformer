I Canâ€™t Give Everything Away Lyrics

I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything awayYou might also like18Embed
