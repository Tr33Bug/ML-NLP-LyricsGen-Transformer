Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) Lyrics
She had an horror of rooms, she was tired, you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes, they were blue but nobody home
Well, she could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do
And she do
She opened strange doors that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well, I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails Jimmy's guitar sound, jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean

Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running, running scared8Embed
