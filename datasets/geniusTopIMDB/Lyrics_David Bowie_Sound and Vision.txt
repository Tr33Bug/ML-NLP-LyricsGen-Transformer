Sound and Vision Lyrics

Ahhhh
Ahhhh
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?
Blue, blue, 'lectric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?You might also like9Embed
