Valentineâ€™s Day Lyrics
Valentine told me who's to go
Feelings he's treasured most of all
The teachers and the football star

It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine told me so
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day
The rhythm of the crowd
Teddy and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day
Valentine told me how it feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall

It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine knows it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

(Yeah)
Valentine Valentine
(Yeah) (Woo) (Woo)
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hand
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hands
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
