Action! Not Words Lyrics
I'm sick and tired of the damn TV
I'm gonna make my own movie
I wanna star in a late night show
And all I need is my video
Shock me, make it electric
Shock me, make it last
Curtain up let the camera roll
It's automatic, it's in control
Got no script baby, ain't no lines
Just me and you and a real good time, oh
Shock me, make it electric
Shock me, make it last
Shock me, gimme thunder and lightning
Shock me, oh babe I need it fast
Because all I need is some
Action, action, action, not words
Gimme action, action, action not words

Come on and shock me
Let the cameras roll

I'll be the hero, you be the star
With your wine and your caviar
No audition, a starring roll
I'll be your Bogart and you be Monroe, yeah
Shock me, make it electric
Shock me, oh bump and grind
Shock me, make a night to remember
Shock me, do it one more time
So cut me in on the action

Lights, camera, sound
I need action

Action, action, gimme action not words
Let the camera roll
Action, action, action not words
I need a little
You might also like
Action, action, action not words
Well, shake a little piece of your
Action, action, action not words
Come on, talk to me with your body
