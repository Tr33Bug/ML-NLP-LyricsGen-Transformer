Action LyricsSo you think you'll take another piece of me
To satisfy your intellectual need
Do you want, do you want
Action, action, action, action
Gonna bring you down
Cause you've been pushing me
You've got to recognize my superiority
Liar, liar, liar, liar
You know you believed it
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Cause I'm the main man
And that's why, everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I've got what everybody needs satisfaction guarantees
That everybody wants a piece of the action
Oh, I was suicidal cause you was my idol
Baby, baby, baby, bring it to your knees
Oh, there was a time I would have walked the line
But you bled me dry with your insatiable greed
Liar, liar, liar, liar
You know you believed it
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Cause I'm the main man
And that's why, everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I've got what everybody needs satisfaction guarantees
That everybody wants a piece of the action
Do you want, do you want action?
Everybody wants, everybody needs
Everybody wants, everybody needs
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I've got what everybody needs satisfaction guarantees
That everybody wants a piece of the action, action, action
Action, action, action, actionYou might also likeEmbed
