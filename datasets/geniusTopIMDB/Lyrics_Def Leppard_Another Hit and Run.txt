Another Hit and Run Lyrics
Union Jack is back with a hole in his head
He's getting badly burned every time
He's laughing at me and dancing on my sneakers
And his sixties songs are blowing up my speakers

I say, "You got no respect
Respect for authority
You're just playing your dirty tricks
And then come crying to me"
Hit and run
Hit and run
It's just a hit and run
Another hit and run

The bulldog lost his bite and his breath has gone bad
And the whole damn world is really laughing mad

I say, "You got no respect
Respect for authority
You're just playing your dirty tricks
And then come crying to me"

Hit and run
Hit and run
It's just a hit and run
Another hit and run

Hit it, oh yeah
Oh, bring it down
Oh, you bring it down
You might also like
I said you ain't got no respect
I said you ain't got no respect
No you ain't got no respect
And you hit me when I'm down

Hit and run
Hit and run
It's just a hit and run
I said it's just another hit and run

Oh yeah, hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run
It's just another hit and run
Hit and run1Embed
