Bringinâ€™ On the Heartbreak LyricsGypsy, sittin' looking pretty
A broken rose with laughin' eyes
You're a mystery, always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin', searchin' for a feeling
But it's easy come and easy go
Oh, I'm sorry but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me, oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh, can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see? Oh
You're such a secret, misty eyed and shady
Lady, how you hold the key
Oh, you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me, can't you see
Just tryin' to say to you
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me, oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh, can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see, can't you see
No, no, no
You got the best of me, oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me, oh, can't you see?
