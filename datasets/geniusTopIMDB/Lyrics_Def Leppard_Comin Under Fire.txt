Cominâ€™ Under Fire Lyrics
Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone
But watch it break when I get you alone
Take a chance, come lay down with me
Oh, I want to make it
Slow and steady never lost the race
Don't stop running, I'm a fool for the chase
Play the game, surrender to me
Baby, I don't want to fake it

Is it any wonder
You got me coming under fire?
Coming like thunder
You know you make me walk the wire
It's so easy to put on a show
Your body says yes but you won't let it go
But my passion it won't slip away
Oh I'm not going crazy


Under fire
You got me coming, under fire
You got me coming, under fire
Oh yeah, I'm coming, under fire
You body says yes but baby, please let it go
Let it go, yeah, yeah

You got me, I'm coming my back to the wall
No bed of roses, ain't no bed at all
I'm walking the wire, I stumble and fall
I got my message but I ain't gonna crawl


Under fire
You got me coming, under fire
You got me coming, under fire
Oh yeah, I'm coming, under fireYou might also like1Embed
