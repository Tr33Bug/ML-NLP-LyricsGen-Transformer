Die Hard the Hunter Lyrics
Let's welcome home the soldier boy
(Far away, far away)
No angel of mercy just a need to destroy
(Far away, far away)
Let's toast the hero with blood in his eyes
The scars on his mind took so many lives
Die hard the hunter
Welcome home soldier boy
Put down your pistol, yeah, put down your toy
Yeah, they can take the gun away from you
But never take away your attitude
They can't do that, no no no, they can't do that
You got no enemy, no front line
The only battle's in the back of your mind
You don't know how to change from bad to good
You brought the war to your neighborhood
You can't do that, you can't do that
They can't do that, no no no, they can't do that

(Die hard)
You're caught in a trap
(Hunter)
There's no looking back
(Die hard)
He's lost in the crowd
(Hunter)
Die hard and proud

Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
You might also like
Back in the city he's a man on the loose
He is the shadow that's following you
He takes no prisoners, when he's hunting for game
He's got a bullet and it carries your name
You can't do that, you can't do that, you can't do that

(Die hard)
You're caught in a trap
(Hunter)
There's no looking back
(Die hard)
He's lost in the crowd
(Hunter)
Die hard and proud
(Die hard)
You're caught in a trap
(Hunter)
There's no looking back
(Die hard)
He's lost in the crowd
(Hunter)
Die hard and proud
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter

Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
You can't do that
You can't do that, no no no1Embed
