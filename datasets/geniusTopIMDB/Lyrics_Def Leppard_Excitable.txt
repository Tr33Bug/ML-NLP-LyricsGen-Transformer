Stand up, say yeah, stand up

Ah, this obsession
It's getting a-inviting
A little a, X-rated
A little bit exciting

Stand up, stand up, say yeah

You know I get so excitable
I really get so excitable
I want to get you excitable
So come on, let's go
Ah, baby, don't say no

Ah, this temptation
It gets-a a-outrageous
Ha, it's such a, a sensation
A little bit contagious, hey, hey

Obsession, obsession

Inch by inch, mile by mile
What I do I do in style
You got your leather, la-lace, long and lean
Ballistic a lipstick dream machine

Ah, do it, do it
Hey, come on and do it
You know I get so excitable

So come on, let's go

So beby on, let's go excitable
You know I get so excitable

You got me shivering, excitable1Embed
