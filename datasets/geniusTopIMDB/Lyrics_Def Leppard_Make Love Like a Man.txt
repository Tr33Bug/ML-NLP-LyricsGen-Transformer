Make Love Like a Man Lyrics
Make love like a man
I'm a man
That's what I am
Come on

All you girls around the world
Looking for a guy who's a real go-getter, yeah
Every guy grab a girl
Love her like a man, make her feel a lot better, yeah
Everybody
(If you want it) I'm the one
(I got it) I'm Mr. Fun
(If you need it) I'm Captain Cool, yeah
(Come get it) And I've come for you
Come on

Don't call me gigolo, don't call me Casanova
Just call me on the phone and baby come on over
When you need someone
When you need someone to

Make love like a man
I'm a man
That's what I am, yeah
Make love like a man
Your kinda man
That's what I am

Every day, every night
Take her little heart until it beats like a hammer, yeah, oh
Come, come on, do it good, do it right
Crazy little girl going to stutter and stammer
Oh yeah

Give me some rock n' roll
Little bit of rock n' roll
Got to be rock n' roll
Little bit of rock n' roll
 (Phil Collen)
A little bit of love goes a long, long way
Got to get it on if you really want to get her
Never ever wait it's a little to late
Love her like a man, make her feel a lot better
(If you want it) Yeah, baby
(I got it) Why not
(If you need it) Oh, oh
(Come get it) Oh, come on



Hey, get it while you can (Make love)
I want to be your man (Like a man)
Baby understand (I'm a man)
I'm a m-m-man
(Make love) Make love
(Like a man) Like a man
Your kinda man
Oh, you love her like a man
She's going to feel a lot better
And that's a factEmbed
