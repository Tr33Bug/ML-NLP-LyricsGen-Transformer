Miss You in a Heartbeat LyricsI believe that there is something deep inside
That shouldn't be from time to time
I sure found out, thought love was such a crime
The more you care, the more you fall
No need to worry, no need to turn away
'Cause it don't matter, anyway
Baby
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh, I miss you right away
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
'Cause it ain't love if it don't feel that way
When we touch, I just lose my self-control
A sad sensation I can't hide
To love is easy; it ain't easy to walk away
I keep the faith, and there's a reason why
No need to worry, no need to turn away
'Cause it don't matter, anyway
Baby
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh, I miss you right away
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
'Cause it ain't love if it don't feel that way
Now, I ain't big on promises
But I'll be true to you
'Cause I'd do about anything, yeah
For someone like
Baby, for you
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh, I miss you right away
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
'Cause it ain't love if it don't feel that wayYou might also likeEmbed
