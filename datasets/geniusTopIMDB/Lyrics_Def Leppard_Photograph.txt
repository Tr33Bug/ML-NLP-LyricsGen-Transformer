Photograph Lyrics
Huh!

I'm outta luck, outta love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch

I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done

(Photograph)
I don't want your (Photograph)
I don't need your (Photograph)
All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child, oh

You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free, so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done
You might also like
I gotta have your (Photograph)
I don't want your (Photograph)
I don't need your (Photograph)
All I've got is a photograph
You've gone straight to my head


Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh-oh, look what you've done
I gotta have your

I gotta have your (Photograph)
I don't want your (Photograph)
I don't need your (Photograph)
All I've got is a photograph
I want to touch you

Ohhh
(Photograph, photograph)
Ohh yeah, photograph
(Photograph, photograph)
I need more, baby
(Photograph)
I'm all outta love
(Photograph)
I wanna love
(Photograph)
You're the only one
(Photograph)
I want to touch16Embed
