Pour Some Sugar on Me (Version) LyricsHit me like a bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Hit me like a bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Hit me like a bomb, baby, come on get it on
Living like a lover with a radar phone
Looking like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man, be your man, hey, hey
Razzle and a dazzle and a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss-a-innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah
Come on take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up
Pour some sugar on me, ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me, come on fire me up
Pour your sugar on me, I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet, from my head to my feet, yeah
Listen red light, yellow light, green-a-light go
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of the love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up, loosen up, a loosen up
You gotta tease a little, squeeze a little, tease a little more
Easy operator come-a-knocking on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss-a-innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah, give a little more
Take a bottle, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up
Pour some sugar on me, ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me, come on fire me up
Pour your sugar on me, oh I can't get enough
I'm hot, sticky sweet from my head to my feet, yeah
You got the peaches, I got the cream sweet to taste, saccharine
'Cause I'm hot, hot, so hot, sticky sweet
From my head, my head, to my feet
Do you take the sugar, one lump or two?
Take a bottle, take a bottle
Shake it up, shake it up
Break the bubble, break it up
Break it up
Pour some sugar on me, ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me, come on fire me up
Pour your sugar on me, oh, I can't get enough
Pour some sugar on me, oh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me, get it, come get it
Pour your sugar on me, ooh
Pour some sugar on me, yeah
