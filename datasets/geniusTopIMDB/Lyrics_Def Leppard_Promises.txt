Promises Lyrics
Last night I was blown away
I said a million things I'd never say
I was knocked right down, it got to me
Going to get me some of your chemistry

You want me to promise you
That everything is true

I won't make promises that I can't keep
I won't make promises that I don't mean
I'll even mean the things I tell you in my sleep, yeah
I won't make promises babe, that I can't keep
Oh my my, I lost control
I told you everything, I said it all
You came right out and said to me
Going to get me some of your honesty




I won't make promises that I can't keep
I won't make promises that I don't mean
I'll even mean the things I whisper in my sleep
Oh, let me tell you
I won't say a single thing darling, that you can't believe
You got to believe me
I won't make promises that I can't keep
Oh baby believe me now
I won't make promises that I don't mean
Oh why won't you believe me now
I'll even mean the things I whisper in my sleep, yeah
I won't make promises that I can't keep
Baby, you got to believe meYou might also like1Embed
