Run Riot Lyrics
Living by the law is a bloody necessary bore
Everybody, are you getting what you're looking for?
Living by the rule is something that you got to do
But does it matter if we (Break a rule or two?)

Get up, break out
Don't be the odd one out

Living on the edge, I'm a try and keep a level head
(Oh!)
Every morning it's a bummer getting out of bed
Same old story, doesn't nothing ever ever change?
Yeah, they lock me up and then they let me out again
Get up, break out
Don't be the odd one out
Come on, it's alright
We're hot tonight

You better run
(Run, run riot)
You got to run
(Run, run riot)
You know the time has come
(Run, run riot)
I mean everyone
(Run, yeah, run riot)
Oh, got to riot, babe

Going through the motions, desperation guaranteed
Whoa, get frustrated easily
Pedal to the metal, senses working overtime
Oh, a fight to the finish, babe, draw the line


Run
(Run, run riot)
You got to run
(Run, run riot)
You know the time has come
(Run, run riot)
I mean everyone
(Run, yeah, run riot)
You might also like
Speak to me
They lock me up, they let me out
But I'm up and running
I scream and shout


You better run
(Run, run riot)
You got to run
(Run, run riot)
You know the time has come
(Run, run riot)
Come on, run with me
(Run, run riot)
(Run, run riot)

Hey, I'll take you from your misery
Come on, stick with meEmbed
