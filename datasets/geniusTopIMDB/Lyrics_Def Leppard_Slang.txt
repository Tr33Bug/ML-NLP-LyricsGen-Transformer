Slang Lyrics
Sitting dark getting taken because I said
Something lewd in a low down accent, yeah yeah yeah
Kind of love those eyes
I want to get down honey, ain't your guy

I'll rap and ruck and jam it up but count me out
Because all I ever wanna get is slang

Slang with me, I don't want to get my hands dirty
Slang with me, I just want to get soaking wet
Slang with me, I don't want to get my hands dirty
All I ever want to get is slang
What's affecting my condition
What's about to knock you down
Said wrapped and bound and a goddamn
I'd love to get connected but it's out of my hand



It's my intention to be your obsession
It's my obsession to be your addiction
