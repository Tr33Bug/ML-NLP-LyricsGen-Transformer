Tonight Lyrics
Aaah! Ooh...

I don't want to play the waiting game
And drift away leaving an illusion
I don't want to hide, it's foolish pride
To close my eyes a touch away from wanting you
Don't try to look away when you're face to face
I see your eyes that animal emotion
You don't have to set your tender trap
It's in those eyes, it's going to happen anyway
Moving to the rhythm of your heartbeat, yeah
I'm wanting, willing, touching you, we'll be
Moving to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Ooh babe, when you get that rhythm
Going to move into your room

Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight so right, this night could be dynamite
Wait and see, if it pleases you it pleases me

There's nothing I can say, it's no mystery
It's in your eyes, those eyes are where I wanted them
So give me heart and soul, I lose control
Can't stop my eyes from falling into fantasy


Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight so right, this night could be dynamite
Wait and see check it out
You might also like

Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight I want to win the greatest prize
Tonight so right, this night could be dynamite
Wait and see, if it pleases you it pleases meEmbed
