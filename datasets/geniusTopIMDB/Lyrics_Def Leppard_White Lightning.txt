White Lightning Lyrics
No promises, no guarantees
When you come down here you're already on your knees
You want to ride white lightning then sign your name
If you want to dance with the Devil
You got to play his way, play the game
You got to taste that sweetness
Because you can't say no
But are you ready for the nightmare when you can't let go
Like a soldier of fortune when the money runs dry
You got rivers of bitter tears in your eyes
You want to leave but you can't let go
You want stop but you can't say no
You'll never laugh about it, you just can't live without it
You had enough but you just want more
You never get what you're looking for
You'll never laugh about it, never

You got both ends burning like a moth to a flame
You're going off the rails like a runaway train
It's a no win situation, there's no way out
And no one will ever hear you
Scream and shout


Run, he's coming to claim you
Run, nowhere to hide away
Run, you dance with danger
Run, oh, you got to ride the

White lightning on a dead end street
White lightning, where the deadbeats meet
White lightning, it's a one way ride
White lightning, oh, there's nowhere to hide
Oh, can you believe me babe?
You might also like
Such a lonely road you ride
It's not easy when you don't know why
Such a heavy load you hide
You never leave no matter how you try



White lightning, can you feel it, can you feel it?
White lightning, it's so dangerous
White lightning, no promises, no guarantees
