Behind the Wheel Lyrics
My little girl, drive anywhere
Do what you want, I don't care
Tonight I'm in the hands of fate
I hand myself over on a plate now

Oh, little girl, there are times when I feel
I'd rather not be the one behind the wheel
Come, pull my strings
Watch me move, I do anything, please

Sweet little girl, I prefer
You behind the wheel and me the passenger
Drive, I'm yours to keep
Do what you want, I'm going cheap tonight


You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight
You're behind the wheel tonightYou might also like3Embed
