But Not Tonight Lyrics
Oh God, it's raining, but I'm not complaining
It's filling me up with new life
The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

Just for a day on a day like today
I'll get away from this constant debauchery
The wind in my hair makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight
And I haven't felt so alive
In years

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight

Oh God, it's raining and I'm not containing
My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own, all on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
I'd been mistaken for dead
But not tonightYou might also like5Embed
