No More (This is the Last Time) Lyrics
One more ride
I can't explain
Our hesitation
We stop and start again
Repeat the process
We repeat the lie
Time and time again
By and by

This is the last time
I'll say goodbye
The last time
Then we won't have to lie
The last time
Call it what you want
You don't mean a thing to me no more
You go your way
I'll go mine
We've walked this line together
For the longest time
We've climbed the mountain
In so many ways
Reach the top
Then slowly fade away

This is the last time
I'll say goodbye
The last time
Then we won't have to lie
The last time
Call it what you want
You don't mean a thing to me no more

Our crimes
Will pass us by
Crimes
They all fade and die
All those memories
All our pain
Will slowly disappear
Like the falling rain
You might also like
This is the last time
I'll say goodbye
The last time
Then we won't have to lie
The last time
(All those memories, all our pain)
This is the last time
(All those memories, all our pain)
The last timeEmbed
