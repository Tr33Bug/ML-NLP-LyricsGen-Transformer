So Much Love Lyrics
I can't lie
I can't fake
I can't act
My hands shake
There's disclosure
I must make

There is so much love in me
I can't run
I have tried
There's a thorn
In my side
There is something
I can't hide

There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

There's a fire
In my veins
The desire
Causes pain
I will say it
Again
You might also like
There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me1Embed
