The Worst Crime Lyrics
There's a lynching in the square
You will have to join us
Everyone's going to be there
We're setting up the truss
Once there were solutions
Now we have no excuses
They got lost in confusion
So we're preparing the nooses

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?
Blame misinformation
Misguided leaders
Apathetic hesitation
Uneducated readers
For whatever reason
We now find ourselves in this
We are all charged with treason
There is no one left to hiss

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

We're the judge and the jury
The hangman, the convict
It's too late for fury
Our indictment was handpicked
So step up to the gallows
And accept your sentence
For being so shallow
You must pay your penance

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?
And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?You might also likeEmbed
