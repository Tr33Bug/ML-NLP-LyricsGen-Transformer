You Move Lyrics
We had something but that was yesterday
Temptations knocking at my door
You talk to me about the life we could've had
But we don't have that life no more

But I like the way you move
Yeah I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright now
If you give me something that you and I can play
Let me ring your bell
I don't need you, I don't need your ball and chain
There's no water in that well

But I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright yeah
All night
Alright now
All night

Imagination is all it takes
You came knocking at my door
You talk to me about the life we should have
You know, you could have given more

But I like the way you move
Yeah I like the way you move for me tonight
Yeah I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright now
All nightYou might also likeEmbed
