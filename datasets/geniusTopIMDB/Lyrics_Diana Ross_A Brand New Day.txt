A Brand New Day LyricsI. "A Brand New Day"
Everybody look around
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice, you see
(Everybody come out)
(And let's commence to singing joyfully)

Everybody look up
And feel the hope that we've been waiting on
(Everybody is glad)
(Because our silent fear and dread is gone)
Freedom, you see
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
(Just look about)
(You owe it to yourself to check it out)

Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?

Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up
Into the morning, into happiness

Hello world!
It's like a different way of living, now
(And thank you, world)
We always knew that we'd be free somehow

In harmony
Let's show the world that we've got liberty
It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
You might also like
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?

Everybody be glad (Be glad)
Because the sun is shining just for us (Yes, it is)
Everybody wake up (Wake up)
Into the morning, into happiness (That's right)

Hello world!
It's like a different way of living, now
(Thank you, world)
We always knew that we'd be free somehow

In harmony
Let's show the world that we've got liberty
It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
