Amazing Grace LyricsAmazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind
But now I see
The earth shall soon
Dissolve like snow
The sun forget to shine
But God who brought me here below
Will be forever mine
Through him many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'T was grace that brought me here thus far
And grace will lead me homeYou might also likeEmbed
