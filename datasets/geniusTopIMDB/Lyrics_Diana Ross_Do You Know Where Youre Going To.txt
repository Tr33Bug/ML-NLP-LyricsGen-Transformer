Do You Know Where Youre Going To LyricsDo you know where you're goin' to?
Do you like the things that life is showin' you
Where are you goin' to? Do you know?
Do you get what you're hopin' for
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hopin' for? Do you know?
Once we were standin' still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you're goin' to?
Do you like the things that life is showin' you
Where are you goin' to? Do you know?
Now looking back at all we've planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be
Do you know where you're goin' to?
Do you like the things that life is showin' you
Where are you goin' to? Do you know?
Do you get what you're hopin' for
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hopin' for? Do you know?You might also likeEmbed
