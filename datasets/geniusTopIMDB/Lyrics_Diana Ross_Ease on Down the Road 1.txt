Ease on Down the Road #1 Lyrics
Ease On Down...
Ease On...Down the Road (Ah!)
Ease On Down...
Ease On, Down the Road
Ease On Down
Ease On, Down the Road! Woah!
Da-da...Come on Dorothy, don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, Ah!
(Oh! There it is!)

Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the road
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the road

Pick your left foot up when your right foot's down
(Come on legs keep movin', don't you lose no ground)
You just keep on keepin' on the road that you choose
Don't you give up walkin', 'cause you gave up shoes, no

Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the road

'Cause there may be times when you think you lost your mind
(And the steps you're takin' leave you three, four steps behind)
But the road you're walking might be long sometimes
You just keep on steppin' and you'll be just fine, yeah
You might also like
Ease on down, ease on down the road
Ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the...

Oh, there may be times when you wish you wasn't born
(And you wake one morning just to find that your courage's gone)
But just know that feeling only last a little while
You just stick with us and we'll show you how to smile, yeah

Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, get 'em up, ease on down the road2Embed
