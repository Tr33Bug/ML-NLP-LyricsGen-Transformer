I Ainâ€™t Been Licked LyricsRoll down the gangway
So they'll see that it's me
I know they'll wonder about my recovery
Yes, I lost a love that promised happiness
What my heart wouldn't accept
Put me to the test
They keep a holding me down
But I rise
Yes it can be done
They keep a holding me down
But I rise
They can't make me run
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Got my second wind
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Tell 'em I'm back again
Just say
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
Tell 'em for me
I ain't been licked
Like outa nowhere my whole world fell apart
Till this day no one knows
What I felt in my heart
All those precious things
Inside me tried to still
Hands I thought would help
Pushed me over the hill
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Yes, it can be done
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
They can't make me run
You might also likeKeep a holding me down
But I rise
Got my second wind
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Tell 'em I'm back again
Just say
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
Tell 'em for me
I ain't been licked
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Just to start again
Rise
Show 'em that I can
Rise
Found a brand new dream
Rise
Just to prove one thing
Just say
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
Tell 'em for me
I ain't been licked
I want the world to see
I ain't been licked
Although my love is gone
I ain't been licked
Somehow I carry one
I ain't been licked
I'll find the strength somehow
I ain't been licked
I think I'm ready now
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
I ain't been licked
I ain't been lickedEmbed
