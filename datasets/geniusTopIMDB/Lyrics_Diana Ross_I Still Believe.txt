I Still Believe Lyrics
In love, I still believe
It's all I ever need
The reason that I breathe
I just can't get enough
An old familiar friend
Call it Heaven sent
It never has to end
I still believe in love
Love
Pulling me up whenever I'm down
Giving me the faith I lost, but now I've found
Bringing me joy, giving me life
Looking forward I can leave my past behind

Darling, put your hands in mine
We're just having a good, good time
Stepping out in a nеw light
We're just having a good time (Good timе)

In love, I still believe
It's all I ever need
The reason that I breathe
I just can't get enough
An old familiar friend
Call it Heaven sent
It never has to end
I still believe in love

Every smile, every road
There's a light that guides me everywhere I go
Through lonely nights, it gets me close
It's in everything, I know, I know, I know
You might also like
Darling, put your hands in mine
We're just having a good, good time
Stepping out in a new light
We're just having a good time (Good time)

In love, I still believe
It's all I ever need
The reason that I breathe
I just can't get enough
An old familiar friend
Call it Heaven sent
It never has to end
I still believe in love
LoveEmbed
