Itâ€™s My House LyricsIt's my house and I live here
(I wanna tell you)
It's my house and I live here
There's a welcome mat at the door
And if you come on in
You're gonna get much more
There's my chair
I put it there
Everything you see
Is with love and care
It's my house and I live here
(I wanna tell you)
It's my house and I live here
On the table, there sits a rose
Through every window
A little light flows
Books of feeling on the shelf above
'Cause it was built for love
I was built for love
It's my house and I live here
(I wanna tell you)
It's my house and I live here
There's a candle to light the stairs
Where my dreams await someone to share
Oh, there's music on the radio
And good vibrations won't let me go
I put my name on the ceilin' above
'Cause it was buillt for love
It was built for love, ooh
You say you wanna move in with me
You say you wanna move in with me
Got to follow the rules to get me
Got to follow the rules to get me
You wanna visit my house
Say you wanna drop by
Wanna visit my house, yeah
To see me sometimes

And if you come on in
You're gonna get much more
I put my name in the ceilin' above
'Cause it was built for love
It was built for love
It's my house and I live here
(I wanna tell you)
It's my house and I live here2Embed
