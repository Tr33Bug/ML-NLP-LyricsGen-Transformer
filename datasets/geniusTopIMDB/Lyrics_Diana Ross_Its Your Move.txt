Itâ€™s Your Move Lyrics
I don't understand it 'cause you won't say yes
But you don't say no
You say you know we shouldn't, you keep holding out
But you don't let go

I'm giving up on trying
To sell you things that you ain't buying

It's your move, I've made up my mind
Time is running out, make a move
Oh, we can go on, do you understand?
It's all in your hands, it's your move
You're giving me the business with that old come-on
But you don't come across
You get me so excited, don't you know you're such a tease?
When I think you're getting hot, you're not

So what's the problem? What's wrong?
This kiss and miss, you know it can't go on

It's your move, I've made up my mind
Time is running out, make a move
'Cause we can't go on, I want you to know
It's your move, your turn to go


I'm giving up on trying
To sell you things that you ain't buying

It's your move, I've made up my mind
Time is running out, make a move
Oh, we can't go on, do you understand?
It's all in your hands
It's your move, I've made up my mind
Time is running out, make a move
Oh, we can't go on, do you understand?
It's all in your hands
It's your move, I've made up my mind
Time is running out, make a move
Oh, we can't go on, do you understand?
It's all in your hands
It's your move, I've made up my mind
Time is running outYou might also like7Embed
