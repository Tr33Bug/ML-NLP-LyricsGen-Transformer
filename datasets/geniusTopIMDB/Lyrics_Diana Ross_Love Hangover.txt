Love Hangover LyricsPart I
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
I think about it all the time
Thinking only makes me smile
And say, hey
I don't wanna shake it
I love the love you're making
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it
I think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you
I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
The sweetest hangover
Yeah
I don't wanna get over
(Sweet love)
