Love Is All That Matters Lyrics
Sometimes we make each other cry
Sometimes we're locked inside the prisons of our pride
Sometimes we break each others heart with the words we say
Let anger get in the way too many times

But always after all
Love is all that matters
After everything
One thing remains the same
One thing we cannot change, oh
We all have one heart
And one heart needs another
Love, love is all that matters
Love is all that matters
It matters after all
Sometimes we search this world for gold
When all we really need is just a hand to hold (To hold)
Sometimes we let the greatest treasure just slip away
With words we forget to say too many times

But always after all
Love is all that matters
After everything
One thing remains the same
One thing we cannot change, oh
We, we all have one heart
And one heart needs another
Love, love is all that matters
Love is all that matters
It matters after all

After all that we've been through
It comes down to one simple truth
You need me, I need you
'Cause love is all that matters
Love is all that matters (Love is all that matters)
Love is all that matters (Love is all that matters)
It matters after all
You might also like
Oh, love is all that matters
It's the only thing that matters
It matters after all, oh, oh
Love is all that mattersEmbed
