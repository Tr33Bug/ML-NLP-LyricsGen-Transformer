Missing You LyricsSince you've been away
I've been down and lonely
Since you've been away
I've been thinking of you
Trying to understand the reason you left me
What were you going through?
Oooh, oooh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Oooh, oooh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
As I look around, I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile made my heart filled with joy
I still recall all those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to, boy?
Oooh, oooh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)
Oooh, oooh.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Sometimes I wondered, I didn't understand
Just where were you trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there, but you wouldn't let me in
But now you've gone away, boy
I feel so brokenhearted.  (Oh.)
I knew the day we started that we were meant to be
If only you'd let me
I've cried so many tears.  (Oh.)
Gotta face now all my fears.  (Oh, oh.)
We let time slip away
I need you, boy, here again

There was so much of your dreams that were never told
You had so much hope for a brighter day
Why were you my flower plucked away?
(Oooh, oooh.  I'm missing you.)
Tell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh.  I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)
Tell me, tell me why.  (Oooh, oooh.  I'm missing you.)
Tell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)
Oh.  Don't understand it.  (Oooh, oooh, I'm missing you.)
Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  (Tell me why the road turns.)
Oooh, oooh.  I'm missing you
Tell me why the road turns.  (Tell me why the road turns.)4Embed
