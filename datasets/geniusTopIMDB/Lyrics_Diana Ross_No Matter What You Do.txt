No Matter What You Do Lyrics
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey
I never thought I'd feel this way
Al, don't play with me now
Please...can you take the hurt away?
Al
My love for you is a bottomless well
For your tears and your fears
And I do love you!

No matter what you do I'll love you (Yeah) all the same
I said no matter, no matter what you do
I'll love you (Oh) all the same, all the same
No matter what you do I'll love you (Yeah) all the same
No matter what you do I'll love you all the same
If we take our time, I know you'll be mine
If we were to share our love would always be there
(No matter what you do)
If you decide to go, then we will never know
But if, if you'll stay, our love would find a way
Oh no (I love you)

No matter what you do, I'll love you (Yeah) all the same
(I said no matter)
No matter what you do, I'll love you (Oh) all the same (All the same)
No matter what you do, I'll love you all the same
No matter what you do, I'll love you all the same

Do you love me? Let me know
Don't keep it inside, let it show
If you and I were meant to be
In your dreams you'd see the things that I see
(No matter what you do)
If you don't want me (I want you), just tell me honestly
You know I can't take this pain
So please hold me now and whisper my name (Diana)
Hold me, oh, I just want you to hold me (Like this?)
(I love you)
You might also like
No matter what you do, I'll love you (Yeah) all the same
(I said no matter)
No matter what you do, I'll love you (Oh) all the same
No matter what you do, I'll love you (Oh) all the same
No matter what you do, I'll love you (Oh) all the same

No matter what you do (No matter)
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore (I love you, I love you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh baby (Baby), what we're doing, (What we're doing)
Who we fooling? (Fooling)
Let's stop hiding (No more hiding)
From the feelings that we feel inside, yeah
I love you
Ooh-ooh-ooh
No, no, no, no (Oh no)
I never thought I'd feel this way, oh
I just want you to hold me, haha
Alright, you've gotta stop playing with me now
If you're serious there's no more fooling around (Okay)
No hiding (Alright, we won't hide then)
Just show your feelings
(You know I've always wanted to do that)
God bless the day that you came
How do I know you came for me?
(No matter what you do, I'll love you) No matter (All the same)
But you're gonna feel it, baby, yeah, young and strong
A love that lasts so long
(No matter what you do, I'll love you all the same)Embed
