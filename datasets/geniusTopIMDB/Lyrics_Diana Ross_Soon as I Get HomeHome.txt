Soon as I Get Home/Home LyricsPart 1: Soon As I Get Home

Miss one?

There's a feeling here inside
That I cannot hide
And I know I've tried
But it's turnin’ me around
I'm not sure that i'm aware
If I'm up or down or here or there
I need both feet on the ground
Maybe I’m just goin’ crazy
Lettin’ myself get uptight
I'm actin’ just like a baby
But I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be alright
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Part 2: Home

In a different place, in a different time
Different people around me
I would like to know of that different world
And how different they find me
And just what's a Wiz?
Is he big? Will he scare me?
If I ask to leave
Will the Wiz even hear me?
How will I know then
If I'll ever get home again?
Here I am alone
Though it feels the same
I don't know where I'm goin’
I'm here on my own and it's not a game
And a strange wind is blowin’
I'm so amazed at the things that I see here
Don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be here
In my mind this is clear
What am I doin’ here?

I wish I was home
I wish, I wish
I wish, I wishEmbed
