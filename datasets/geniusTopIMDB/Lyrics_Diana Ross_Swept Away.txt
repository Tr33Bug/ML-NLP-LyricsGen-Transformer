Swept Away Lyrics
I was lying there
Lying on the beach
I dreamed you were there
Feel the heat
The sun and the waves
When you touch my hand
We were on a desert island
And I had a dream
I was swept away
You and I are on an island
Where I thought the storm would never end
I saw your light on the horizon
And I knew that I was blown away again

No it doesn't matter
Yeah, it doesn't matter
'Cause nothing lasts forever
'Cause nothing last forever
No it doesn't matter
No it doesn't matter
'Cause nothing lasts forever
Nothing last forever

I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you
I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you

The rise and fall is endless
The risk you run of being lost in blue
You caught my drift while I was restless
When the current flows
I'm gonna flow with you
You might also like
No it doesn't matter
Yeah, it doesn't matter
'Cause nothing last forever
Nothing last forever
No it doesn't matter
No it doesn't matter
'Cause nothing last forever
Nothing last forever

I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you
I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you

For a day
Or maybe for a lifetime
Break away
Is he throwing me a lifeline
If I say
That this will be the last time
Swept away
Will it end with you?
I was swept away
Swept away
Swept away

No it won't, no it won't
No it doesn't matter
Nothing last foreverEmbed
