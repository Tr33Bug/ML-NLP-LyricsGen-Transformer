Thank You Lyrics
Every choice and step I make
Every word and breath I take
You're the reason my world keeps turning
Like the blood running through my veins
Sunshine when there's only rain
You're the reason my heart keeps learning

I will never let go of that feeling
'Cause loving you, it makes me feel strong
And when I feel the pain, you are my healing
And I know beside you is where I belong
'Cause loving feels like that, feels like that, woah
It will lift you up when that is what you need
Loving feels like that, feels like that, woah
I thank God that it is you who's loving me, hey

Thank you for, thank you for that (I just wanna say)
Thank you for, thank you for that (Thank you for the love)
Thank you for, thank you for that (I just wanna say thank you)
Thank you for, thank you for that (Thank you for my life)

We survived the highs and lows
Sometimes that's how life goes
But together I know we'll make it
I wouldn't change a single day
No one else makes me feel that way
I know you'll take care of my heart and never break it

I will never let go of that feeling
'Cause loving you, it makes me feel strong
And when I feel the pain, you are my healing
And I know beside you is where I belong, hey
You might also like
Loving feels like that, feels like that, woah
It will lift you up when that is all you need
Loving feels like that, feels like that, woah
I thank God that it is you who's loving me (Thank you, thank you)

Thank you for, thank you for that (I've just got to say)
Thank you for, thank you for that (Thank you for all the love)
Thank you for, thank you for that (Thank you)
Thank you for, thank you for that

Thank you for smiles, thank you for the tears
Thank you for being who you are for all those years
Thank you for joy, you are the reason why
I thank you for the loving you have brought into my life

Loving feels like that, feels like that, woah
It will lift you up when that is what you need
Loving feels like that, feels like that, woah
And I thank God that it is you who's loving me, thank you, Lord

Thank you for, thank you for that (I just wanna say)
Thank you for, thank you for that (Thank you, thank you, thank you)
Thank you for, thank you for that (Say It like you mean it, yeah)
Thank you for, thank you for thatEmbed
