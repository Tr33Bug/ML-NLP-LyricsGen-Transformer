Touch Me in the Morning Lyrics
Touch me in the mornin'
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday

Hey, wasn't it me who said
That nothin' good's gonna last forever
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand your feelin' that way
Everybody's got their life to live
Well, I can say goodbye
In the cold mornin' light
But I can't watch love die
In the warmth of the night

If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to
Have tonight, when you're gone
'Til you go, I need to
Lie here and think about
The last time that you'll

Touch me in the mornin'
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me
Empty like before

Hey, wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us?
(Didn't we run?)
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again
You might also like
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

If I've got to be strong
Don't you know I need to
Have tonight, when you're gone
'Til you go, I need to
Hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and

Touch me in the mornin'
(In the mornin')
We're blue and gold
And we could feel one another livin'
(Then just walk away)
We walked with a dream to hold
And we could take what the world was givin'
(We don't have tomorrow)
There's no tomorrow here
There's only love and the time to chase it
(But we had yesterday)
Yesterday's gone, my love
There's only now and it's time to face it
(Touch me in the mornin')1Embed
