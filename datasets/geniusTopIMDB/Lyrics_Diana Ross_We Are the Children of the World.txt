We Are the Children of the World LyricsWaiting on the wings
On the wings of time
Wonder what's to come
And what we will find
Dancing on a dream
In the magic of our mind
Reaching for the sun
As long as it shines
Living day to day
While we're on our way
We'll find we're already there
We are the children
We are the children
We are the children of the world
Underneath the blue
In a solitary light
Guiding by a star
A star in the night
The enemy we see
Is the enemy inside
Knowing we can win
Without knowing why
We'd be lost in hope
While we search for more
We find we're already there
We are the children
We are the children
We are the children of the world
We are the children
We are the children
We are the children of the world
You might also likeHow many times do we look to the sky
Knowing we've nothing to lose
We are the children who wanted to fly
Now we can fly to the moon
We are the children
We are the children
We are the children of the world
We are the children
We are the children
We are the children of the worldEmbed
