When We Grow Up LyricsWhen we grow up, will I be pretty?
Will you be big and strong?
Will I wear dresses that show off my knees?
Will you wear trousers twice as long?
Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all
And I don't care if you never get tall
I like what I look like, and you're nice small
We don't have to change at all
Hey!
When we grow up, will I be a lady?
Will you be an engineer?
Will I have to wear things like perfume and gloves?
I can still pull the whistle while you steer
Well, I don't care if I'm pretty at all
And I don't care if you never get tall
I like what I look like, and you're nice small
We don't have to change at all
When I grow up, I'm gonna be happy and do what I like to do
Like making noise and making faces and making friends like you
And when we grow up, do you think we'll see
That I'm still like you and you're still like me?
I might be pretty; you might grow tall
But we don't have to change at all
Spoken: I don't want to change, see, 'cause I still want to be your friend, forever and ever and ever and ever and everYou might also likeEmbed
