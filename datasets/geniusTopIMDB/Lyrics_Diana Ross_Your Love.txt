Your Love LyricsSometimes when I'm sitting all alone
I think of things that I have done
And start to wonder if there's one thing
That means more than others I have known
And suddenly it's clear to me
Without your love where would I be
Your love has kept me going
Through good and bad times
It's kept me growing
Like a steady flame
Your love has kept on burning
Through sweet and sad times
I'll keep returning to the magic of your love
Through the years my dreams may come and go
For fortune is a fleeting time
And no one knows what time may bring
But through the highs and lows of it I'll know
That there's one thing of which I'm sure
The one thing I've been living for
Your love has kept me going
Through good and bad times
It's kept me growing
Like a steady flame
Your love has kept on burning
Through sweet and sad times
I'll keep returning to the magic of your love
Your love has kept me going
Through good and bad times
It's kept me growing
Like a steady flame
Your love has kept on burning
Through sweet and sad times
I'll keep returning to the magic of your love
I'll keep returning to the magic of your love
