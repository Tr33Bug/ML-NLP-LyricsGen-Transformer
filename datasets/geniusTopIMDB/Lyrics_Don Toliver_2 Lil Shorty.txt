2 Lil Shorty Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
RamyOnTheBeat

[Verse 1]
Two lil' shorty on Bacardi
Gettin' naughty, fuck, let's party (Let's go)
Ride that Harley, feel exotic
Smoke that gas, puff then pass (Oh)
Is that your ho? I beg your pardon
If it's not, I'm shootin' my shot (Go)
I'm going for the win like James Harden
Did my diamonds stay solid? (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Shawty sloppy, lipstick poppin'
I get head all in the lobby (Let's go)
Fuck these niggas, they can't stop me
She hop in and pop a molly (Oh)
Did the dash, bound to crash
I call that shit perfect timin' (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Catch a vibe, grab a dime
Now my life is so exciting (So exciting)

[Chorus]
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
I pulled up with the top down (Skrrt, skrrt)
Touchdown, I'ma need that ass now (Uh)
I'm Lil Boosie with the wipe down (Uh)
Funny how these hoes really nice now (Yeah)
Wanna suck, wanna fuck in the nighttime (Get it)
Lookin' at my watch when the light shine (Yeah)
Fuck niggas hate on my grind (Brr)
I'ma keep thuggin' on one time (Brr)
I was on the run in the summertime
Had to break free from lockdown
Bitch, I'm stuck, I don't wanna leave
You gotta believe in me
Stacks of cash is all I see (Cash)
I got the club I don't need ID (Hell no)
I'ma turn up, yes indeed (Yeah)
I got the white on me
Funny how you look so lonely
I'ma come home, you can count on me, yeah, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)
Okay, okay, ayy (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
