Five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a— (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Shawty poppin' it for tips (Tips now)
Started at the crib (Woah), now she poppin' at the strip (Strip now, geek, geek)
We was at the crib then she turned it into LIV
She just left Miami, she just got that booty lift (Lift now)
You went and made a hit, oh, did you get it? (Hit)
Takin' all them trips, did you get it? (Clips)
Made it flip, did you get it?
Five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
Five timеs in a— I ain't have to ask her
Know exactly whеre you been, you been countin' bags up
You ain't doin' all that extra (Extra) to make a fast cut (Uh-huh)
If you up at least a hundred, she might pull a fast one (Uh)
[Chorus]
Five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a— (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Where you comin' from? It ain't groupie love (Let's get it)
Let me hit you back, on the one and up (Four)
Where you comin' from? It ain't groupie love (Yeah)
Let me hit you back, on the one and up
Yeah, I got her out the house, dancin' like a stripper
Movin' out her blouse, I might have to tip her (Wow)
Don't open your mouth, don't open your mouth (Shh)
Don't open your mouth, don't open your—

[Chorus]
Five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
Five times in a, five times in a row, I've seen you flip, yeah
