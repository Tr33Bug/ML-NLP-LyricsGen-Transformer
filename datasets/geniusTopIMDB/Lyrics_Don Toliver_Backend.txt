[Chorus]
M-m-made a lot of money on the back end (Yeah)
Yeah, lil' nigga, I'm taxin' (Yeah)
Pull up clean in the Aston
I'm bad like Michael Jackson (Woo)
What you want, nigga? I'm askin' (Uh-huh)
Got the bag in, ain't no cappin' (Uh-huh)
30 on my waist, fuck fashion (Brr)
Stretch the bitch out, it's elastic
M-m-made a lot of money on the back end (Yeah)
Yeah, lil' nigga, I'm taxin' (Yeah)
Pull up clean in the Aston
I'm bad like Michael Jackson (Woo)
What you want, nigga? I'm askin' (Uh-huh)
Got the bag in, ain't no cappin' (Uh-huh)
30 on my waist, fuck fashion (Brr)
Stretch the bitch out, it's elastic
[Verse 1]
Measure the lil' ho with a ruler (Yeah)
Hit you in your head, I'll do ya (Brr)
Fresh out, clean like a cooler (Cooler)
Ice tray, Johnny Dang (Ice)
Smoke radiate like hookah
Out of state, catchin' plays (Ayy)
Cheddar on the phone like, "Booyah"
If you want it, I'll send it right to ya (Let's go)
Blue .42 with the Ruger
Headshot, FaceTime, hoorah (Brr)
Milly turned mad with the ooh wah
Brr, we poppin' at you, huh (Let's go)
Pull up in a Lamb like Duwap
Hit it out the park like a Red Sock (Gone)
Smokin' hella weed in Bed-Stuy (Gone)
In New York with a bitch with her breast out
If you hate a nigga, say it with your chest out (Did it)
I'ma pull out the lot, I'ma cash out (Get it)
Thirty-four hundred, that's a cash out (Cash)
Got a bad lil bitch with her ass out (woo)
Tryna run a dice game, you gon' crap out (Crap)
Had to stuff APs in the stash house (P)
In my free time, I'ma tap out
I don't keep a laptop but the MAC out (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Don't owe you shit, nah-nah (Nah)

Pull up with that stick, lil' nigga
Hop out, let it hit, lil' nigga (Uh)
That's a 30 clip, lil' nigga (Uh)
Keep it on my hip, lil' nigga (Bow)
Road runner tryna get rich, lil' nigga (Skrt)
If you snitch, I'll put you in a ditch, lil' nigga
G-G-G-G-Gotti, no popstar (Uh)
The hate tryna put me in a cop car (Hahaha)
I'm sippin' and spillin' the hot sauce (Spill)
I'm tweakin', I'm itchin', the withdrawal (Damn)
The lean in my system, I need it all (Damn)
I'm bustin', I'm breakin' the system (Yeah)
Pussy nigga better call for your sister (Brr)

I'm hittin' the 3 like Chris Paul (Swish)
I was born in the whip, I'm warnin' ya (Swish)
I'm throwin' the party, it's Mardi Gras (Uh)
Better pay up your checks if you cut me off
I'ma be at the door with my head down
I need you and you with your bands out (Your bands)
See, I might have to go leave your bands out (What)
