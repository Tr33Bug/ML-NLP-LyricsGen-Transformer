Metro

[Verse 1]
I'm trapped in my room, lemme grab the broom
Sticks, bamboo (Yeah, yeah)
Different color shrooms
I'm the biggest Shamu (Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, yeah)
She rockin' Jimmy Choo, she kickin', Kung-fu (Uh-huh)

[Chorus]
She's so in love with me
I can't condone it, baby
I needed your company (Yeah)
She's so in love with me
I can't condone it, baby
I needed your company, company, company
[Verse 2]
Lemme tell you some
Got that white on white gold, yeah, it sparkle up (Yeah)
Got my blunt and my lighter, bitch, I'm parkin' up (Yeah)
She gon' bust it wide open for a emerald cut
When I lеave, I'm up
For a long time, can't keep it stuck
I'm on my own grind, I keep a cut
She want hеr own time, she tryna fuck

[Chorus]
She's so in love with me
I can't condone it, baby
I needed your company (Yeah)
She's so in love with me
I can't condone it, baby
I needed your company, company, company

[Verse 3]
Ain't good enough to go and walk to you (Walk to you)
Ain't good enough to go and talk to you
See what you sacrificed to go and change your life (Change your life)
I ain't mad at you one bit, you might just change your price
But your heart done got stolen, I can't control it
I can't control it, Don in my moment (Moment)
Down in my, down in my moment
You might also like[Chorus]
She's so in love with me (Yeah)
I can't condone it, baby (Yeah)
I needed your company (Uh uh)
She's so in love with me
I can't condone it, baby
I needed your company, company, company

[Refrain]
Just like it's white on white, girl
Just let me take my time, girl
Just like a diamond, you shine
I guess it's mine, all mine, girl
But I don't want no time, yeah
I hope it's lovin' you find, girl (Lovin' you find)
I hope it's lovin' you find, girl (Lovin' you find, girl)

[Chorus]
She's so in love with me
I can't condone it, baby
I needed your company (Company, company)
She's so in love with me
I can't condone it, baby
I need your company, company, company2Embed
