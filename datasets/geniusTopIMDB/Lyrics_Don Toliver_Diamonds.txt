Diamonds Lyrics[Chorus]
You know pressure make diamonds (Yeah)
Rollie on my wrist, perfect timin' (Uh-huh)
Dreams of havin' bitches menagin' (Uh-huh)
Foreign car parked in the driveway (Skrrt)
You know pressure make diamonds (Uh-huh)
Rollie on my wrist, perfect timin' (Yeah)
Dreams of havin' bitches menagin' (Uh-huh)
Foreign car parked in the driveway (Skrrt)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's what I'm made for
And what you suckers get paid for?
Dropped in the coupe, hit the old school Chevy
Thirty-five hundred on your head, come test me
Bend around the corner just to fuck with my ese
Call me Donny Burn when I'm down into LA
Runnin' up the motherfuckin' money like a relay
First things first, get the bag then I concentrate
[Chorus]
You know pressure make diamonds (Yeah)
Rollie on my wrist, perfect timin' (Uh-huh)
Dreams of havin' bitches menagin' (Uh-huh)
Foreign car parked in the driveway (Skrrt)
You know pressure make diamonds (Uh-huh)
Rollie on my wrist, perfect timin' (Yeah)
Dreams of havin' bitches menagin' (Uh-huh)
Foreign car parked in the driveway (Skrrt)

[Verse 2]
Drop off Sarah to go pick up Lisa (Haha)
She a bad bitch, she always had a visa
Oh, Michelle, a sexy se√±orita (Woo)
Girl, I know Simone got ass for no reason (Yeah)
I did it all in thirty-four seasons (Nah)
Baby, I'm sorry, I can't leave ya (For real)
I can't give you everything 'til I'm gone (Uh-uh)
Five, six bitches all naked in my home, dawg

[Chorus]
You know pressure make diamonds (Yeah)
Rollie on my wrist, perfect timin' (Uh-huh)
Dreams of havin' bitches menagin' (Uh-huh)
Foreign car parked in the driveway (Skrrt)
You know pressure make diamonds (Uh-huh)
Rollie on my wrist, perfect timin' (Yeah)
Dreams of havin' bitches menagin' (Uh-huh)
Foreign car parked in the driveway (Skrrt)You might also like3Embed
