Diva Lyrics[Intro]
You, player, player (Uh)
Player, player (Uh)
Uh

[Chorus]
I know she's a bad lil' diva (Huh)
Lurks outside, she has no reason (Huh)
Take your cash and swipe your Visa
Strip club poppin', she naked for the evening (Huh)
New Chanel poppin', she got the latest season (Huh)
White on white, she sexy for the weekend
I know she's a bad lil' diva (Huh)
Lurks outside, she has no reason (Huh)
Take your cash and swipe your Visa
Strip club poppin', she naked for the evening (Huh)
New Chanel poppin', she got the latest season (Huh)
White on white, she sexy for the weekend (Yuh)
[Verse 1]
It's a set up (Huh), keep your head up
Shawty got her edges (Huh), she keep her hair done
Pull up in a wrecked whip (Huh), it's a red one
She don't do no friendships (Huh), she gon' take some
But she do the benefits (Huh), if she make some
Yeah lil shawty innocent (Huh), 'til she takes some
Beatin' down her ribcage (Huh), 'til he breaks some
Shawty in her own world (Huh), she in The Matrix
'Til she realize (Huh) she really hates it
She live her own life (Huh), but never basic

[Chorus]
I know she's a bad lil' diva (Huh)
Lurks outside, she has no reason (Huh)
Take your cash and swipe your Visa
Strip club poppin', she naked for the evening (Huh)
New Chanel poppin', she got the latest season (Huh)
White on white, she sexy for the weekend
I know she's a bad lil' diva (Huh)
Lurks outside, she has no reason (Huh)
Take your cash and swipe your Visa
Strip club poppin', she naked for the evening (Huh)
New Chanel poppin', she got the latest season (Huh)
White on white, she sexy for the weekend
