[Verse 1]
And I ain't know why I fuck with you (Oh, oh)
Gonna end up falling in love with you (Oh, yeah)
It's the type of shit you expose me to (Oh, oh)
Then I pulled up side by side in my Mercеdes coupe (Oh, yeah)
Ain't nobody got you likе I got you
We move higher and higher, you see what really matters
Ain't nobody got you like I got you
I been touchin' a bag and climbin' the ladder

Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Oh, oh)

Take me to your crib and we can party all night (Oh, oh, take me, we can)
Let's do it, baby (Oh, yeah, let's do it)
Let's do it tonight (Let's do it)

[Verse 2]
Shawty once sat in my lap and said, "You hard", it's just the steel (Yeah)
Shawty once heard my voice and then she started catchin' feels
She wiped down the bowl to get her grip and clap her heels (Yeah)
I can't see my feet, paint the room with dollar bills
So what's there to do? (Oh, oh)
I'm in a mood (Oh, yeah)
Don't stop vibin' (Yeah, yeah), keep it cool
Made you revenue (Oh, oh)
Baby, what's the move? (Oh, yeah, what's your move?)

Don't give up on your purpose
In the strip club, but you're still workin'
Feel like you're runnin' in circles, I know what your worth is

[Chorus]
Baby, you can do it, take your time, do it right (Oh, oh)
You can do it, baby, do it tonight (Oh, yeah)
You can take me to your crib, you can ride it all ni— (Oh, oh)
You can do it, baby, do it to (Oh, yeah, do it to)

[Outro]
And I ain't know why I fuck with you (Oh, oh)
Gonna end up falling in love with you (Oh, yeah)
It's the type of shit you expose me to (Oh, oh)
Then I pulled up side by side in my Mercedes coupe (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't nobody got you like I got you (Oh, oh)
We move higher and higher, you see what really matters (Oh, yeah)
Ain't nobody got you like I got you (Oh, oh)
I been touchin' a bag and climbin' the ladder (Oh, yeah)Embed
