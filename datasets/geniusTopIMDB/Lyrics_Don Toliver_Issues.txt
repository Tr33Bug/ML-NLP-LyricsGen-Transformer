Issues Lyrics[Chorus]
You got issues, you got issues (uh)
I can't deal with you, you got issues (shit)
You wanna talk, and you wanna cry, now you need a tissue
You got issues, you got issues (damn)
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna think about it (nah)
I don't need you around me, you got issues (shit)
And you wanna play, and you wanna fuck and say I dissed you
You got issues (damn), you got issues

[Verse 1]
Stay up out my business, you and all your bitches (haha)
Y'all be always talkin', y'all be always dissin' (yeah)
When I'm comin' through, you be always trippin' (please)
Talkin' to me like I'm wrong, like I said something to you (yeah, yeah)
Get out my face, I'm out my bag (skrt)
I run it up fast (skrt), lil shawty got ass (yeah)
But she's some trouble, she work at double double
She argue 'bout the rent and 'bout the bills with no rebuttal
Stop talkin', I'm in my crib, it's the studio, the office
And yeah, you botherin'
I'ma let you go, let you do your own thing
I don't need the headache, I don't need the pain
[Chorus]
You got issues, you got issues (uh)
I can't deal with you, you got issues (shit)
You wanna talk, and you wanna cry, now you need a tissue
You got issues, you got issues (damn)
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna think about it (nah)
I don't need you around me, you got issues (shit)
And you wanna play, and you wanna fuck and say I dissed you
You got issues (damn), you got issues

[Verse 2]
Now you talkin' 'bout you want me back, huh (want me back)
I can't fuck around and go and deal with that, huh (deal with that)
You be in and out my house, I blow your back, huh (I blow your back)
Yeah you gotta speak the truth, cut my heart out, yeah, yeah
Switch lanes on a bitch who wanna change on me (yeah)
I'm 'bout the gang, yeah, I'm playin' with the 'caine, homie
Back then, they ain't want me (uh), she suck me up, she all on me
Backed by that money, now turn around and show me some
I started two tone, I got it too glowin', call me Young Donny, I'm smokin' too strong
Now that's the strand, I'm poppin' bands, me, you and your man, yeah

[Chorus]
You got issues, you got issues (uh)
I can't deal with you, you got issues (shit)
You wanna talk, and you wanna cry, now you need a tissue
You got issues, you got issues (damn)
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna think about it (nah)
I don't need you around me, you got issues (shit)
And you wanna play, and you wanna fuck and say I dissed you
You got issues (damn), you got issues
