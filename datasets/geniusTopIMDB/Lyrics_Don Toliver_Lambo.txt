Lambo Lyrics[Intro]
Pooh, you a fool for this one
You a fool for this, go Grizz
Go Grizz
Winners Circle

[Chorus]
Pulled out the Lambo, I'm strapped like commando
Play her like a banjo, trap out the bando
Is you fucking? I'm just sayin', though
You know I ain't playin', ho (Trap)
Jack gave me that Antidote, juiced up, cantaloupe
Pulled out the Lambo, I'm strapped like commando
Play her like a banjo, trap out the bando
Is you fucking? I'm just sayin', though
You know I ain't playin', ho (Trap)
Jack gave me that Antidote, juiced up, cantaloupe
[Verse 1]
I know what you want, I know what you want
You gotta come through and get it (Yeah)
I'm runnin' through hundreds, getting this money
Finna flip me a chicken (Huh?)
In hot Popeyes, stir-fry when I whip in the kitchen (Yeah)
Got your bitch on duty, backin' up as she doin' the dishes (Woah)
Thick bitch, big booty, keep a duty like you seen in a movie
It's a Jeep, not a dually, lift it up and I'm keepin' a toolie
I'm riding 'round the block, bumpin' 'round servin' the 'cane
I'm prayin' to my Glock, I know that you know it by name
An ex-pill fiend, them Xannies kept me sane
I feel like Superman, I'm fuckin' Lois Lane
Put her on a knee, I put her in her place
I put it in her mouth, Picasso on her face

[Chorus]
Pulled out the Lambo, I'm strapped like commando
Play her like a banjo, trap out the bando
Is you fucking? I'm just sayin', though
You know I ain't playin', ho (Trap)
Jack gave me that Antidote, juiced up, cantaloupe
Pulled out the Lambo, I'm strapped like commando
Play her like a banjo, trap out the bando
Is you fucking? I'm just sayin', though
You know I ain't playin', ho (Trap)
Jack gave me that Antidote, juiced up, cantaloupe

You can't really hide, just pretend you're dead
You've been out of line, you're beside yourself
You can't come around, got that beam all-red
Caught my nigga B, he would rob for that bread, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Ran down on that bitch, see how I'll bag her (Huh, huh), yeah
M.I.A., juicin' all that ass up (Fat ass), yeah
Playin' 'round with the dawgs, yeah, that's bad luck (Grr), yeah
When I switched up my ride, they couldn't stand us (Hah), yeah
Live with it, all you niggas gotta deal with it (Nigga)
Young nigga, I'm still with it (Shit)
Call up my phone, got my 9 and I drill with it (Huh)
I keep that tool like I'm Bob, I'm gon' build with it (Huh)
Show you what's real with it (Huh)
Young nigga in the field with it (Huh)

[Chorus]
Pulled out the Lambo, I'm strapped like commando
Play her like a banjo, trap out the bando
Is you fucking? I'm just sayin', though
You know I ain't playin', ho (Trap)
Jack gave me that Antidote, juiced up, cantaloupe
Pulled out the Lambo, I'm strapped like commando
Play her like a banjo, trap out the bando
Is you fucking? I'm just sayin', though
You know I ain't playin', ho (Trap)
Jack gave me that Antidote, juiced up, cantaloupe2Embed
