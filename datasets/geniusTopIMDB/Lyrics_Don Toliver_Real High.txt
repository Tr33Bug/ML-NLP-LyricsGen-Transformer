Real High Lyrics[Intro: Don Toliver]
It's estimated
I can tell you're infatuated
I can tell you're investigating
We can talk about it at the destination, destination, yeah

[Segue]
Take-take-take-take-take-take-take-take
One-one-one-one-one-one-one-one-one
Take-take-take-take-take-take-take-take
One-one-one-one-onе-one-one-one-onе
[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Been feelin' that heat all day
I need love, better than shade
Do what Simon say
Bend over and touch your legs
Cr-crashed on all my meds
God dammit, I need my bread (Bread)
On the verge of jumpin' that ledge

[Bridge: Don Toliver]
I'm lovin' the way that you doin' your thing, I'm lovin' the way that you talk
Sittin' you down, layin' you down, know that your mind´s on the wok
Sippin' it down, way, way down, I know that my mind´s on the wok
Come hate me now, what about now? I know you love to talk

[Verse: Don Toliver]
Two piece, comin' outside, ayy (Know she finna get high)
Tell me if you finna get live today (Know you finna get live)
I don't wanna go ride the Wraith (I can't take no ride)
I can't take no ride, I can't take no ride
Runnin' them racks like a relay, get it on eBay
Eat it up clean like a cheesecake, don't listen what he or she say
Oh, that's your nigga? He a cheapskate, God damn (Damn), oh Pete's sake (Aw)
She lookin' at him like he fake, she lookin' at him like he fake

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Been feelin' that heat all day
I need love, better than shade
Do what Simon say
Bend over and touch your legs
Cr-crashed on all my meds
God dammit, I need my bread (Bread)
On the verge of jumpin' that ledge

I walk atop the mountain like a dragon, I was feelin' real high
I walk atop the mountain like a dragon, I was feelin' real high
