TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsSwangin’ on Westheimer Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't put me in a box now
I'm by myself, yeah, I'm on lockdown
Sometimes you gotta find
What's wrong and what's right
It's been a long road here comin'
Blue hundreds, I'm thumbing
And I could split the whole damn thing with my woman
What's yours is mine
I'll say it again, what's yours is mine
Don't leave the house, baby
You gotta swing my way, but don't believe the hype, babe
I'm movin' shady so don't believe the hype, baby
I might lie sometimes, don't believe the hype, babe
[Chorus]
We're going 'til five in the morning, I caught you yawning, oh yeah
I guess it can't get no easy, I know you need me
I guess I'm gon' ride your wave, I'll do you a favor, yeah
I know it can't get no easy, I know you need me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm two or three shots, I'm catchin' up
She off the Henny and tequila, no catchin' her
The way she move her body, man, I swear I'm attached to her
Don't make me sing this here song
And I went and made it out on my own
You call me later when you're all alone
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
We're going 'til five in the morning, I caught you yawning, oh yeah
I guess it can't get no easy, I know you need me
I guess I'm gon' ride your wave, I'll do you a favor, yeah
I know it can't get no easy, I know you need me, yeah

[Verse 3]
I gotta live my life, but I swear I'm seeing too much
And I'm think about where I am, and I know just where I was
I had decided to take you back to the H to keep you there ballin'
You done learned some language on ya, I wanna go fallin'
You been posted at the Post Oak and I got evidence
Pulled off my car, I left my residence
I need gas light and you smell the shit
At a red light, inhalin' it
And the cops behind, they tellin' it
And the way that I pull up late, I might as well sell this shit
No outweighin' my love, ain't no scalin' it
She wanna take a dose, uh-uh-uh, go and inhale this shit
She wanna take a dose, uh-uh-uh, go and inhale this shit

I guess it can't get no easy, I know you need me
I guess I'm gon' ride your wave, I'll do you a favor, yeah
I know it can't get no easy, I know you need me, yeah

[Outro]
Know I'm here for a good time
I don't wanna go to sleep, babe
I just wanna ride around town
Know I'm here for a good time
I just wanna get you down and out in the wild
I don't wanna go to sleep, babe
I just wanna ride around town5Embed
