Talk No More Lyrics[Intro]
RamyOnTheBeat
Ayy, Ramy, light up another blunt, bruh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more, no)
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more)
Been a long time since you came around and you called my phone
Now you settled down, you ain't playin' around, and you comin' home, nah, nah, nah
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more, no)
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more)
Been a long time since you came around and you called my phone
Now you settled down, you ain't playin' around, and you comin' home, nah, nah, nah
[Verse 1]
I saved you, way back, hey Jack
'Rari, speed past, shoot, I'm like Steve Nash
Bitch, I'm sorry, faked and you played me, betrayed me
Now I'm strong, I don't need you, ho, you can save that
Pulled around on fanny, I was fuckin' around with a dancer
And I didn't open the door and my old lady ain't know
It's play 'til I die, and this play 'til I go
I'm finna rent a vacation home, work hard till you can't work no more
Mad about this and we argue about that
And even though I was gettin' money, you'd complain about my trap
And the same thing I was goin' through, you gon' feel that right back
And you conversation is bullshit, and your perfume is wack

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more, no)
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more)
Been a long time since you came around and you called my phone
Now you settled down, you ain't playin' around, and you comin' home, nah, nah, nah
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more, no)
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more)
Been a long time since you came around and you called my phone
Now you settled down, you ain't playin' around, and you comin' home, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 2]
You've been gone some time now, you should stay away (Yeah)
I don't like your attitude, get it out my face
Longitude and latitude, I'm movin' out my space
You knowin' that I'm mad at you, you do it anyway
She a eater (Yeah), bustin' out the backdoor (Uh-huh)
I'm trappin', you get what you asked for (Uh), I get it in with no passport (Uh)
That's a pack in that Jansport, hopped in that Jag Sport
Bad bitch, ain't average, but damn sure I will ignore
Tell me somethin' or tell me nothin'
You come around town like you always stuntin' (Yeah)
Pulled up in that blue Jeep in your driveway, like "beep beep" (Yeah, yeah)
Comin' down that boulevard, shootin' niggas like Chief Keef (Uh-huh)

I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more, no)
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more)
Been a long time since you came around and you called my phone
Now you settled down, you ain't playin' around, and you comin' home, nah, nah, nah
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more, no)
I don't wanna talk no more, we don't need to talk no more (No more)
Been a long time since you came around and you called my phone
Now you settled down, you ain't playin' around, and you comin' home, nah, nah, nah2Embed
