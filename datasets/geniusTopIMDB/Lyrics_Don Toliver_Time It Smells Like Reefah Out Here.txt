Time (It Smells Like Reefah Out Here) Lyrics[Intro]
"Excuse me, is that reefer I smell?"
"No sir."
"Uh uh, don't lie to an old man, boy it ain't right. You selfish bastards. Y'all gon' stand out here and smoke a joint and ain't gon' ask old man if he want a hit?"
"You want a hit old man?"
"Do a crack whore's pussy stank? Hahaha, I'm a drug addict son, I always want a hit."

[Chorus]
She love me, she on my line
I don't want her for the whole damn time
I just want her for the one damn night
Saint Laurent mask with the old school Nike
I see you over there lil' shawty you fine
Take her to the crib, fuck a wine with the dine
[Verse 1]
But yeah I'm comin' back, I'm runnin' up a check, baby
You see me comin' through, I'm pullin' in a 'Vette, baby
I know you want to have love, have sex, baby
I know, I know you wanna ride with the real, baby

[Bridge]
But I gotta tell a lie, safehouse my spy
Two-tone that's a drug, I'm pouring an eight, it straight drop
Got my wrist on Chris Rock, diamonds make you do the criss cross
I'm in my trap with a banger, I'm smokin' a wood a fanger (Yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm a dog
I'm smokin' weed I got my alcohol
If I, if I don't answer my phone then don't call (I-I, I-I)
I don't want you in my life you not involved, yeah

[Chorus]
She love me, she on my line
I don't want her for the whole damn time
I just want her for the one damn night
Saint Laurent mask with the old school Nike
I see you over there lil' shawty you fine
Take her to the crib, fuck a wine with the dine

[Chorus]
She love me, she on my line
I don't want her for the whole damn time
I just want her for the one damn night
Saint Laurent mask with the old school Nike
I see you over there lil' shawty you fine
Take her to the crib, fuck a wine with the dineEmbed
