Video Girl Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, ah
Oh, woah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Sexy when we touchin', screamin' loud, we fuckin'
I know you know my name, I scratched that off my bucket list
You scratchin' on my back, yeah, you tryna leave them cuts and shit
Freaky lil old thang, you don't know who you fuckin' with
[Chorus]
Yo, be my video girl, dance sexy for me
Do it like you got Hennessy, do it like we got chemistry
Video girl, rub all on me
I know you got you a man, but do it with no apology

[Verse 2]
Video girl, call me in the mornin'
Call me when you horny, fresh off work and you want it
My video girl, I know you a freak take this meat
Do it just like you love and you care (ay, ay)
I ride in a Lotus, huh, my gun stay loaded
I let it explode (bah)
But on the right one imma talk my shit
Lil shawty, yeah she want the dick
Eat it over the counter, now she tell her friends 'bout her freaky shit

[Chorus]
Yo, be my video girl, dance sexy for me
Do it like you got Hennessy, do it like we got chemistry
Video girl, rub all on me
I know you got you a man, but do it with no apology

[Verse 3]
Be my video girl, video girl
Like a movie special at a all time high
Like a video credit that didn't go wrong
Like you stuck to the script all along
Tell me you want a ride, I got a Jeep gassed up, sittin' outside
Four by four rollin' all the times
Comin' up to here, but you know I'm comin' down
Go ahead, climb up in it, uh, ride up in it, uh, ride up in it
Just let me slide up in it, uh, dive up in it, uh, don't hide that kitty, uh
You might also like[Chorus]
Yo, be my video girl, dance sexy for me
Do it like you got Hennessy, do it like we got chemistry
Video girl, rub all on me
I know you got you a man, but do it with no apology

[Outro]
