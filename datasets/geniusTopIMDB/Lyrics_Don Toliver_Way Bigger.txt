TranslationsPortuguÃªsWay Bigger Lyrics[Intro]
I got base but it hit way bigger (Woah-woah)
Jet ski slide but the waves way bigger

[Chorus]
Goyard bag but it hit way bigger (Yeah, yeah)
Pour that deuce in my lemonade, nigga (Yeah)
Can't get off if it ain't six figures
Shawty ran off with a rich ass nigga (Woah)
Paid my dues in the streets, I'm litty
With a bad bitch through the whole pandemic (Yeah, yeah)
Lemme hit the hole through the whole ninth inning
Eatin' and beatin' the whole night swimmin' (Ha)
[Post-Chorus]
Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh (Woo, ooh, ooh)
Woah, woah, oh-oh (Woo, ooh)
Woah, woah, oh-oh (Woo, ooh)

In heat, like sauna
I'm blowin' marijuana (Geet, geet)
Don't judge me here, your honor (Yeah)
She keep it on her
At least a hunna
She spend it if she wanna
She flocky, that's my guala (Flocky)
Yeah

Smash on the gas and the bitch can't get up
Lambo' truck and a bitch came with her (Yeah)
Too much money, got shit to get rid of (Woo)
Lay your head down, let me get it in a sit up (Yeah)
A one time call went down, Vice City (Woah, woah)
Going against the grain, I pity (Woah, woah)
Hundreds of bands of cash, it's litty
Rockin' her off that Wock' (Wock')
Split it with the fam, I want to
Count a couple M's and run through
Blue, blue cash and thumb through (Blue, blue cash)
Thumb through, thumb through
My eyes red, I'm turnin' up

Need Visine in that 'Rari
Need that lean, oh, yeah-yeah
