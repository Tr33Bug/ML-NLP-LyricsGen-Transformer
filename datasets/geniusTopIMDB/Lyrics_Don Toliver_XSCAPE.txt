TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsXSCAPE Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, you the one I want
No, I can't lie, you the one I want (Yeah)
Say what it is, keep it blunt
New girl for the month, picked right out the bunch (Yeah)

[Chorus]
And I know that it gets old and it gets cold (Yeah)
Just pull up and when you're outside, hit me for the gate code
Did a lot to keep you guessin'
Finally realized that he put you second (Yeah)
'Cause you heartbroke, but you learned your lesson
Been a long time, but you still get sexy
[Verse 1]
But, yeah, you still got it
Always askin' "What you doin'?", tell 'em take you shoppin' (Yeah)
If hе don't do it for you, baby, get a different option
Got you comin' out thе crib and he ain't comin' out of pocket
How long that's gon' take?
Know you just wanna escape (Yeah)
Know you just want a break
But, girl, you gotta embrace, yeah

[Chorus]
And I know that it gets old and it gets cold (Yeah)
Just pull up and when you're outside, hit me for the gate code
Did a lot to keep you guessin'
Finally realized that he put you second (Yeah)
'Cause you heartbroke, but you learned your lesson
Been a long time, but you still get sexy

[Verse 2]
Still get sexy, call my phone or text me, yeah
It's about that time to come roll out (Yeah, yeah)
Ridin' so long, bound for a blowout (Ooh)
Do your dance, she love to show out (Yeah, yeah)
You're goin' crazy, ain't know but I know now (Yeah)
Uh, let me pull up later
Show you how I'm rockin', do you all a favor
Ooh (Do it again, yeah), ooh (Do it again, oh, my, uh-huh)
