Doolin-Dalton/Desperado (reprise) Lyrics
Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
"All you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to
Find your seats?"
Watch 'em duelin' (duelin')
Doolin-Dalton (Dalton)
High or low, (high, low), it's all the same
Easy money and faithless women
You will never kill the pain
Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why
Sooner or later we all have to die?
Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
Four men ride out and only three ride back

The queen of diamonds let you down
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out
And it's fin'lly turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado
(Is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow
(Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust
(Maybe tomorrow)
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
