Hollywood Waltz Lyrics
Springtime, and the acacias are blooming
Southern California will see one more day
Dreamland, and bus'ness is booming
The birds are a singing as I drift away

She looks another year older
From too many lovers who used her and ran
But some nights, oh, she looks like an angel
And she's always willing to hold you again
So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz

Springtime and the lady is grieving
The lovers just stand there with nothing to say
They got what they wanted
They're packing and leaving
To look for another to love the same way

So give her this dance
She can't be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than she's taken
And I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz
