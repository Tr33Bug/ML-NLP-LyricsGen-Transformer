My Man Lyrics
Tell me , how do you feel?
Like you're rolling so fast that you're spinning your wheels?
Don't feel too bad, you're not all along
We're all trying to get along
With everybody else trying to go their way
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say?
Just go along until they turn out the lights
There's nothing we can do to fight it

No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain
And we who must remain go on living just the same
I once knew a man, very talented guy
He's sing for the people and people would cry
They knew that his song came from deep down inside
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes
And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind
Called him home


We who must remain go on laughing just the sameYou might also like2Embed
