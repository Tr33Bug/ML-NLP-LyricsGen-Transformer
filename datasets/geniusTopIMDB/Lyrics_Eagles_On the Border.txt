On the Border Lyrics
Cruising down the center of a two way street
Wondering who is really in the driver's seat
Minding my business along comes big brother
Says, son, you better get on one side or the other

I'm out on the border, i'm walking the line
Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine
After a hard day, i'm safe at home
Fooling with my baby on the telephone
Out of nowhere somebody cuts in and
Says, "hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been."

I'm out on the border, I thought this was a private line
Don't you tell me about your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

Never mind your name, just give us your number, mm
Never mind your face, just show us your card, mm
And we wanna know whose wing are you under
You better step to the right or we can make it hard

I'm stuck on the border
All I wanted was some peace of mind
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm trying to change this water to wine

On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border
Leave me be , i'm just walking this line
On the border
On the border
All i wanted was some peace of mind, peace of mind
I'm out on the border
On the border
Can't you see i'm trying to change this water to wine
On the border
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
Sick and tired of all your law and order
On the border
Sick and tired of it
On the border
I'm the man on the border
