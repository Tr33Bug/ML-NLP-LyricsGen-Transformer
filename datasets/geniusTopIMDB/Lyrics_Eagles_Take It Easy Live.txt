Take It Easy (Live) LyricsWell, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy
Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Southern California
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
But we will never be here again so open up, I'm climbin' in take it easy
Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Well you know we got it easy
We outta take it easy, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
