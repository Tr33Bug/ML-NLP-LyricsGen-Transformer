Witchy Woman Lyrics
Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her fingertips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye
She held me spellbound in the night (Woo-ooh)
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room (Woo-ooh)
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye


Ah, oh ah ah (Waahaa)
Ah, oh ah ah (Waahaa)
Ah, oh ah ah
Ah, oh ah ah (Waahaa)
Ah, oh ah ah (Waahaa)
Ah, oh ah ah

Well, I know you want a lover, let me tell you brother
She's been sleeping in the devil's bed
And there's some rumors going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the night time 'til your skin turns red
You might also like
Woo hoo, witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo, witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye9Embed
