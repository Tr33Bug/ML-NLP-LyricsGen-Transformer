And Love Goes On LyricsI would be so willing
To give you all I got
You're a special lady
Forget me not
I could be so tender
For the likes of you
Let my heart surrender
And love goes on (And love goes on)
On and on (On and on)
Your heart beats strong (Heart beats strong)
As love goes on (Yeah)
Everyday I'm wishing
For that day to come
Feeling superstitious
Hoping she's the one
One day I am lonely
Next with plenty smiles
Love I find amusing
And love goes on (Love goes on)
On and on (On and on)
Your heart beats strong (Heart beats strong)
As love goes on (Love)
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, and
If we can't work it out
You should know without a doubt
I will always be the one
You can turn to
A friend until the end
No matter where we've been
Sometimes you can't hold on
You got to give it space, yeah, yeah
Baby, we can work it out
Yes, I really love you
And without a doubt
I can make you happy
Plant good memories
That will last forever

On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on
Love's tender
And with you in mind
Now my heart surrenders
Just to make you mine
Baby, baby, baby
What 'cha gonna do?
Give your heart to me
I'll give my heart to you
And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on
And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes onEmbed
