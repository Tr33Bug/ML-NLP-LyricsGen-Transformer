Be Ever Wonderful LyricsBe ever wonderful, ahh, alright
Stay as you are
Time is right for you tonight
Find your place among the broad day light
Stay as you are, alright, oh
And be ever, be ever wonderful, ahh, alright
Stay as you are, alright, alright
Gonna find a few (who will) always walk with you, ow, baby
Many people claim, don't always view the same, aw, baby
As you live today, what I wanna say
Is be ever wonderful in your own sweet way
Be ever, be ever wonderful, ahh
Stay as you are, alright
Time is right in your life tonight
Find your place in the broad day light, yeah
Ooo, stay as you are
'Cause what I wanna do, and what I'd like to tell you
May not be as you see
As you live today, what I wanna say
Is be ever wonderful in your own sweet way
Don't let the world change your mind
Don't let the world change your mind, change your mind...You might also like2Embed
