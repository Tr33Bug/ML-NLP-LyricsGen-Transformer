Canâ€™t Let Go LyricsLove that's born in truth
All the doubt removed
Lover's eyes are blessed
Only see the best
I can't let go
Of a love that grows
You're my woman, baby, love
You know I love you so
Empty hearts are free
Bring your love to me
Soul chase the moon, oh babe
Shadows hug the room
Turn off the light
Sneak in bed at night
Darkness shuts its eyes, baby
I open mine to you
I can't let go of a love that grows
You know I love you so
Oh woah oh oh
Can't let go, know I love you so
I can't let go
Of a love that grows
You're my woman, baby love
You know I love you so
I love you so, I
I love you, oh
I can't let go
Of a love that grows (Of a love that grows)
You're my woman, baby, love
You know I love you so
I can't let go (Can't let go)
Of a love that grows
You're my woman, baby, love
You know I love you so

Of a love that grows (Of a love that grows)
You're my woman, baby, love
You know I love you so
I can't let go (I can't let go)
Of a love that grows (Of a love that grows)
You're my woman, baby, love
You know I love you soEmbed
