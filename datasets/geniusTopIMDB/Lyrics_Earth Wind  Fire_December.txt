December Lyrics
Do you remember the 25th night of December?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin' in the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember?
How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah

Hey, hey, hey!
Ba-dee ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee ya, dancin' in December
Ba-dee ya, never was a cloudy day
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda

My thoughts are with you, holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love, remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember
The true love we share today

Hey, hey, hey!
Ba-dee ya, say, do you remember?
Ba-dee ya, dancin' in December
Ba-dee ya, never was a cloudy day
There was a...

Ba-dee ya, (dee ya dee ya) golden dreams were shiny days

The bells were ringin', oh oh
Our souls were singin'
