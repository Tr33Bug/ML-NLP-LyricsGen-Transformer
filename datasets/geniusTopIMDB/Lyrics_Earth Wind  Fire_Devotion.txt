Devotion LyricsThrough devotion
Blessed are the children
Praise the teacher
That brings true love to many
Your devotion
Opens all life's treasures, yeah
And deliverance
From the fruits of evil
So our mission
To bring a melody
Ringin' voices (woo hoo, hoo)
Sing sweet harmony
For you here's a song
To make your day brighter
One that will last you long
Through troubled days
Giving your heart, ooh
The light to brighten
Oh, oh, oh, all of the dark
That falls in your way
You need devotion
Bless the children, whoa
Deliverance
From the fruits of evil
In everyone's life
There's a need to be happy, yeah
Let the sun shine
A smile your way
Open your heart
Feel the touch of devotion
Maybe this song
Will help uplift your day
Make a better way
