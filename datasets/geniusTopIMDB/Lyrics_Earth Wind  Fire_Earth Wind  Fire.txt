Earth, Wind & Fire LyricsAre you satisfied in your life and time?
Does it clear you mind, all the hurt you find?
Built on Mother Earth
And were meant to stay
Nations bloom today
On gifts of yesterday
Born of the Earth are nature's children
Fed by the Wind, the breath of life
Judged by the Fiery hands of God
World moves by the hand of the master plan
Can't you understand you're but a grain of sand?
Do you need a guide to make you feel satisfied?
Head to the sky will tell you why
Born of the Earth are nature's children
Fed by the Wind, the breath of life
Judged by the Fiery hands of God
Do you need a guide, make you feel satisfied?
Can you understand you're but a grain of sand?
When you search the sky, does it make you cry?
Ohhh, do you understand ain't nothin' but a big ol' man?You might also likeEmbed
