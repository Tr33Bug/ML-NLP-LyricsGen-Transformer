Guiding Lights LyricsCome and tell us your fears
We can get your mind clear
Put your hands in, you'll understand
When your soul's sense is clean
Insights line up your dreams
See the symbols to know the plan
If you breathe in the Love
You become one of us
If you draw from the root
You'll blossom the truth
Don't fly, we're flown
Don't reach, we're grown
Life's not your own
We're not alone
Don't fly, we're flown
Don't reach, we're grown
Life's not your own
We're not alone
If you're looking for the life that's in you (whatchu do?)
And you tryna figure how you gon' do
Let the Guiding Lights take ya
Ooooooo!
Taste your situation
Digest confirmation
Feed your needs and be in health
Vibe with Life's frequencies
Ancestors speak in themes
Work in seasons to learn yourself
Feel our whole energy
All our soul's symmetries
So keep your head to the sky
And let the clouds tell you why
You might also likeDon't fly, we're flown
Don't reach, we're grown
Life's not your own
We're not alone
Don't fly, we're flown
Don't reach, we're grown
Life's not your own
We're not alone
If you're looking for the life that's in you (whatchu do?)
And you tryna figure how you gon' do
Let the Guiding Lights take ya
Take you away
Take you awayEmbed
