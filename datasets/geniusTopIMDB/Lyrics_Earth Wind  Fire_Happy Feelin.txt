Happy Feelinâ€™ Lyrics
Feelin'
Happy feelin'
In the music
That we're givin'
Feel the power
Of the hour
Every moment
That you're livin'

Little babies
Tell the story
Mother Nature
And its glory
Share the feelin'
With your brother
Don't stop carin'
One another
There's a reason
That we're pleasin'
What you're yearnin'
Life's a-burnin'

Aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah

Feelin'
Happy feelin'
Happy feelin'
