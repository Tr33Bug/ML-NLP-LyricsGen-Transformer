Iâ€™ll Write a Song for You LyricsI thirst but never quench
I know the consequence, feeling as I do
We're in a spinning top
Where, tell me, will it stop?
And what am I to say?
Open our music book, that only few can look
And I'll write a song for you
Love is a symphony, hearts in one melody
'Cause I'll write a song for you
Sounds never dissipate
They only recreate in another place
There's in your silent night
Joy of a song's delight
'Cause I'll write a song for you
You'll write a song for me
We'll write a song of love, of love
My magical mystique
Finding it all complete
In your lovely face
Feelings we try to chase
Memories that won't erase
Stay forever new
We have a magic box in which is never locked
'Cause I'll write a song for you
You'll write a song for me
We'll write a song of love, of love, yeah
We write a song of love, my baby
Write a song of love
(You, for you, you, for you, you, you)
We have a magic box
We write a song of love
We write, write a song of love
Sounds, they never dissipate
They only recreate
To another place or time
We write a song, we write a song
Just you and me, baby

We write a song
We write a song
We write a songEmbed
