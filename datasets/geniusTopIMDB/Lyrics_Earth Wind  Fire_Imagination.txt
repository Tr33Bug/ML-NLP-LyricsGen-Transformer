Imagination LyricsMagic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see?
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody
So, I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do?
It's not hard to conceive
Love's ecstasy imagining you and me
Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
Ooo, and that morning light is you
So, I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do?
It's not hard to conceive
Love's ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see
You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make real my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me
So, I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination will do?
It's not hard to conceive
Love's ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can seeYou might also likeEmbed
