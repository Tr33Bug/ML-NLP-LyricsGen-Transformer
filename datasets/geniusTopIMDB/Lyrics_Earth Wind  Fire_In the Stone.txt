In the Stone LyricsI found that love provides the key
Unlocks the heart and souls of you and me
Love will learn to sing your song, yeah
Love is written in the stone
Every man I meet is walking time
Free to wander past his conscious mind
Love will come and take you home, yeah
Love is written in the stone
Do you believe, my friend in what you claim
People of the world all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own, yeah
Truth is, truth is written in the stone
In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone, the light is shining
Ever touching all
Life experience a passing day
Time will witness what the old folks say
Getting stronger every day
Strength is, strength is written in the stone
Deep inside your heart for you to keep
Lies a spark of light that never sleeps
The greatest love you ever known
Love is, love is written in the stone
In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone, the light is shining
Ever touching all
Never, never, my darling
Never you'll be alone
Never, never, my darling
Never you'll be alone
Ever, forever, my darling
True love is written in the stone
You might also likeNever, never, my darling
Never you'll be alone
Ever, forever, my darling
True love is written in the stone
Never, never, my darling
Never you'll be alone
Ever, forever, my darling....1Embed
