Let Your Feelings Show Lyrics

(He-he-he, hooh-oh-oh)

Woke up Sunday morning
Feeling out of tune
Wrapped my eyes around you
Love came in the room
Babe (Babe)
Gonna let my feelings show (Gonna let my feelings show)
Everyday (Everyday), gonna learn to love you more (Haha)

Laughing into midnight
Lover be my guide
We approach the morning
Feeling good inside
Baby (Aw man)
Gonna let my feelings show (Gonna let my feelings show)
Everyday (Yeah-yeah), gonna learn to love you more (Huh)

Paying dues and changes
Living day to day
Love is necessary
To help you find the way

Baby
Gonna let my feelings show (Gonna let my feelings show)
Everyday (Everyday)

Start not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care, you must dare
To be free as the air (Air)
You might also like
Fairy tales and stories
That we fail to see
We will tell the story
Our reality

Babe (Babe)
Gonna let my feelings show (Gonna let my feelings show)
Everyday, gonna learn to love you more

Tingle in our heartbeat
Rapture on the cloud
Softer words are spoken
Action speak out loud

Baby
Gonna let my feelings show (Gonna let my feelings show)
Everyday (Everyday)

Start not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care, you must dare
To be free as the air
