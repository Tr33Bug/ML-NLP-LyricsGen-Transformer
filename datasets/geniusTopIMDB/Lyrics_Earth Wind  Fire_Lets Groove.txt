Letâ€™s Groove Lyrics
We can boogie down, down up on down
The boogie sound, down up on down
The boogie sound, down up on down
The boogie sound, down up on down

Let's groove tonight (down down upon down)
Share the spice of life
(The boogie sound, down upon down)
Baby, slice it right
(The boogie sound, down upon down)
We're gonna groove tonight
(The boogie sound, down upon down)
Let this groove get you to move
It's alright, alright, alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up, alright, alright

Gonna tell you what you can do with my love
Alright
Let you know, girl
You're looking good, you're out of sight
Alright
Just move yourself and glide like a 747
And lose yourself in the sky
Among the clouds in the heavens, gods

Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright, alright, alright (Uh-oh-uh)
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up, alright, alright

Let me tell ya what you can do with my love
Alright
Gotta let you know, girl
You're looking good, you're out of sight
Alright
Just tell the DJ to play your favorite tune
Then you know it's okay
What you found is happening now
You might also like
Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright, alright, alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (Stand up), alright, alright
Let this groove get you to move
It's alright, alright, alright (Yeah)
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up, alright, alright

You will find peace of mind on the floor
Take a little time
Come and see, you and me
Give a little sign
I'll be there, after a while
If you want my love
We can boogie on down
Down, boogie on down (The boogie sound, down upon down)
Down, boogie on down (The boogie sound, down upon down)
Down, we boogie on down (The boogie sound, down upon down)
On down (The boogie sound, down upon down)

Let's groove tonight (The boogie sound, down upon down)
Share the spice of life (The boogie sound, down upon down)
Baby, slice it right (The boogie sound, down upon down)
We're gonna groove tonight (The boogie sound, down upon down)
Uh-oh-uh

Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright, alright, alright (Uh-oh-uh)
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (Alright), alright, alright

Let this groove get you to move (We're gonna groove tonight)
It's alright, alright, alright (Share the spice of life)
Let this groove set in your shoes (Baby, slice it right)
So stand up, alright, alright (Just start the groove tonight)
