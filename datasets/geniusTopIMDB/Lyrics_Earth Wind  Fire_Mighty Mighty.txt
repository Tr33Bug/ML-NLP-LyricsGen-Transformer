Mighty Mighty LyricsWalk around, why wear a frown?
Say little people, try to put you down
What you need, a helpin' hand
All the strength, at your command
How's ya faith? 'Cause ya faith is you
Who you kiddin'? To yourself be true
Spread ya love, for a brighter day
For what ya search, you'll find a way
We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run from
Eagles fly, every seven days
Still cryin' the blues, all about ya pay
What ya gonna do 'bout your living thang?
Will ya make it better, or just complain?
Every day is real, don't run from fear
'Cause better days are very near
There are times when you're bound to cry
One more time, head to the sky
We are people, of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you can't run fromYou might also likeEmbed
