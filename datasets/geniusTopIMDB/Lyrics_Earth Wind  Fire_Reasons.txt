Reasons Lyrics
Now, I'm craving your body, is this real
Temperature's rising, I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
And I'm longing to love you just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
With all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la

After all our reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all our reasons, love
Love was left aside

I'm longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baby
Ooh, baby


Yeah, reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear
And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade
You might also like
And, in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
Find our reasons, our reasons, our reasons
Had no pride

After all our reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all our reasons, love
Love was left aside

Yeah, where, yeah where, ooh, baby
I can't find the reasons
That my love won't disappear
Can't find the reasons
Why I love you, baby, my dear
Can't find the reasons
Wanna love you all night
Can't find the reasons
Gotta squeeze ya, real tight
Can't find the reasons
Baby, yeah
For my tears
Can't find the reasons
Why I love ya3Embed
