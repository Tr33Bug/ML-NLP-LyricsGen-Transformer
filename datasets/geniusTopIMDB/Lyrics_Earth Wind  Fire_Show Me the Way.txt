Show Me the Way Lyrics
Hey Raphael, this is Maurice callin'
Just callin' to find out what time you
Wanna get together today with the horns

See I don't want to come out too confident
I've traveled many roads but none quite as smooth as this
'Cause you are picturesque like the morning sun
So close I think I can touch you, yet the distance is so far
And I am open wide and vulnerable
Wherever you wanna take me girl, I'm so down to go

Just show me, yeah (show me the way to your heart)
I won't let go
I promise to protect you, life's taught me many lessons
Just show me, yeah (show me the way to your heart)
I won't let go
These feelings I'm possessing can never be neglected

Time don't exist when I'm with you
I lose myself in wondering if you feel it too
'Cause I feel like dancing on the moon
Every time I look down, I see the light in you, yeah

And you, you, are like the missing part of me
I never knew that I was hollow until you filled me
And girl, I'm closing my eyes, now take my hand
And lead me to the part of you that made me a better man

Just show me, yeah (show me the way to your heart)
I won't let go
I promise to protect you, life's taught me many lessons
Just show me, yeah (show me the way to your heart)
I won't let go
These feelings I'm possessing can't never be neglected
Just show me, yeaaah

You see love just happened to be a beautiful thing
And you see, some choose to disagree
And some choose to look the other way
Love is a divine power
Sing along with Maurice y'all, come on

Oh ooh oh, (show me the way to your heart), oh ooh oh

Baby, your love is so precious to me, child

Oh ooh oh, (show me the way to your heart), oh ooh oh

Baby, the heavens leased your soul to me, child
If you can find a place (show me the way to your heart)
Somewhere in your heart, baby
Come on baby, come on baby
Your love is so precious to me
I feel the time is here (show me the way to your heart)
Show me your biggest heart, baby
Come on lady, come on lady
(Your love is so precious to me)
Show me the love, the mystery
Take me back to honesty
I need to feel your light so we can love in harmony
Show me the light, your brightest star
Gimme your hand, let's make the dance
The heart can feel  emotion, we can both see love grow
Show me your love

Show me your love
Show me the love, the mystery
Take me back to honesty
I need to feel your light so we can love in harmony
Show me the light, your brightest star
Gimme your hand, let's make the dance
The heart can feel emotion, we can both see love grow
Show me your loveEmbed
