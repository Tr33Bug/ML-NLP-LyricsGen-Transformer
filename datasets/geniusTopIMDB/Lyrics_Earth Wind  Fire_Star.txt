Star Lyrics
In the sky shines a star
Spaces near and far
Calling out who you are
And smiling in the night

Star bright, star light (Alright), beaming 'cross the sky
Falling, calling, can you tell me why?
Star bright, star light, mighty light to see
Shining, smiling, down on you and me
Stars hide from the rain
It turns against the pain
Fooling many in the game
While smiling in the night

Star bright, star light (Hey), beaming 'cross the sky
Falling, calling, can you tell me why?
Star bright, star light (Alright), mighty light to see
Shining, smiling, down on you and me

I can feel the dark
Take the night apart
But then the stars come out
To lift my heart

Believing there's a star for everyone
Makes it easier to recall
That together, for the children of the world
There's a star smiling for us all

Star bright, star light (Hey), mighty light to see
Shining, smiling, down on you and me
Star bright, star light (Yeah), mighty light to see
Shining, smiling, down on you and me
You might also like
Star, shining high
Cultivating my desire
Graceful in the sky
While smiling in the night

Star bright, star light, beaming 'cross the sky
Falling, calling, can you tell me why?
Star bright, star light, mighty light to see
Shining, smiling, down on you and meEmbed
