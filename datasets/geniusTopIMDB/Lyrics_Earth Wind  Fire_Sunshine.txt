Sunshine Lyrics
Heavenly sunshine, only you can stop the rain
Pouring in my heart, and causing tears of pain
All of your feelin' seems to make me glow
Like heavenly sunshine makes the flowers grow, ooh, oh, Lord

You're my sunshine (You're my sunshine), loving you is my dream
When I'm with you (When I'm with you), I hear bluebells ring (Mm)
And the beauty only you can bring
Keep me smiling (Keep me smiling), my heart's filing
Away memories of a life with you (Away memories of a life with you, oh, baby)
Take me with you, I'm the one who's
Gonna lift you to your shining star (Gonna lift you to your shining star)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey, yeah

You are my light when dark days do appear, Lord
Bringing me sunshine, my heart has no fear, ooh
Birds in the air, they even sing your name
Spreading love's rainbows, an everlasting flame, ooh, oh, Lord

You're my sunshine (You're my sunshine), loving you is my dream
When I'm with you (When I'm with you), I hear bluebells ring (Mm)
And the beauty only you can bring
Keep me smiling (Keep me smiling), my heart's filing
Away memories of a life with you (Away memories of a life with you, oh, baby)
Take me with you, I'm the one who's
Gonna lift you to your shining star (Gonna lift you to your shining star)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

You're my sunshine (You're my sunshine), loving you is my dream
When I'm with you (When I'm with you), I hear bluebells ring (Mm)
And the beauty only you can bring
Keep me smiling (Keep me smiling), my heart's filing
Away memories of a life with you (Away memories of a life with you, oh, baby)
Take me with you, I'm the one who's
Gonna lift you to your shining star (Gonna lift you to your shining star)

Ooh, you make me happy, baby
You, hey, make me feel real good
Yeah, yeah, oh, baby, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And so it may seem that my life's a paradise
Ooh, but you, you are my sunshine
You make things alrightEmbed
