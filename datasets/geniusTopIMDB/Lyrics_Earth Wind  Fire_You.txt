You LyricsShe was naive and never knew
Back against the world, her dreams came true
There is a mirror in her eyes
All the world with cherry painted skies
I would be a fool not to notice who
Could make me want to give it all
Oh, and now, I'm a happy soul
And love has got a hold
I know that love won't let me fall
You light the way, you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that I'm in love with you
It's true, you changed my point of view
And now I look at life the way you do
When I am true with my dreams
Life is so sincere in what it means
I am truly hypnotized
With a love that took me by surprise
I would be a fool not to notice who
Could make me want to give it all
Oh, and now, love is so profound
I need your love around
To open up this lonely heart
You light the way, you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that I'm in love with you
It's true, you changed my point of view
And now I look at life the way you do
With a beauty shining through
You light the way, you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that I'm in love with you
It's true, you changed my point of view
You make it all seem right
I'd love to share my life with youYou might also likeEmbed
