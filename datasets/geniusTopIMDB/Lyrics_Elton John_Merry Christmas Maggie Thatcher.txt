Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher Lyrics
Can you hear it in the distance?
Can you... sense it far away?
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer?
Is it Santa on his sleigh?
It's heading up to Easington
It's coming down the Tyne
Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!

So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death
They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...

Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

And they've brought their fascist bootboys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...
You might also like
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death
Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling Heseltine
You're a tosser, you're a wanker
And you're just a Tory Swine1Embed
