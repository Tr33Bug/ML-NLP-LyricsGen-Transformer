Step Into Christmas Lyrics
Welcome to my Christmas song
I'd like to thank you for the year
So I'm sendin' you this Christmas card
To say, "It's nice to have you here"

I'd like to sing about all the things
Your eyes and mind can see
So hop aboard the turntable
Oh, step into Christmas with me, yeah
Step into Christmas, let's join together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission's free

Take care in all you do next year
And keep smilin' through the days
If we can help to entertain you
Oh, we will find the ways

So merry Christmas, one and all
There's no place I'd rather be
Than askin' you if you'd oblige
Steppin' into Christmas with me

Step into Christmas, let's join together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission's free, oh

Welcome to my Christmas song
I'd like to thank you for the year
So I'm sendin' you this Christmas card
To say, "It's nice to have you here"
You might also like
I'd like to sing about all the things
Your eyes and mind can see
So hop aboard the turntable
Oh, step into Christmas with me, yeah

Step into Christmas, let's join together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission's free

Step into Christmas, let's join together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission's free

Step into Christmas, let's join together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission's free, oh

(Step, step into Christmas)
(Ah, forever and ever)
(Yeah, come along with me)
(Ah) Oh
(Step, step into Christmas)
(Ah, forever and ever)
(Yeah, come along with me)
(Ah)Embed
