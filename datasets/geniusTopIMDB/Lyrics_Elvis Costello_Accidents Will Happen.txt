Accidents Will Happen Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I just don't know where to begin
Though he says he'll wait forever, it's now or never
But she keeps him hanging on, the silly champion
She says she can't go home without a chaperone

[Chorus]
Accidents will happen, we only hit and run
He used to be your victim, now you're not the only one
Accidents will happen, we only hit and run
I don't wanna hear it 'cause I know what I've done
[Verse 2]
There's so many fish in the sea
That only rise up in the sweat and smoke like mercury
But they keep you hanging on, they say you're so young
Your mind is made up, but your mouth is undone

[Chorus]
Accidents will happen, we only hit and run
He used to be your victim, now you're not the only one
Accidents will happen, we only hit and run
I don't wanna hear it 'cause I know what I've done

[Bridge]
And it's the damage that we do and never know
It's the words that we don't say that scare me so

[Verse 3]
There's so many people to see
So many people you can check up on and add to your collection
But they keep you hanging on until you're well hung
Your mouth is made up, but your mind is undone

[Chorus]
Accidents will happen, we only hit and run
He used to be your victim, now you're not the only one
Accidents will happen, we only hit and run
I don't wanna hear it 'cause I know what I've
I know what I've, I know what I've done

I know, I know...
