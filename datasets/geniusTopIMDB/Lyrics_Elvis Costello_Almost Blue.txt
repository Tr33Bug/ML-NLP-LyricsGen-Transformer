Almost Blue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Almost blue
Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Almost
All the things that your eyes once promised
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue

[Bridge]
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
[Verse 2]
Almost blue
It's almost touching it will almost do
There is part of me that's always true
Always
Not all good things come to an end
Now it is only a chosen few
I've seen such an unhappy couple

[Outro]
Almost me
Almost you
