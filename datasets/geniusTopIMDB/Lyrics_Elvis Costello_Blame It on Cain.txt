Blame It on Cain Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I had a little money
Government burglars took it
Long before I could mail it to you
Still, you are the only one
Now I can't let it slip away
So if the man with the ticker tape
He tries to take it
Well, this is what I'm going to say...

[Chorus]
Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn
[Verse 2]
Well, if I was a saint with a silver cup
And the money got low
We could always heat it up
Or trade it in
But then, the radio to heaven will be wired to your purse
And then, you can run down the wave band
Coast to coast, hand in hand
Bad to worse, curse for curse
Don't be dissatisfied
So you're not satisfied

[Chorus]
Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

[Verse 3]
I think I've lived a little too long
On the outskirts of town
I think I'm going insane
From talking to myself for so long
Oh, but I've never been accused
But when they step up on your face
You wear that good-luck grin
I got to break out one weekend
'Fore I do somebody in
But every single time
I feel a little stronger
They tell me it's a crime
Well, how much longer?
You might also like[Chorus]
Blame it on Cain
Don't blame it on me
Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault
But we need somebody to burn

[Outro]
Blame it on Cain
Oh, oh, oh, please, don't blame it on me
It's nobody's fault
But it just seems to be his turnEmbed
