Everyday I Write the Book Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah
Ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me you don't know what love is
When you're old enough to know better
When you find strange hands in your sweater
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote
I'm a man with a mission in two or three editions
[Chorus]
And I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
Everyday I write the book

[Verse 2]
Chapter one: we didn't really get along
Chapter two: I think I fell in love with you
You said you'd stand by me in the middle of chapter three
But you were up to your old tricks in chapters four, five and six

[Chorus]
And I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
Everyday I write the book

[Verse 3]
The way you walk, the way you talk and try to kiss me
And laugh in four or five paragraphs
All your compliments and your cutting remarks
Are captured here in my quotation marks (ooh-hoo)

[Chorus]
I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
Everyday I write the book
Everyday I write the book
You might also like[Verse 4]
Don't tell me you don't know the difference
Between a lover and a fighter
With my pen and my electric typewriter
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal
I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel

[Chorus]
And I'm giving you a longing look
Everyday (everyday), everyday (everyday), everyday
Everyday I write the book
Everyday (everyday), everyday
Everyday I write the book
Everyday (everyday), everyday
Everyday I write the book, ooh
Yeah

[Outro]
(Everyday, everyday, everyday)
(Everyday I write the book)
I'm giving you a longing look (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday, everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)
I'm giving you a longing look (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)
I'm giving you a longing look (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday, everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)
I'm giving you a longing look (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)
I'm giving you a longing look (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday, everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)
I'm giving you a longing look (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)
I'm giving you a longing look (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday, everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)
Everyday, everyday, everyday (Everyday, everyday)
Everyday, everyday (Everyday I write the book)
Everyday, everyday (I'm giving you a longing look)
(Everyday, everyday)
Everyday, everyday I write the book (Everyday I write the book)11Embed
