Goon Squad Lyrics
Mother, Father, I'm here in the zoo
I can't come home 'cause I've grown up too soon
I got my sentence, I got my command
They said they'd make me major if I met all their demands

I could be a corporal into corporal punishment
Or the general manager of a large establishment
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod
But I never thought they'd put me in the...
Goon squad
They've come to look you over and they're giving you the eye
Goon squad
They want you to come out to play, you'd better say goodbye

Some grow up just like their dads and some grow up too tall
Some go drinking with the lads, some don't grow up at all
You must find the proper place for everything you see
But you'll never get to make a lampshade out of me

I could join a chain of males or be the missing link
Looking for a lucky girl to put me in the pink
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod
But I never thought they'd put me in the...

Goon squad
They've come to look you over and they're giving you the eye
Goon squad
They want you to come out to play, you'd better say goodbye

I fit in a little dedication with one eye on the clock
They caught you under medication, you could be in for a shock
You might also like
Thinking up the alibis that everyone's forgotten
Just another Mummy's boy gone to rotten
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod
But I never thought they'd put me in the...

Goon squad
They've come to look you over and they're giving you the eye
Goon squad
They want you to come out to play, you'd better say goodbyeEmbed
