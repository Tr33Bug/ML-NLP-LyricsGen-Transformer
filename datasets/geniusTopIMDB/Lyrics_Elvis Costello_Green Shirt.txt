Green Shirt Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a smart young woman on a light blue screen
Who comes into my house every night
She takes all the red, yellow, orange and green
And she turns them into black and white

[Chorus]
But you tease, and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it
[Post-Chorus 1]
Better cut off all identifying labels
Before they put you on the torture table

[Verse 2]
'Cause somewhere in the "Quisling Clinic"
There's a shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes
She's listening in to the Venus line
She's picking out names
I hope none of them are mine

[Chorus]
But you tease, and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself but somebody's gonna get it

[Bridge]
Never said I was a stool pigeon
I never said I was a diplomat
Everybody is under suspicion
But you don't wanna hear about that

[Chorus]
'Cause you tease and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it
You might also like[Post-Chorus 2]
Better send a begging letter to the big investigation
Who put these fingerprints on my imagination?

[Chorus]
You tease, and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it

[Outro]
You can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get it
You can please yourself, but somebody's gonna get itEmbed
