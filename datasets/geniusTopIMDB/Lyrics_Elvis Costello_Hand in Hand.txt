Hand in Hand Lyrics
Hand in hand

No, don't ask me to apologize
I won't ask you to forgive me
If I'm going to go down
You're going to come with me

You say, "Why don't you be a man about it
Like they do in the grown-up movies?"
But when it comes to the other way around
You say you just want to use me, oh
You sit and you wonder whether
It's going to be syndicated
You sit with your knees together
All the time, your breath is bated
Hand in hand
No, don't ask me to apologize
I won't ask you to forgive me
If I'm going to go down
You're going to come with me

Don't you know I got the bully boys out
Changing someone's facial design?
Sitting with my toy room lout
Polishing my precious china
Don't you know I'm an animal?
But don't you know I can't stand up steady?
But you can't show me any kind of hell
That I don't know already

Hand in hand
No, don't ask me to apologize
I won't ask you to forgive me
If I'm going to go down
You're going to come with me
Hand in hand
Hand in hand
Hand in hand
You might also like
Hand in hand, hand in hand
Hand in hand, hand in hand
Hand in hand, hand in hand
Hand in hand, hand in hand
Hand in hand, hand in hand
Hand in hand, hand in hand...Embed
