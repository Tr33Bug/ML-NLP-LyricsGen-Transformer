High Fidelity Lyrics[Verse 1]
Some things you never get used to
Even though you're feeling like another man
There's nothing that he can do for you
To shut me away as you walk through
Lovers laughing in their amateur hour
Holding hands in the corridors of power
Even though I'm with somebody else right now

[Chorus]
High fidelity
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
High fidelity
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

[Bridge]
There's a new kind of dedication
Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel
Maybe I got above my station
Maybe you're only changing channel

[Verse 2]
Even though you're nowhere near me
And I know you kiss him so sincerely now
Even though the signal's indistinct
And you worry what silly people think
Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out
Bet he thinks that he was chosen out of the millions
I suppose you'll never know about

[Chorus]
High fidelity
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
You might also likeHigh fidelity
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

[Outro]
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?Embed
