I Canâ€™t Stand Up for Falling Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm the living result
I'm a man who's been hurt a little too much
Now I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel

[Chorus]
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down

[Verse 2]
Simple though love is
Still it confused me
Why I'm not loved the way I should be
Now I've lived with heartaches
And I've roomed with fear
I've dealt with despair
And I've wrestled with tears
[Chorus]
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling down

[Bridge]
The vow that we made
You broke it in two
But that don't stop me from loving you

[Chorus]
I can't stand up for falling down
I can't stand up for falling downYou might also likeEmbed
