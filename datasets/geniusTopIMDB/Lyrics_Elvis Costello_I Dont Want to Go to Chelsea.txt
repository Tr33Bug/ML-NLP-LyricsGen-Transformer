(I Don’t Want to Go to) Chelsea Lyrics[Verse 1]
Photographs of fancy tricks
To get your kicks at sixty-six
He thinks of all the lips that he licks
And all the girls that he's going to fix

[Pre-Chorus]
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
But there's no place here for the miniskirt waddle
Capital punishment, she's last year's model
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie
I don't want to go to Chelsea
[Chorus]
Oh no, it does not move me
Even though I've seen the movie
I don't want to check your pulse
I don't want nobody else
I don't want to go to Chelsea

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got new orders
Be a nice girl and kiss the warders
Now the teacher is away
All the kids begin to play

[Pre-Chorus]
Men come screaming, dressed in white coats
Shake you very gently by the throat
One's named Gus, one's named Alfie
I don't want to go to Chelsea

[Chorus]
Oh no, it does not move me
Even though I've seen the movie
I don't want to check your pulse
I don't want nobody else
I don't want to go to Chelsea

Photographs of fancy tricks
To get your kicks at sixty-six
He thinks of all the lips that he licks
And all the girls that he's a-going to fix

[Pre-Chorus]
She gave a little flirt, gave herself a little cuddle
But there's no place here for the miniskirt waddle
Capital punishment, she's last year's model
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie
I don't want to go to Chelsea

[Chorus]
Oh no, it does not move me
Even though I've seen the movie
I don't want to check your pulse
I don't want nobody else
I don't want to go to Chelsea2Embed
