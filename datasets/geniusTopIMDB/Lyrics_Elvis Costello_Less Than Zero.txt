Less Than Zero Lyrics[Verse 1]
Calling Mister Oswald with the swastika tattoo
There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo
Carving 'V' for vandal on the guilty boy's head
When he's had enough of that, maybe you'll take him to bed
To teach him he's alive 'fore he wishes he was dead

[Chorus]
Turn up the TV, no one listening will suspect
Even your mother won't detect it
So your father won't know
They think that I've got no respect
But everything means less than zero
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, red
Hey, red

[Verse 2]
Oswald and his sister are doing it again
They've got the finest home movies that you have ever seen
They've got a thousand variations: every service with a smile
They're going to take a little break, and they'll be back after a while
Well, I hear that South America is coming into style

[Chorus]
Turn up the TV, no one listening will suspect
Even your mother won't detect it
So your father won't know
They think that I've got no respect
But everything means less than zero

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, red
Hey, red

[Verse 3]
A pistol was still smoking; a man lay on the floor
Mister Oswald said he had an understanding with the law
He said he heard about a couple living in the USA
He said they traded in their baby for a Chevrolet
Let's talk about the future now, we've put the past away
You might also like[Chorus]
Turn up the TV, no one listening will suspect
Even your mother won't detect it
So your father won't know
They think that I've got no respect, but
Everything means less than zero

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, red
Hey, red

[Outro]
Hey, red
Hey, red
Hey, hey
Hey, red
Hey, red
Hey, red
