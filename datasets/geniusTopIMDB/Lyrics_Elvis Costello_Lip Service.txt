Lip Service Lyrics[Verse 1]
You left the motor running
But I know you're so attractive
Getting in some sharp practice
You better not do anything reckless

[Pre-Chorus]
But everybody is going through the motions
Everybody is going through the motions
Are you really only going through the motions?
[Chorus]
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me

[Verse 2]
Don't make any sudden movements
These are dangerous amusements
When did you become so choosy?
Don't act like you're above me, just look at your shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
If everybody is going through the motions
Everybody is going through the motions
Are you really only going through the motions?

[Chorus]
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
Lip service is all you'll ever get from me
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to me
But if you change your mind, you can send it in a letter to meYou might also likeEmbed
