Lipstick Vogue Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't say you love me when it's just a rumor
Don't say a word if there is any doubt
Sometimes, I think that love is just a tumor
You've got to cut it out
You say you're sorry for the things that you have done
You say you're sorry but you know you don't mean it
I wouldn't worry, I had so much fun
Sometimes, I almost feel just like a human being

[Chorus]
It's you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
It's you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
Oh yeah
[Verse 2]
Get to the slot machine almost dead on arrival
Just hit me one more time with that live wire
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million
You say I've got no feelings
This is a good way to kill them

[Bass Solo]

[Verse 3]
Select the control and then insert the token
You wanna throw me away but I'm not broken
You've got a lot to say, well, I'm not joking
There are some words they don't allow to be spoken
Sometimes, I almost feel just like a human being

[Chorus]
It's you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
It's you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue

[Outro]
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogue
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogue
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogue
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogueYou might also likeEmbed
