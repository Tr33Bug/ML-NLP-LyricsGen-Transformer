Living in Paradise Lyrics
I don't like those other guys looking at your curves
I don't like you walking 'round with physical jerks
Everything they say and do is getting on my nerves
Soon, they will be lucky to be picking up the perks

'Cause when they pull the shutters down
And throw up in the dark
They'll find that all the dogs outside
Bite much worse than they bark
Here we are living in paradise (Paradise!)
Living in luxury
Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long
You'd better have your fun before it moves along
And you're already looking for another fool like me

I call you Betty Felon 'cause you are a pretty villain
And I think that I should tell 'em
That you'd make a pretty killing
'Cause meanwhile, up in heaven they are waiting at the gate
Saying, "We'd always knew you'd make it
Didn't think you'd come this late"

And now, it's much too dangerous to stop what you've begun
When everyone in paradise carries a gun

Here we are living in paradise (Paradise!)
Living in luxury
Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long
You'd better have your fun before it moves along
And you're already looking for another fool like me
You might also like
Later in the evening, when arrangements are made
I'll be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door
'Cause I'm the first to know whenever the plans are laid
That never go further than floor to floor

You think that I don't know the boy that you're touching
But I'll be at the video and I will be watching

Here we are living in paradise (Paradise!)
Here we are living in paradise (Paradise!)
Here we are living in paradise (Paradise!)
Here we are living in paradise (Paradise!)
Living in luxury
Oh, the thrill is here but it won't last long
You'd better have your fun before it moves along
And you're already looking for another fool like me
And you're already looking for another fool like me
And you're already looking for another fool like me
And you're already looking for another fool like me
And you're already looking for another fool1Embed
