Man Out of Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
So this is where he came to hide
When he ran from you
In a private detective's overcoat
And dirty dead man's shoes
The pretty things of Knightsbridge
Lying for a minister of state
Is a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at traitor's gate

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Because the high heel he used to be has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around
[Chorus]
To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?

[Verse 2]
There's a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination
But for his private wife and kids somehow
Real life becomes a rumor
Days of Dutch courage
Just three French letters and a German sense of humor

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege

[Chorus]
To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?

[Verse 3]
The biggest wheels of industry
Retire sharp and short
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought
Somebody's creeping in the kitchen
There's a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knife's edge
Who's up late polishing the blade
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 3]
Love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning
You drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning

[Chorus]
To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time?

[Outro]
Will you still love a man out of time?
Will you still love a man out of time?3Embed
