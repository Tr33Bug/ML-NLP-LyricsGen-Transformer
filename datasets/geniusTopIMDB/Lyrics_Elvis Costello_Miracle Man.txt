Miracle Man Lyrics
You never asked me what I wanted
You only asked me why
I never thought that so much trouble
Was resting on my reply
I could say it was the nights when I was lonely
And you were the only one who'd come
I could tell you that I like your sensitivity
When you know it's the way that you walk

Why do you have to say that there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?
Baby's got to have the things she wants
You know, she's got to have the things she loves
She's got a ten-inch bamboo cigarette holder
And her black patent leather gloves
And I'm doing everything just trying to please her
Even crawling around on all fours
Oh, I thought by now that it was gonna be easy
But she still seems to want for more

Why do you have to say that there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?
Oh yeah!

Never given you a bad reputation
Just because you've never been denied
You try to say you've done it all before
Baby, you know that you just get tired
Yet everybody loves you so much, girl
I just don't know how you stand the strain
Oh, I, I'm the one who's here tonight
And I don't want to do it all in vain
You might also like
Why do you have to say that there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?
But don't you think that I know that walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?
Oh yeah!
