Mystery Dance Lyrics[Verse 1]
Romeo was restless, he was ready to kill
He jumped out the window 'cause he couldn't sit still
Juliet was waiting with a safety net
He said, "Don't bury me 'cause I'm not dead yet."

[Chorus]
Why don't you tell me 'bout the mystery dance?
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why don't you show me?
'Cause I've tried and I've tried
And I'm still mystified
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied
[Verse 2]
Well, I remember when the lights went out
And I was trying to make it look like it was never in doubt
She thought that I knew, and I thought that she knew
So both of us were willing, but we didn't know how to do it

[Chorus]
Why don't you tell me 'bout the mystery dance?
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why don't you show me?
'Cause I've tried and I've tried
And I'm still mystified
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I was down under the covers in the middle of the night
Trying to discover my left foot from my right
You can see those pictures in any magazine
But what's the use of looking when you don't know what they mean?

[Chorus]
Why don't you tell me 'bout the mystery dance?
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why don't you show me?
'Cause I've tried and I've tried
And I'm still mystified
I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied

I can't do it anymore and I'm not satisfied
