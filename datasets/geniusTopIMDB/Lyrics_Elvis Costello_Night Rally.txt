Night Rally Lyrics[Verse 1]
I would send out for assistance but there's someone on the signal wire
And the corporation logo is flashing on and off in the sky
They're putting all your names in the forbidden book
I know what they're doing but I don't want to look

[Chorus]
You think they're so dumb; you think they're so funny
Wait until they've got you running to the...
Night rally, night rally
Night rally
[Bridge]
Everybody's singing with their hand on their heart
About deeds done in the darkest hours
That's just the sort of catchy little melody
To get you singing in the showers

[Verse 2]
Oh, I know that I'm ungrateful
I've got it lying on a plate
And I'm not buying my share of souvenirs
You can stand to attention
You can pray to your uncle
Only get that chicken out of here
Everyone gets armbands and 3-D glasses
Some are in the back room
And they're taking those night classes

[Chorus]
You think they're so dumb, you think they're so funny
Wait until they've got you running to the...
Night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally
Night rally, night rally...You might also likeEmbed
