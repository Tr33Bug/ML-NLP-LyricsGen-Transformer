No Dancing Lyrics
I know that she has made a fool of him
Like girls have done so many nights before time and time again
Life is so strange, I don't know why
But somebody, somebody has to cry
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home

There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home
Now he's telling her every little thing he's done
Once he glanced at the jackets of some paperbacks, now he's read every one
He's such a drag, he's not insane
It's just that everybody has to feel his pain
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home

He's getting down on his knees
He finds that the girl is not so easy to please
Oh, oh, after all, his nights were just a paper striptease
She's caught it like some disease

If he says, "No dancing," there's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing on my own

She can't even speak to him, he can't face her now
He says, "Even though I want to shake your hand, all I ever do is bow
So now you see how it can be
Why can't you give me anything but sympathy?"

There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing on my ownYou might also likeEmbed
