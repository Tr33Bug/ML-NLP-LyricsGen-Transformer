No Dancing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know that she has made a fool of him
Like girls have done so many nights before time and time again
Life is so strange, I don't know why
But somebody, somebody has to cry
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home

[Chorus]
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home
[Verse 2]
Now he's telling her every little thing he's done
Once he glanced at the jackets of some paperbacks, now he's read every one
He's such a drag, he's not insane
It's just that everybody has to feel his pain
There's gonna be no dancing when they get home

[Bridge]
He's getting down on his knees
He finds that the girl is not so easy to please
Oh, oh, after all, his nights were just a paper striptease
She's caught it like some disease

[Chorus]
If he says, "No dancing," there's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing on my own

[Verse 3]
She can't even speak to him, he can't face her now
He says, "Even though I want to shake your hand, all I ever do is bow
So now you see how it can be
Why can't you give me anything but sympathy?"

[Outro]
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing
There's gonna be no dancing on my ownYou might also likeEmbed
