Senior Service Lyrics[Chorus]
Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
It's a breath you took too late
It's a death that's worse than fate
Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
Though it may be second-hand
It's by no means second-rate

[Verse 1]
I want your neck, I want the seat that you sit at
I want your check because they told me I would get on
I wanna chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket
If you should drop dead tonight, then they won't have to ask me twice
[Chorus]
Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
It's a breath you took too late
It's a death that's worse than fate
Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
Though it may be second-hand
It's by no means second-rate

[Bridge]
They took me in the office, and they told me very carefully
The way that I could benefit from death and disability

[Chorus]
Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
It's a breath you took too late
It's a death that's worse than fate
Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
Though it may be second-hand
It's by no means second-rate

[Verse 2]
I want your company car, I want your girlfriend and love
I want your place at the bar because there's always another man
To chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket
If you should drop dead tonight, then they won't have to ask me twice

Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
It's a breath you took too late
It's a death that's worse than fate
Senior service, junior dissatisfaction
Though it may be second-hand
It's by no means second-rate2Embed
