Shipbuilding Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it worth it?
A new winter coat and shoes for the wife
And a bicycle on the boy's birthday
It's just a rumor that was spread around town
By the women and children
Soon we'll be shipbuilding

[Verse 2]
Well I ask you
The boy said, "Dad they're going to take me to task
But I'll be back by Christmas"
It's just a rumor that was spread around town
Somebody said that someone got filled in
For saying that people get killed in
The result of this shipbuilding
[Bridge]
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls

[Trumpet Solo]

[Verse 3]
It's just a rumor that was spread around town
A telegram or a picture postcard
Within weeks they'll be re-opening the shipyard
And notifying the next of kin
Once again

[Bridge]
It's all we're skilled in
We will be shipbuilding
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls

[Trumpet Solo]

[Bridge / Outro]
It's all we're skilled in
We will be shipbuilding
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls
When we could be diving for pearls
When we could be diving for pearlsYou might also likeEmbed
