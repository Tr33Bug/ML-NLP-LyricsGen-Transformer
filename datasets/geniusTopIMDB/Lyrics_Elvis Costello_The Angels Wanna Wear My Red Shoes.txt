(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes Lyrics
Oh, I used to be disgusted
And now, I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know, the angels want to wear my red shoes
But when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older, now the angels want to wear my red shoes

Oh, oh, I was watching while you're dancing away
Our love got fractured in the echo and sway
How come everybody wants to be your friend?
You know that it still hurts me just to say it
Oh, I know that she's disgusted (Oh, why's that?)
Because she's feeling so abused (Oh, that's too bad)
She gets tired of the lust (Oh, I'm so sad)
But it's so hard to refuse
Can you say that I'm too old
When the angels have stolen my red shoes?

Oh, I said, "I'm so happy I could die."
She said, "Drop dead," then left with another guy
That's what you get if you go chasing after vengeance
Ever since you got me punctured, this has been my sentence

Oh, I used to be disgusted
Well now, I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know, the angels want to wear my red shoes
But when they told me 'bout their side of the bargain
That's when I knew that I could not refuse
And I won't get any older, now the angels want to wear my red shoes
Oh, I won't get any older, now the angels want to wear my red shoes

Red shoes, the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes, the angels want to wear my red shoes...You might also likeEmbed
