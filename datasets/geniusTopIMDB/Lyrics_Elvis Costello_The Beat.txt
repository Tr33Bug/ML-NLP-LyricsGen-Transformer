The Beat Lyrics[Verse 1]
We're all going on a summer holiday
Vigilantes coming out to follow me
Heard somebody say they're out to collar me
Anybody want to swallow me?

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes two to tumble, it takes two to tango
Speak up, don't mumble if you're in the combo

[Chorus]
On the beat (On the beat)
On the beat (On the beat)
'Til the man comes along and says
"Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ"
[Post-Chorus]
See your friends in the state they're in
See your friends getting under their skin
See your friends getting taken in

[Verse 2]
Well, if you only knew the things you do to me
I'd do anything to confuse the enemy
There's only one thing wrong with you befriendin' me
Take it easy, I think you're bendin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a bad boy with the standard leader
My neighbor's revving up his Vauxhall Viva

[Chorus]
On the beat (On the beat)
On the upbeat (On the beat)
'Til the man comes along and he says
"Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ"

[Post-Chorus]
See your friends walking down the street
See your friends never quite complete
See your friends getting under their feet
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh, I don't want to disease you
But I'm no good with machinery
Oh, I don't want to freeze you
Stop looking at the scenery
I keep thinking about your mother
Oh, I don't want to lick them
I don't want to be a lover
I just want to be your victim
I don't go out much at night
I don't go out much at all
Did you think you were the only one
Who was waiting for a call?

[Chorus]
On the beat (on the beat)
On the beat (on the beat)
On the upbeat (on the beat)
'Til the man comes along and he says
"Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ."

[Post-Chorus]
See your friends treat me like a stranger
See your friends despite all the arrangements
See your friends, nothing here has changed
[Outro]
Just the beat (just the beat)
Just the beat (just the beat)
Just the beat (just the beat)
Just the beatEmbed
