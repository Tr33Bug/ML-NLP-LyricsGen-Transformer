The Beat Lyrics
We're all going on a summer holiday
Vigilantes coming out to follow me
Heard somebody say they're out to collar me
Anybody want to swallow me?

It takes two to tumble, it takes two to tango
Speak up, don't mumble if you're in the combo

On the beat (On the beat)
On the beat (On the beat)
'Til the man comes along and says
"Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ"
See your friends in the state they're in
See your friends getting under their skin
See your friends getting taken in

Well, if you only knew the things you do to me
I'd do anything to confuse the enemy
There's only one thing wrong with you befriendin' me
Take it easy, I think you're bendin' me

I've been a bad boy with the standard leader
My neighbor's revving up his Vauxhall Viva

On the beat (On the beat)
On the upbeat (On the beat)
'Til the man comes along and he says
"Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ"

See your friends walking down the street
See your friends never quite complete
See your friends getting under their feet
You might also like
Oh, I don't want to disease you
But I'm no good with machinery
Oh, I don't want to freeze you
Stop looking at the scenery
I keep thinking about your mother
Oh, I don't want to lick them
I don't want to be a lover
I just want to be your victim
I don't go out much at night
I don't go out much at all
Did you think you were the only one
Who was waiting for a call?

On the beat (on the beat)
On the beat (on the beat)
On the upbeat (on the beat)
'Til the man comes along and he says
"Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy?
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ."

See your friends treat me like a stranger
See your friends despite all the arrangements
See your friends, nothing here has changed
Just the beat (just the beat)
Just the beat (just the beat)
Just the beat (just the beat)
Just the beatEmbed
