Welcome to the Working Week Lyrics
Now that your picture's in the paper being rhythmically admired
And you can have anyone that you have ever desired
All you got to tell me now is why, why, why, why?

Welcome to the working week
Oh, I know it don't thrill you; I hope it don't kill you
Welcome to the working week
You got to do it till you're through it and so you better get to it
All of your family had to kill to survive
And they're still waiting for their big day to arrive
But if they knew how I felt, they'd bury me alive

Welcome to the working week
Oh, I know it don't thrill you; I hope it don't kill you
Welcome to the working week
You got to do it till you're through it so you better get to it

I hear you saying, "Hey, the city's alright."
When you only read about it in books
Spend all your money getting so convinced
That you never even bother to look

Sometimes, I wonder if we're living in the same land
Why'd you want to be my friend
When I feel like a juggler running out of hands?

Welcome to the working week
Oh, ah, welcome to the working weekYou might also like2Embed
