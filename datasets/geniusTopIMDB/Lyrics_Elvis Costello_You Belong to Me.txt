You Belong to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
What are you girls going to tell your mother?
I don't want to hear another word about young lovers
Or hiding your boyfriend in the cupboard
She's been to see the doctor, so you hope that she recovers

[Pre-Chorus]
You act dumb
You say you're so numb
You say you don't come under his thumb
[Chorus]
Don't want to be a goody-goody
I don't want just anybody
No, I don't want anybody
Saying, "You belong to me, you belong to me."

[Verse 2]
Your eyes are absent, your mouth is silent
Pumping like a fire hydrant
Things you see are getting hard to swallow
You're easily led, but you're much too scared to follow

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been warned
You're going to get torn
No uniform is going to keep you warm

[Chorus]
Don't want to be a goody-goody
I don't want just anybody
No, I don't want anybody
Saying, "You belong to me, you belong to me."
You belong to me

[Outro]
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me

You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You, you belong to me
You, you belong to me
You belong to me2Embed
