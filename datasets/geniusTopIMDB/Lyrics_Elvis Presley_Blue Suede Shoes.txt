Blue Suede Shoes Lyrics
Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But uh-uh honey, lay off of them shoes
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes
Let's go, cat!

Ah, walk the dog

You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes

And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Rock it

Yeah!

Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
You might also like
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, baby
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes6Embed
