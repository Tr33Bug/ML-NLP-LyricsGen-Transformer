Crying In The Chapel Lyrics
You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I'm happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I've searched (I've searched) and I've searched (I've searched)
But I couldn't find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind
Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord (One accord)
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search (You'll search) and you'll search (You'll search)
But you'll never find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind

Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray (Knees and pray)
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way (And you'll surely find the way)You might also like3Embed
