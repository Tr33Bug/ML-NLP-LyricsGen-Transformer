Heartbreak Hotel Lyrics
Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely, baby
Well, I'm so lonely
I'll be so lonely, I could die
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

They'll be, they'll be so lonely, baby
They'll be so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

Now, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street
They'll never, never look back

And they get so, they get so lonely, baby
Well, they are so lonely
They're so lonely, they could die

Well, now, if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Well, just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel
You might also like
Where you will be, you will be, you'll be so lonely, baby
Well, you will be lonely
You'll be so lonely, you could die


Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom

Where they get so, they get so lonely, baby
Well, they're so lonely
They'll be so lonely, they could die13Embed
