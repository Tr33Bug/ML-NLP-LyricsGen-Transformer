I Canâ€™t Stop Loving You Lyrics
I can't stop loving you
I said  I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time

And I can't stop wanting you
I said It's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time

And I can't stop wanting you
I said it's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterdayYou might also like1Embed
