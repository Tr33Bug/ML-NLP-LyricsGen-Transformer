Stuck on You Lyrics
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake-a sugar, but you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

I'm going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Oh yeah, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah
Because I'm stuck on you
You might also likeI'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah
Because I'm stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah
Because I'm stuck on you4Embed
