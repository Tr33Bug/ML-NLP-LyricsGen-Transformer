Viva Las Vegas Lyrics
Bright light city going to set my soul
Going to set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas

How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
Even if there were forty more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again

I'm going to keep on the run
I'm going to have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke oh well
I'll always remember that I had a swinging time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
