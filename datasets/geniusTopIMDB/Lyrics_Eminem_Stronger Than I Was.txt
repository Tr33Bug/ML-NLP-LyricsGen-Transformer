TranslationsTürkçeStronger Than I Was Lyrics
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave!"
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was
You might also like
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you (Uh), ‘cause you made me (Uh)
A better person than I was
But I hate you (Uh), ‘cause you drained me (Uh)
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me (Uh), you're crazy (Uh)
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you!"
