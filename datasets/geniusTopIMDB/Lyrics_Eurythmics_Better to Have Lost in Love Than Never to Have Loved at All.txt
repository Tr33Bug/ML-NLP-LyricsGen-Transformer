Better to Have Lost in Love (Than Never to Have Loved at All) LyricsCool tears flow upon my pillow
And I'm freezing blue with misery
You know that I never meant to hurt you
But something always gets right in the way
So I'll fill this bedrom full of mystery
Hang our last conclusions on the wall
And if this empty building starts to get to me
Please remember that it just might be your fault
Better to have lost in love
Than never to have loved at all...
So the fated lovers turn to enemies -
And all their hidden feelings start to show
And I never though that boy
Could mean so much to me
And now it seems I'll have to let you go...You might also likeEmbed
