Here Comes the Rain Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

[Chorus]
So, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do
[Verse 2]
Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion (Ooh)
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

[Chorus]
So, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me (Ooh)
Like lovers do

[Synth Solo]

[Refrain]
So, baby, talk to me
Like lovers do

[Verse 4]
Here comes the rain again (I said)
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
I want to walk in the open wind (Mhm)
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?
