Home Is Where the Heart Is Lyrics[Chorus]
Home is where the heart is
At least that’s what they say
Gave me indications
Can’t be far away

[Verse 1]
Home is where the heart is (Heart is)
Now I’ve understood
Home is still a stranger
It’s never any good
[Verse 2]
Home is just a story (Story)
A room without a view
A room without a view
Pretty picture on the wall
Memories of you

[Bridge]
Memories
Memories
Memories

[Chorus]
Home is where the heart is (Heart is)
At least that’s what they say
Gave me indications
Can’t be far away

[Outro]
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far awayYou might also likeEmbed
