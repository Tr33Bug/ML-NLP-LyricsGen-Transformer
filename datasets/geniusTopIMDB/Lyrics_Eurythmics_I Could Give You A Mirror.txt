I Could Give You (A Mirror) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, how can you be so cold
With my arms to hold you?
How can you be so cold
With my arms to enfold you?

[Chorus]
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me?
[Verse 2]
Oh, how can you be so cold
When there's a fire burning?
How can you be so cold
When all the ice is melting?

[Chorus]
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me?
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, how can you be so cold
With my arms to hold you?
How can you be so cold
With my arms to enfold you?

[Chorus]
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me?
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me?
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me?
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me?You might also likeEmbed
