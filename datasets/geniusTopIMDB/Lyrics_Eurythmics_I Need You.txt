I Need You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I need you to pin me down
Just for one frozen moment
I need someone to pin me down
So I can live in torment
I need you to really feel
The twist of my back breaking
I need someone to listen
To the ecstasy I'm faking

[Chorus]
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
[Verse 2]
I need you to catch each breath
That issues from my lips
I need someone to crack my skull
I need someone to kiss
So hold me now
And make pretend
That I won't ever fall
Oh, hold me down
I'm gonna be your, baby, doll
Yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you
You, you
I need you, you, you

[Verse 3]
I need you to pin me down
Just for one frozen moment
I need someone to pin me down
So I can live in torment
I need you to really feel
The twist of my back breaking
I need someone to listen
To the ecstasy I'm faking, faking
I'm faking, I'm faking
You might also like[Chorus]
You, you, you
I need you

[Outro]
I need you, you, you
Is it you I really need?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I really do
I need youEmbed
