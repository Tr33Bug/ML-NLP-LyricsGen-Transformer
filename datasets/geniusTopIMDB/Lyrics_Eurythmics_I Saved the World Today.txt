I Saved the World Today Lyrics[Verse 1]
Monday finds you like a bomb
It's been left ticking there too long
You're bleeding
Some days there's nothing left to learn
From the point of no return
You're leaving

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, I saved the world today
Everybody's happy now
The bad thing's gone away
And everybody's happy now
The good thing's here to stay
Please let it stay
[Verse 2]
There's a million mouths to feed
But I've got everything I need
I'm breathing
And there's a hurting thing inside
But I've got everything to hide
I'm grieving

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, I saved the world today
And everybody's happy now
The bad thing's gone away
And everybody's happy now
The good thing's here to stay
Please let it stay
Let it stay, let it stay

[Interlude]
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, the good thing

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, I saved the world today
And everybody's happy now
The bad thing's gone away
And everybody's happy now
The good thing's here to stay
Please let it stay

Hey, hey, I saved the world today
And everybody's happy now
And everybody's happy now
The bad thing's gone away
Everybody's happy now (So happy now)
And everybody's happy now
The good thing's here to stay
Please let it, ooh, let it1Embed
