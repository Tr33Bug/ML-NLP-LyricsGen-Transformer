Iâ€™ve Got a Life LyricsTurn it down, so I can't hear it
Turn it out so I can't see it
It's just useless to ignore
We're going down, but you don't feel it
Turn it round, you don't mean it
And I can't stand it anymore
When the whole world sighs
And it's making you, so deflated
I've got a light
Though it refuses to shine
I've got a life
It ain't over, it ain't over (got a life)
I've got a way
It's the only thing that's mine (got a way)
All I'm asking for is tenderness
A little tenderness...
Tenderness
Oh it's a cruel place
And you never asked to be here
And nobody cares and no one's gonna help you now (ho no)
It's dog-eat-dog (dog-eat-dog), the human race
The only thing they'll do is hate you
Hate you
It's such a crime
To be unkind
You turn your cheek
Pretend you're blind
I've got a light
Though it refuses to shine (got a light)
I've got a life
It ain't over, it ain't over (got a life)
I've got a way
It's the only thing that's mine (got a way)
All I'm asking for is tenderness
Tenderness

Though it refuses to shine (got a light)
I've got a life
It ain't over, it ain't over (got a life)
I've got a way
It's the only thing that's mine (got a way)
All I'm asking for is tenderness
Tenderness
Strong now baby (I've got a light)
Gotta be strong now baby (though it refuses to shine)
(Got a light)
Gotta be strong (I've got a life)
Gotta be strong (It ain't over, it ain't over) (Got a life)
Strong now baby (I've got a way)
Gotta be strong now baby (got a way)
Gotta be strongEmbed
