Iâ€™ve Got an Angel Lyrics
Oh, I've got an angel
Oh, I've got an angel
Oh, I've got an angel
Oh, I've got an angel

The power of imagination
Goes right to my head
The power of imagination
Goes right to my head
(And I said)
Oh, I've got an angel
Oh, I've got an angel

The power of imagination
Goes right to my head
The power of imagination
Goes right to my head
The power of imagination
Goes right to my head
The power of imagination
Goes right to my head
(And I said)

Time is time is time to kill
Time is time is time to kill
Time is time is time to kill
Time is time is time to kill
Time is time is time to kill
Time is time is time to kill
Time is time is time to kill
Time is time is time to killYou might also likeEmbed
