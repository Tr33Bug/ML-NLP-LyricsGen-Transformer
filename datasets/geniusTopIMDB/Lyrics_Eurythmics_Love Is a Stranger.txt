Love Is a Stranger Lyrics[Verse 1]
Love is a stranger in an open car
To tempt you in and drive you far away
Ooh, love is a stranger in an open car
To tempt you in and drive you far away

[Chorus]
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
[Verse 2]
Love is a danger of a different kind
To take you away and leave you far behind
And love, love, love is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it and you still can't get enough of the stuff

[Verse 3]
It's savage and it's cruel and it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood and it seems like religion
It's noble and it's brutal, it distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up and you're left like a zombie

[Chorus]
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession

[Verse 4]
It's guilt edged, glamorous and sleek by design
You know it's jealous by nature, false and unkind
It's hard and restrained and it's totally cool
It touches and it teases as you stumble in the debris

[Chorus]
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
It's an obsessionYou might also like1Embed
