No Fear, No Hate, No Pain (No Broken Hearts) Lyrics[Non-Lyrical Vocal]

[Verse 1]
Well in the morning
When our day begins
And it feels like cold, cold, cold, cold steel
Ha!
And when the sun comes up
It's like a new commotion
You say, nobody told you
It would feel like this
Ha!
[Chorus]
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts

[Verse 2]
You've got the killing gun
Held in your hand
It feels like cold, cold, cold, cold steel
And when the sun comes up
It's makes a new commotion
You say shoot, shoot, shoot it up!
Shoot it up!

[Chorus]
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts

[Verse 3]
And when the sun comes up
It's like a new commotion
You say nobody told you
It would feel like this
Ha!

No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts

No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
No fear, no hate, no pain, no broken hearts
