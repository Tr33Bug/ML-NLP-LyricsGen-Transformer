Regrets Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've got a delicate mind
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture
I've got a delicate mind
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an electric wire
And I'm stuck inside your head
[Verse 2]
I'm a hungry Mohican
I've got a razor-blade smile
So don't come near me
I've got a singular style
Fifteen senses
Are on my plate
All the things
That you love to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an electric wire
And I'm stuck inside your head

[Chorus 1]
Where I go to no one knows
Find me where the cold wind blows
Where I go to no one knows
Find me where the cold wind blows
Regrets! (Yeah!)

[Verse 3]
I've got a delicate mind (Regrets!)
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides (Regrets!)
With your furniture
I've got a delicate mind (Regrets!)
I've got a dangerous...
And my fist collides
With your furniture

Regrets!
I'm an electric wire
I'm an electric wire
I'm an electric wire
Regrets!
Regrets!

[Chorus 2]
Regrets!
Black is red and red is white
In this country I do what I like
Regrets!
I say, black is red (Regrets!)
Regrets!
And red is white
Do what I like (Regrets!)
Yeah!

[Bridge 2]
Regrets!
That's right, that's right
That's right, that's right
That's right, that's right
That's right, that's right
Yeah!
Regrets!
[Outro]
Red is white (Regrets!)
Black is red and red is white
In this country I do what I like
Black is red and red is white
Regrets!
In this country I do what I like
Do what I like
Do what I like
Regrets!
Regrets!
