Right by Your Side Lyrics
Give me two strong arms
To protect myself
Give me so much love
That I forget myself
I need to swing from limb to limb
To relieve this mess I'm in
'Cause when depression starts to win
I need to be right by your side
Yes, I do
No one seems to touch me
In the way you do
Nothing seems to hurt me
When I'm close to you

I'm so full of desire
When you set my head on fire
I need to be right by your side
Yes, I do

Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah!

Every single one of us needs
Love, love, love
Everybody needs to give and receive love
Every single day can drag us
Down, down, down
But there's nothing left to fear
When love gets into town
You might also like
I'm so full of desire
When you set my head on fire
I need to be right by your side
Yeah!
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, yeah!

Give me two strong arms
To protect myself
Give me so much love
That I forget myself
I need to swing from limb to limb
To relieve this mess I'm in
'Cause when depression starts to win
I need to be right by your side
I need to be right by your side
