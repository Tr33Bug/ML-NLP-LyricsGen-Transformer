Savage Lyrics[Verse 1]
Words of power are killing me
While the sun displays its teeth
All mockery is laughing
All violence is cheap
She said
"These are my guns
These are my furs
This is my living room"
"You can play with me there sometimes
If you catch me in the mood"
[Chorus]
Savage
Savage
Savage
You savage...

[Verse 2]
She said
"I have this unhappiness
To wear around my neck"
"It's a pretty piece of jewellery
To show what I protect"
She said
"Everything is fiction
All cynic to the bone"
"So don't ask me to stay with you
Don't ask to see me home"

[Chorus]
Savage
Savage
Savage
You savage...

[Bridge]
Savage
Savage
You...
(You...)
