[Verse 1]
Can I take this for granted
With your eyes over me?
In this place this wintry home
I know there's always someone in

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And so I face the wall
Turn my back against it all
How I wish I'd been unborn
Wish I wasn't living here

[Verse 3]
Leave a big hole in the wall
Just where you are looking in
