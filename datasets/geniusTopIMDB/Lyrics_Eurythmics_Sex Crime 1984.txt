Hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Can I take this for granted
With your eyes over me?
In this place this wintry home
I know there's always someone in

Sexcrime
Sexcrime
Whoa
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four

And so I face the wall
Turn my back against it all
How I wish I'd been unborn
Wish I wasn't living here

Sexcrime
Sexcrime
Sexcrime
Sexcrime
Whoa
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
You might also like
I'll pull the bricks down
One by one
Hey hey hey

Leave a big hole in the wall
Just where you are looking in

Sexcrime
Sexcrime
Whoa
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty four
Nineteen eighty fourEmbed
