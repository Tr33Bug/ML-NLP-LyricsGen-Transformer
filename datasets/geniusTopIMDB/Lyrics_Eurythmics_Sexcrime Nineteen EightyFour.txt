Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four) Lyrics[Intro]
Sexcrime, crime

[Verse 1]
Can I take this for granted
With your eyes over me?
In this place this wintery home
I know there's always someone in

[Pre-Chorus]
Sexcrime, sexcrime
[Chorus]
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four

[Verse 2]
And so I face the wall
Turn my back against it all
How I wish I'd been unborn
Wish I was unliving here

[Pre-Chorus]
Sexcrime, sexcrime
Sexcrime, sexcrime

[Chorus]
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four

[Verse 3]
I'll pull the bricks down
One by one
(Yeah!)
Leave a big hole in the wall
Just where you are looking in

[Pre-Chorus]
Sex crime, sex crime

Nineteen eighty-four
(Hey! Hey!)
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four
(Hey! Hey!)

Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-fourEmbed
