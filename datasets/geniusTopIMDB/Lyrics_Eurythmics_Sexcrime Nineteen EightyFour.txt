Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four) Lyrics
Sexcrime, crime

Can I take this for granted
With your eyes over me?
In this place this wintery home
I know there's always someone in

Sexcrime, sexcrime
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four

And so I face the wall
Turn my back against it all
How I wish I'd been unborn
Wish I was unliving here

Sexcrime, sexcrime
Sexcrime, sexcrime

Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four

I'll pull the bricks down
One by one
(Yeah!)
Leave a big hole in the wall
Just where you are looking in

Sex crime, sex crime
You might also like
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four
(Hey! Hey!)
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four
(Hey! Hey!)
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four
(Hey! Hey!)
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-four
Nineteen eighty-fourEmbed
