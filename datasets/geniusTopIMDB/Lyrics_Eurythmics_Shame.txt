Shame Lyrics[Intro]
Shame!

[Verse 1]
Now there's a lifestyle
With painted lips
Now there's a lifestyle
Everybody wants it
But it don't exist
And I said shame...
[Chorus 1]
In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame!
On the TV and the media
Shame!
We loved you
Shame!
In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame!
On the TV and the media
Shame!
We loved you

[Verse 2]
Now there's a lifestyle
With fashion chic
Now there's a lifestyle
Everybody in it wants
To be elite
And I said
"You with yer brand new shoes and
You with yer greasy hair and
You with yer mother's pride and poetry"
"Don't you want to feel the shame?"

[Chorus 1]
In the dancehalls
Can't you feel the shame?
And the TV
Can't you feel no shame?
We loved you
Shame!
In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame!
On the TV and the media
Shame!
We loved you

Shame!
At the Lido and the opera
Shame!
At the races and the theatre
Shame!
We loved you
And they said all we need is love
Shame!
In the dancehalls
All we need is love
And the TV
All we need is love
We loved you
With the Beatles and the Rolling Stones
Shame!
At the Lido and the opera
Shame!
At the races
And the theatre
Shame!
We loved you

[Outro]
Day after day (In the dancehalls)
Day after day(In the dancehalls)
Day after day(In the dancehalls)Embed
