Sisters Are Doinâ€™ It for Themselves Lyrics[Verse 1: Annie Lennox & Aretha Franklin, Both]
Now there was a time
When they used to say
That behind every "great man"
There had to be a "great woman"
But in these times of change
You know that it's no longer true
So we're coming out of the kitchen
'Cause there's something we forgot to say to you (we say)

[Chorus: Annie Lennox & Aretha Franklin]
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
[Verse 2: Annie Lennox & Aretha Franklin, Both]
Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too, yeah
Woman to woman
We're singing with you
The "inferior sex" got a new exterior (yeah)
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too - oo
Everybody, take a look around
Can you see? Can you see? Can you see?
There's a woman right next to you

[Chorus: Annie Lennox & Aretha Franklin]
Sisters are doing it for themselves (oh yes we are)
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

[Bridge: Annie Lennox & Aretha Franklin, Both]
Now we ain't making stories
And we ain't laying plans
'Cause a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man
(Just the same though)

There was a time
When they used to say
That behind every great man
There had to be a great woman
But in these times of change
You know that it's no longer true
So we're coming out of the kitchen
'Cause there's something we forgot to say to you (we say)

[Chorus: Annie Lennox & Aretha Franklin]
Sister are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Sisters are doing it for themselves (yeah, yeah)
Sisters are doing it, doing it for themselves (doing it, doing it)
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Sister are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Sister are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Thank you, I'll get it myself3Embed
