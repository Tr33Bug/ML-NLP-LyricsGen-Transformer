Somebody Told Me Lyrics
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Something about you

I didn't believe it
I couldn't believe it
I'm still reeling
'Cause I just can't take the blow
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again

Full of forgiveness
You're just twisted
I'm a silly little saint
With a halo of smiles
But it makes no difference

Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well (Well!), well (Well!), well (Well!), well

Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Something about you

I didn't believe it
I didn't believe it
I couldn't believe it
I didn't believe it
I'm still reeling
'Cause I just can't take the blow

Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well (Well! Yeah, yeah, yeah!)Embed
