Somebody Told Me Lyrics[Intro]
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Something about you

[Verse 1]
I didn't believe it
I couldn't believe it
I'm still reeling
'Cause I just can't take the blow
[Chorus]
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again

[Verse 2]
Full of forgiveness
You're just twisted
I'm a silly little saint
With a halo of smiles
But it makes no difference

[Chorus]
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well (Well!), well (Well!), well (Well!), well

[Bridge: Annie Lennox & David A. Stewart]
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Something about you

[Verse 3: Annie Lennox & David A. Stewart]
I didn't believe it
I didn't believe it
I couldn't believe it
I didn't believe it
I'm still reeling
'Cause I just can't take the blow

[Chorus]
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well there's laughter and love
And there's a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
[Outro]
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well (Well! Yeah, yeah, yeah!)Embed
