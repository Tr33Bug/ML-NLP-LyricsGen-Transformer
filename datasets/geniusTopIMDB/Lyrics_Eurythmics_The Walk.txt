The Walk Lyrics
I could be contended
I don't need to suffer
You're beautiful
Good to talk to
You make an impression
To take my attention
And when you touch my skin
I smell disaster

Step away – walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away – walk away
(Nothing but the real thing)
Step away – walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away – walk away
(It should be me and you)
Let's just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Let's just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Let's just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Let's just close our eyes

Walking on pavements
We collect in bars
Asleep in the houses
So alone...
Looking inside herself
She breaks the glass
Turns her head backwards
She's fallen down again

Step away – walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away – walk away
(Nothing but the real thing, it should be me and you)
Step away – walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away – walk away
(Nothing but the real thing, it should be me and you)
