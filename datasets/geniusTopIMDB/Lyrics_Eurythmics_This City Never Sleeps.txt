This City Never Sleeps Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder
You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder

[Verse 2]
You know there's so many people
Living in this house
And don't even know their names
You know there's so many people
Living in this house
And don't even know their names
[Chorus]
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)

[Verse 3]
You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder
You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder

[Verse 4]
Walls so thin I can almost
Hear them breathing
And if I listen in
I feel my own heart beating
Walls so thin I can almost
Hear them breathing
And if I listen in
I feel my own heart beating

[Chorus]
In the city!
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)

I guess it's just a feeling
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
I guess it's just a feeling (It's just a feeling, it's just a feeling, yeah, it's just a feeling)
I guess it's just a feeling (In the city!)
(It's just a feeling, it's just a feeling, yeah, it's just a feeling)Embed
