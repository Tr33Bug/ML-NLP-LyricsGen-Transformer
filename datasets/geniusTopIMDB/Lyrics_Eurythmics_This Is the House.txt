This Is the House Lyrics[Chorus]
Esta es la casa
Este es el cerro
Esta la historia
Es algo chiquitito

[Verse 1]
This is the house
This is the hill
This is the story
It's a little thing
A lock of hair
An invisible smoke trail
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh, oh, oh, everything changes
[Verse 2]
This is your picture
It's in black and white
This is the family
Having a party
There's a crack in the ceiling
And there's an open door
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh, oh, oh, everything changes

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Esta es la casa
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Esta la historia
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Es algo chiquitito
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
This is the house
This is the hill
This is the story
It's a little thing
A lock of hair
An invisible smoke trail
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh, oh, oh, everything changes
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
This is the houseEmbed
