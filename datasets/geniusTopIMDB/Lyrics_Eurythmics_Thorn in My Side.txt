Thorn in My Side Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah!
You gave me such a bad time
Tried to hurt me, but now I know

[Verse 1]
Thorn in my side
You know that's all you ever were
A bundle of lies
You know that's all that it was worth
I should have known better
But I trusted you at first
I should have known better
But I got what I deserved
Oo-woah-uwoah-woah-woah
(Oo-woah-uwoah-woah-woah)
Oo-woah-uwoah-woah-woah
[Chorus]
To run away from you
(So run-run, run, run)
Was all that I could do
(Run-run, run, run)
To run away from you
(So run-run, run, run)
Was all that I could do
(Run-run, run, run)
To run away from you
(So run-run, run, run)
Was all that I could do

[Verse 2]
Thorn in my side
You know that's all you'll ever be
So don't think you know better
'Cause that's what you mean to me
I was feeling complicated
I was feeling low
Now every time I think of you
I shiver to the bone
Oo-woah-uwoah-woah-woah
(Oo-woah-uwoah-woah-woah)
Oo-woah-uwoah-woah-woah

To run away from you
(So run-run, run, run)
Was all that I could do
(Run-run, run, run)
To run away from you
(So run-run, run, run)

[Bridge]
(Run-run, run, run)
(Run-run, run, run)
(Run-run, run, run)
(Run-run, run, run)
(So run-run, run, run)
(Run-run, run, run)
(So un-run, run, run)
(Run-run, run, run)
(So un-run, run, run)

[Outro]
To run away from you
(Run-run, run, run)
Was all that I could do
(So un-run, run, run)
To run away from you
(Run-run, run, run)
Was all that I could do
(So un-run, run, run)
(Run-run, run, run)
(So un-run, run, run)Embed
