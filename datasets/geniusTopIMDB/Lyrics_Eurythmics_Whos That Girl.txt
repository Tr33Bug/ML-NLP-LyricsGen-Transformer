Whoâ€™s That Girl? Lyrics[Intro]
Who's that girl?

[Verse 1]
The language of love slips from my lover's tongue
Cooler than ice cream and warmer than the sun
Dumb hearts get broken just like china cups
The language of love has left me broken on the rocks

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's just one thing (Ah)
Just one thing (Hey)
But there's just one thing (Oh, yeah)
And I really wanna know
[Chorus]
Who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl?

[Verse 2]
The language of love has left me stony grey
Tongue tied and twisted at the price I've had to pay
Your careless notions have silenced these emotions
Look at all the foolishness your lover's talk has done

[Chorus]
Who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl?

[Post-Chorus]
But there's just one thing (Ah)
Just one thing (Hey)
But there's just one thing
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Tell me
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
