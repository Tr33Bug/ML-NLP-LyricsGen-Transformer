I've been watching you for days now, baby
I just love your sexy ways now, baby
You now my love will never stop now, baby
Just put your loving in my box, baby

[Verse 2]
No more will I shop around, baby
You know I've got the best thing in town now, baby
I've seen all I wanna see, baby
What your loving means to me now, baby

Give you sweet things from my candy jar
You've got treats you ain't ever used
Give it give it to me
It won't get abused
