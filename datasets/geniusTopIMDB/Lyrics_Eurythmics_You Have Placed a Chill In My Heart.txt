You Have Placed a Chill In My Heart Lyrics
You have placed a chill in my heart
You have placed a chill in my heart

Take me to the desert where there's got to be
A whole heap of nothing for you and me
Take me to the desert, take me to the sand
Show me the color of your right hand

You have placed a chill in my heart
You have placed a chill in my heart
Love is a temple, love is a shrine
Buy some love at the five and dime
A little bit of love from the counter store
Get it on credit if you need some more
I'll be the figure of your disgrace
A criss-cross pattern upon your face
A woman's just too tired to think
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink

I wish I was invisible, so I could climb through the telephone
When it hurts my ear, and it hurts my brain
And it makes me feel too much
Too much, too much, too much
Don't cut me down when I'm talking to you
'Cause I'm much too tall to feel that small

Love is a temple, love is a shrine
Love is pure, and love is blind
Love is a religious sign
I'm gonna leave this love behind
Love is hot, and love is cold
I've been bought, and I've been sold
Love is rock, and love is roll
I just want someone to hold
You might also like
Hold me now!
Hold me now, baby!
Come on!
Yeah!

You have placed a chill in my heart
(Make me feel, come on, now!)
You have placed a chill in my heart
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
You have placed a chill in my heart
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Whoo!)
You have placed a chill in my heart
(Gimme two times, gimme two times)
(Gimme two times, gimme two times)
(Gimme two times, yeah!)Embed
