Hold Me Lyrics
Can you understand me
Baby, don't you hand me a line
Although it doesn't matter
You and me got plenty of time
There's nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
Oh, there's no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
I don't want no damage
But how'm I going to manage you?
Oh, you want a percentage
But I'm the fool payin' the dues
Oh, I'm-a just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
I'll be waitin' for you
If you ever wanna be there

Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Why won't you) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me


(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me
(Come on and) Hold me, hold me, hold me

Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold meYou might also like2Embed
