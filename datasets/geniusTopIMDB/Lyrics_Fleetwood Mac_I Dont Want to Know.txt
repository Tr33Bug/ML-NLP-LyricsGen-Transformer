I Donâ€™t Want to Know Lyrics
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

Finally, baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
It's crying out loud
Trying to believe
Oh, you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Oh, oh, yeah, uh huh
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine
I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love
Honey, I just want you to feel fine

Finally, baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that I'm crazy
It's nothing that I didn't know
Trying to survive
Oh, you say you love me, but you don't know
You got me rocking and a-reeling
Hanging on to you
Oh, oh, yeah, uh huh

I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I don't want to stand between you and love, honey
Take a little time
