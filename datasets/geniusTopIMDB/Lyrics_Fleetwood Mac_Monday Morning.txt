Monday Morning Lyrics
Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you fade away
I can't go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
Tell me what you really want to do
First you love me, then you get on down the line

But I don't mind
I don't mind, yeah
I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind

Monday morning, you sure look fine
Friday, I got travelin' on my mind
First you love me, and then you say it's wrong
You know I can't go on believing for long
But you know it's true (Yes)
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me, then you get on down the line

But I don't mind
No, I don't mind, yeah

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind


But you know it's true
You know you only want me when I get over you
Oh, first you love me, then you get on down the line
You might also like
But I don't mind
No, I don't mind, yeah

I'll be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind4Embed
