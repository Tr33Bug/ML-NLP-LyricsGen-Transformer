Over My Head Lyrics{Intro}

You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice

You can take me anytime you like
I'll be around if you think you might
Love me, baby (Over my head)
And hold me tight
Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time
{Instrumental}

Your mood is like a circus wheel
You're changing all the time
Sometimes I can't help but feel
That I'm wasting all of my time

I think I'm looking on the dark side
But every day you hurt my pride
I'm over my head (Over my head)
Oh, but it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
But it sure feels nice
I'm over my head (Over my head)
But it sure feels nice
