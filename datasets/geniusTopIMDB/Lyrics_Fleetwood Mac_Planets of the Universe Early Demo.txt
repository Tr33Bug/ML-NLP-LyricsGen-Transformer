Planets of the Universe (Early Demo) LyricsAnd the planets of the universe go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon, or by the day
You and I will simply disappear out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be no light
I will never love again the way I loved you
You will never rule again the way you've ruled
We will never change again the way we are changing
Oh, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
Oh, you'll forget the chill of love but not the strain
You will remember but I will die slowly
It's only an overture to something that was best
And don't, don't condescend me
Take your leave
Take your leave
Take your leave of me now
Disappear through the year
I wish you gone and I don't care
Now I know
Well, I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream
Oh, I would never dreamYou might also like1Embed
