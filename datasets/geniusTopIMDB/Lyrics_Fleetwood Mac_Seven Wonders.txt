Seven Wonders Lyrics
So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

The rainbow's edge
(Aaron)
(Aaron)

So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

The rainbow's edge

So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand

If I hope and if I pray
Ooh, it might work out someday

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty, that same same beauty again)
If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(Well if I hope and I pray)
(Well maybe it might work out someday)
If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)17Embed
