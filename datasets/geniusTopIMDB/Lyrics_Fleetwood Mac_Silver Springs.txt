Silver Springs Lyrics
You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

Don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know
So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me


Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
You might also like
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me17Embed
