The Ledge Lyrics
Counting on my fingers
Counting on my toes
Slipping thru your fingers
Watching how it grows
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about

Do you ever wonder
Do you ever hate
Six feet under
Someone who can wait
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you
Oughta tell you what it's really all about
You're never gonna to make it baby
Oh I guess I'm gonna make you crazy
Make it babe
Make it babe
Make it babe
Counting on my fingers
Counting on my toes
Slipping thru your fingers
Watching how it grows
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about

Buy another fixture
Tell another lie
Paint another picture
See who's surprised
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
Someone oughta
Someone oughta tell you what it's really all about
You're never going to make it baby
Oh you're never gonna make it crazy
Oh you're never gonna
Make it babe
Make it babe
Make it babe
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
You can love me baby but you can't walk out
