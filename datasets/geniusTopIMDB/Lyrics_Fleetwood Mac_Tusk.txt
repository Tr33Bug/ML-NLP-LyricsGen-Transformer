Tusk Lyrics
How are the tenders, Johnny?

Why don't you ask him if he's gonna stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?

Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him the latest on his throne?
(Ooga-aga-ooga)

Don't say that you love me (Hiyee)
Just tell me that you want me (Hiyee)
Tusk!
Just say that you want me (Hiyee)
Don't tell me that youâ€”

Tusk!
(Real savage-like)

Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Tusk! Tusk!You might also like10Embed
