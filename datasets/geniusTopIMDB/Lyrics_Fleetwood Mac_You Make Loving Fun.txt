You Make Loving Fun Lyrics
Sweet wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

Don't, don't break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You, you make loving fun
And I don't have to tell you but you're the only one

You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)
You, you make loving fun (It's all I want to do)You might also like12Embed
