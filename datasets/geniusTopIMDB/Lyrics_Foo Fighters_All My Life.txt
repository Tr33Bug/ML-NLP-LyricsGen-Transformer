All My Life Lyrics
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothing to hide
On and on, I got nothing to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Then I'm done, done, on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next—
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next—

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, and I'm done, and I'm on to the next22Embed
