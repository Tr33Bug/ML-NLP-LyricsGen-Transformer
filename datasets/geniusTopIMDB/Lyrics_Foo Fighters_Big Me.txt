Big Me Lyrics
When I talk about it
Carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons all renew

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true
Well, I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew
But it's you I fell into

Well, I talked about it
Carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talked about it
Aries or treasons all renew

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

Well, I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into

Well, I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into
I fell into
I fell intoYou might also like4Embed
