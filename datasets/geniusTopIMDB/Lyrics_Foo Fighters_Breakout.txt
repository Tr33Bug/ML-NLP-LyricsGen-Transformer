Breakout Lyrics
You make me dizzy running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down
Well, look who's going crazy now
We're face to face my friend
Better get out
Better get out

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
You can see this on my face, it's all for you
The more and more I take I break right through
Therapy still scares me, putting me on my back again

I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days I'll phase you out
Burn it in the blast off, burn it in the blast off
Watching me crawl away
Try to get out, try to get out

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

Break out
Break out
Break out
Break out
Go, go, go!
You might also like
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't want to look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
Make me break out
