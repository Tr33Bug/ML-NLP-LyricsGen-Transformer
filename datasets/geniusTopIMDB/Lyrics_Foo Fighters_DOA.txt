DOA Lyrics
Oh, you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waited and I waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline

I was down, and I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever 'cause nothing lasts
Dancing with the bones of my buried past
Never mind, there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time

I'm finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats this fast

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

Never mind, there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killing you
You might also like
It's a shame we have to die my dear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time

Ain't no way, DOA
Ain't no way, DOA

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

Never mind, there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
It's a shame we have to disappear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
This time
This time2Embed
