February Stars Lyrics
I'm hanging on
Here until I'm gone
Right where I belong
Just hanging on

Even though
I watched you come and go
How was I to know
You'd steal the show?
One day
I'll have enough to gamble
I'll wait to hear your final call
And bet it all

I'm hanging on
Here until I'm gone
Right where I belong
Just hanging on

Even though
I pass this time alone
Somewhere so unknown
It heals the soul

You ask for walls, I'll build them higher
We'll lie in the shadows of them all
I'd stand but they're much too tall
And I fall

February stars
Floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars
Floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars
Floating in the dark
Temporary scars
