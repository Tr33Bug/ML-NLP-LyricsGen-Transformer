Friend of a Friend Lyrics
He needs a quiet room
With a lock to keep him in
It's just a quiet room
And he's there

He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friend's guitar
That he played
He's never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He says "Nevermind"
And no one speaks

He thinks he drinks too much
'Cause when he tells his two best friends
"I think I drink too much"
No one speaks
No one speaks
No one speaks

He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friend's guitar
That he played

When he plays
No one speaks
No one speaks
When he plays
No one speaks
