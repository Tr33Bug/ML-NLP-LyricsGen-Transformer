Happy Ever After (Zero Hour) Lyrics
The sun went down on another perfect day
Busy counting shadows on the wall
The weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
Roses in the whiskey jar, blood on the thorns
Drink until the taste is gone
Cracks in the floorboards are deep from dancing
To the sound of candles burning out
Heavy from writing your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes, blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone
Where is your Shangri-La now?
Where is your Shangri-La now?
Counting down to zero hours

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, counting down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, counting down to zero hour


Where is your Shangri-La now? (Where's your Shangri-La?)
Where is your Shangri-La now? (Where's your Shangri-La?)
Counting down to zero hours

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, counting down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, counting down to zero hourYou might also like3Embed
