Hey, Johnny Park! Lyrics
Come and I'll take you under
This beautiful bruise's colors
Everything fades in time, it's true
Wish that I had another
Stab at the undercover
Was it a change in mind for you?

(It's impossible) I can't let it out
(You'll never know) Am I selling you out?
(Sit and watch) Your every move, move
Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue

(It's impossible) I can't let it out
(You'll never know) Am I selling you out?
(Sit and watch) Your every move, move
Move, move

Now that I've found my reward
I'd throw it away long before
I'd share a piece of mind with you

(It's impossible) I can't let it out
(You'll never know) Am I selling you out?
(Sit and watch) Your every move, move
Move, moveYou might also like4Embed
