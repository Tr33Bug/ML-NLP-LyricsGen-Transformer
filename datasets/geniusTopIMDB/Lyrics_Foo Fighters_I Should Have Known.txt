I Should Have Known Lyrics
I should've known that it would end this way
I should've known there was no other way
Didn't hear your warning, damn my heart gone deaf
I should've known, look at the shape you're in
I should've known, but I dove right in
One thing is for certain, as I'm standin' here, I should've known

Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt

I should've known, I was inside of you
I should've known there was that side of you
Came without a warning, caught me unaware
I should've known, I've been here before
I should've known, don't want it anymore
One thing is for certain, I'm still standin' here, I should've known

Lay your hands in mine
Feel me one last time

No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt, I should have known

Maybe you was right, didn't wanna fight
I should have known
Couldn't read the signs, couldn't see the light
I should have known

No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave us all in debt, I should have known3Embed
