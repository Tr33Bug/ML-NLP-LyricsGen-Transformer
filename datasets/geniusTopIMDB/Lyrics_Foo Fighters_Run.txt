Run Lyrics
Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
The rats are on parade, another mad charade
What you gonna do?
The hounds are on the chase, everything's erased
What you gonna do?
I need some room to breathe, you can stay asleep
If you wanted to
They say that's nothing's free, you can run with me
If you wanted to
Yeah, you can run with me
If you wanted to

Before the time runs out
There's somewhere to run
Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
Run
You might also like
We are the nation's stakes, if everything's erased
What you gonna do?
I need some room to breathe, you can run with me
If you wanted to
Yeah, you can run with me
If you wanted to

Before the time runs out
There's somewhere to run
Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
Run

Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me
In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
