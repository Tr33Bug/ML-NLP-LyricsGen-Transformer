Sunday Rain Lyrics
You say I take it for granted
I say you've taken it all
Say you can take it or leave it
You got your head in the ceiling
When are you gonna come down?
When you're that high, can you feel it?

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
You wanna tell me a secret
You think I'm gonna find out
You tell the lie, you should keep it
Don't wanna know where it's leading
Don't want to follow you 'round
My first mistake was believing

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away? (Do you give it away?)
Do you let go? (Do you let go?)
Where do you find it? Oh

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
You might also like
A little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Try to let go?
How do you find it? Oh
A little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
How do you find it?
A little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
