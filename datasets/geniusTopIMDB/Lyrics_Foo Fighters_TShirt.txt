T-Shirt Lyrics
I don't wanna be king
I just wanna sing a love song
Pretend there's nothing wrong
You can sing along with me
I don't wanna be queen
Just trying to keep my t-shirt clean

There's one thing that I have learned
If it gets much better, it's going to get worse
And you get what you deserve
And you get what you deserveYou might also likeEmbed
