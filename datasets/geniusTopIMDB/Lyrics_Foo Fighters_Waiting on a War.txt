TranslationsPortuguêsWaiting on a War Lyrics
I've been waiting on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
Never really wanted to be number one
Just wanted to love everyone

Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this, more to this
More to this than
Just waiting on a war?
Just waiting on a war?

Every day waiting for the sky to fall
Big crash on a world that's so small
Just a boy with nowhere left to go
Fell in love with a voice on the radio

Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this, more to this
More to this than

Just waiting on a war?
Just waiting on a war?

Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that

(Oohhhh)

I've been waiting on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun

Is there more to this, more to this
More to this than

Just waiting on a war?
Just waiting on a war?

Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
'Cause I need more
Yeah, I need more
Just waiting on a war
Just waiting on a war
Yeah, I need more (For this and that)
(There's got to be more to this than that)
(Just waiting on a war) Yeah, I need more (For this and that)
(There's got to be more to this than that)
