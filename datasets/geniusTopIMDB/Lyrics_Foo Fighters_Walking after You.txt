Walking after You Lyrics
Tonight I'm tangled in my blanket of clouds
Dreaming aloud
Things just won't do without you
Matter of fact

Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh, I'm on your back
I'm on your back
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh, I'm on your back
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you

If you'd accept surrender, I'll give up some more
Weren't you adored
I cannot be without you
Matter of fact

Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh, I'm on your back
I'm on your back
Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh, I'm on your back

If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you

Another heart is cracked
In two
I'm on your back
You might also like
I cannot be without you
Matter of fact

Oh-woah-oh-oh, oh, I'm on your back

If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you

Another heart is cracked
In two
I'm on your back5Embed
