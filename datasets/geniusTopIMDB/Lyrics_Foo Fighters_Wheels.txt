Wheels Lyrics
One, two, three, four

I know what you're thinking
We were going down
I can feel the sinking
But then I came around

And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothing mattered anymore
I looked into the sky
Well I wanted something better man
I wished for something new
And I wanted something beautiful
And wish for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

Know your head is spinning
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginning
Coming to an end

Well you wanted something better man
You wished for something new
Well you wanted something beautiful
You wished for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose
You might also like
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)4Embed
