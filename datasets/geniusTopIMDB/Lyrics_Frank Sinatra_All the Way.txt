All the Way Lyrics
When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you
All the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you
All the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real
When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you
All the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years
Come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the way


So if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the wayYou might also likeEmbed
