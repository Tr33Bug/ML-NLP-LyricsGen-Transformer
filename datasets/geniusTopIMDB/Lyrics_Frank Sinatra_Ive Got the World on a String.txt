Iâ€™ve Got the World on a String Lyrics
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go

I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go

I got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
And this is the life
Hey now
I'm so in loveYou might also like2Embed
