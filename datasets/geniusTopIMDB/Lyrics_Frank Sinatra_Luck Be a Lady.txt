Luck Be a Lady Lyrics
They call you Lady Luck
But there is room for doubt
At times, you have a very un-ladylike way of running out
You're on this date with me
The pickin's have been lush
And yet, before this evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, be a lady tonight
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck, be a lady tonight

Luck, let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck, be a lady with me
A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice
Let's keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the fella you came in with
Luck, be a lady tonight
A lady never flirts with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd be nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice
Let's keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be a lady tonightYou might also like4Embed
