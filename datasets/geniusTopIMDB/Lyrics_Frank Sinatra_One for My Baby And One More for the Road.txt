One for My Baby (And One More for the Road) Lyrics
It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place, 'cept you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I got a little story I think you should know
We're drinkin' my friend
To the end, of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
Feelin' so bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad?
I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy
Won't you listen to me
'Til it's talked away?

Well, that's how it goes
And Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned
Or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

The long, it's so long
The long, very longYou might also likeEmbed
