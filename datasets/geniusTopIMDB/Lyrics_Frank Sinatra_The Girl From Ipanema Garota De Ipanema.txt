The Girl From Ipanema (Garota De Ipanema) Lyrics
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes  "ooh"
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesn't see, doesn't see

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar

Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado parece um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar..

Ooh, but I watch her so sadly
Ah, porque tudo é tão triste

Yes, I would give my heart gladly

But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesn't see

Por causa do amor

She just doesn't see

Nem olha para mim

She never sees me
Por causa do amorYou might also like3Embed
