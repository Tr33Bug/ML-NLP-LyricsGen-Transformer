The Shadow Of Your Smile LyricsThe shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things, you are, to me
Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so, so did i
Now when I remember spring
And every little lovely thing
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Your lovely smileYou might also likeEmbed
