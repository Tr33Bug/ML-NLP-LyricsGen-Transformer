Abacab Lyrics
Look up on the wall
There on the floor
Under the pillow
Behind the door
There's a crack in the mirror
Somewhere there's a hole in a window-pane
Now do you think I'm to blame
Tell me do you think I'm to blame

(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab)
If you're wrappin'
Up the world
'Cause you've taken
Someone else's girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Don't you think they'll find out
Tell me don't you think they'll find out

(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
(Abacab) doesn't really care

You want it, you've got it, you've gotta go
You want it, you've got it, now you know

It's an illusion
It's a game
A reflection
Of someone else's name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane
You might also likeWell, there's a hole in there somewhere
Yeah, there's a hole in there somewhere
Baby, there's a hole in there somewhere
Now there's a hole in there somewhere

(When they do it) you're never there
(When they show it) you stop and stare
(Abacab) isn't anywhere
