Counting Out Time LyricsI'm counting out time
Got the whole thing down by numbers
All those numbers
Give me guidance
Oh Lord, I need that now
The Day of Judgement's come
And you can bet that I've been resting
For this testing
Digesting every word the experts say
Erogenous zones, I love you
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Found a girl I wanted to date
Thought I'd better get it straight
Went to buy a book before it's too late
Don't leave nothing to fate
I studied every line
Every page in the book
And now, I've got the real thing here
I'm gonna take a look, take a look
(This is it, Rael)
I'm counting out time
Hoping it goes like I planned it
'Cause I understand it
Look, I've found the hotspots, figures 1 to 9
Still counting out time
I got my finger on the button
Don't say nothin'
Just lie there still
And I'll get you turned on just fine
Erogenous zones, I love you
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Touch and go with 1 to 6
Bit of trouble in zone number 7
Gotta remember all of my tricks
There's heaven ahead in number 11
Getting crucial responses
With dilation of the pupils
Honey, get hip! It's time to unzip
To unzip, zip, zip-a-zip-a-zip
Whoopee!

(Move over, Casanova)
I'm counting out time
Reaction none too happy
Please don't slap me
I'm a red-blooded male
And the book said I could not fail
I'm counting out time
I got unexpected distress
From my mistress
I'll get my money back
From the bookstore right away
Erogenous zones, I question you
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Without you, what would a poor boy do?
Without you, mankind handkinds
