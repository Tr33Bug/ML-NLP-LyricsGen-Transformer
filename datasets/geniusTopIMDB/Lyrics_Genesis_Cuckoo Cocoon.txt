Cuckoo Cocoon Lyrics
Wrapped up in some powdered wool
I guess I'm losing touch
Don't tell me this is dying
Cause I ain't changed that much
The only sound is water drops
I wonder where the hell I am
Some kind of jam?

Cuckoo cocoon
Have I come to, too soon for you?
There's nothing I can recognize
This is nowhere that I've known
With no sign of life at all
I guess that I'm alone
And I feel so secure
That I know this can't be real
But I feel good

Cuckoo cocoon
Have I come to, too soon for you?

I wonder if I'm a prisoner
Locked in some Brooklyn jail
Or some sort of Jonah
Shut up inside the whale
No I'm still Rael and I'm stuck
In some kind of cave
What could've saved me?

Cuckoo cocoon
Have I come to, too soon for you?You might also likeEmbed
