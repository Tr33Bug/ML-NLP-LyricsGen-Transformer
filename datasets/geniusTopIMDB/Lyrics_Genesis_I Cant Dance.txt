I Canâ€™t Dance Lyrics
Hot sun beatin' down
Burnin' my feet just walkin' around
Hot sun makin' me sweat
Gator's gettin' close, hasn't got me yet

I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standin' here sellin' everything
Blue jeans sittin' on the beach
Her dog's talkin' to me but she's out of reach
She's got a body under that shirt
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt

'Cause I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standin' here sellin'...

Oh and checkin' everything is in place
You never know who's lookin' on

Young punk spillin' beer on my shoes
Fat guys talkin' to me tryna steal my blues
Thick smoke, see her smilin' through
I never thought so much could happen just shootin' pool

But I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standin' here sellin'...
You might also like
Oh and checkin' everything is in place
You never know who's lookin' on
A perfect body with a perfect face, mhm

No, I can't dance, I can't talk
The only thing about me is the way I walk
No, I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standin' here sellin' everything

But I can walk
No, I can't dance
No-no-no, I can't dance
No, I said I can't sing
But I can walk5Embed
