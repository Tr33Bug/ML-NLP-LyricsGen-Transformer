Ripples Lyrics
Blue girls come in every size
Some are wise and some otherwise
They got pretty blue eyes
For an hour a man may change
For an hour her face looks strange
Looks strange, looks strange
Marching to the promised land
Where the honey flows
And takes you by the hand
Pulls you down on your knees
While you're down a pool appears
The face in the water looks up
And she shakes her head as if to say
That it's the last time you'll look like today
Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
Gone to the other side
Sail away, away

The face that launched a thousand ships
Is sinking fast, that happens you know
The water gets below, seems not very long ago
Lovelier she was than any that I know
Angels never know it's time
To close the book
And gracefully decline
The song has found a tale
My, what a jealous pool is she
The face in the water looks up
She shakes her head as if to say
That the blue girls have all gone away

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
They've gone to the other side
Look into the pool, ripples never come back
Dive to the bottom and go to the top
To see where they have gone
They've gone to the other side
You might also like

Sail away, away
Ripples never come back
Gone to the other side
Look into the pool, the ripples never come back, come back
Dive to the bottom and go to the top
To see where they have gone
They've gone to the other side

Ripples never come back
Sail away, away
Sail away, away
Ripples never come back2Embed
