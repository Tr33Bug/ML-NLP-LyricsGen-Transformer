Thatâ€™s All Lyrics

Just as I thought, it was goin' alright
I found out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
I could say day, and you'd say night
Tell me it's black, when I know that it's white
Always the same, it's just a shame, and that's all

I could leave, but I won't go, though my heart might tell me so
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Turnin' me on, turnin' me off
Makin' me feel like I want too much
Livin' with you's just a-puttin' me through it all of the time
Runnin' around, stayin' out all night
Takin' it all instead of takin' one bite
Livin' with you's just a-puttin' me through it all of the time

I could leave, but I won't go, but it'd be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

But why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

Truth is I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in tryin' to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end
You might also like

But I could leave, but I won't go, it'd be easier, I know
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes

So, why does it always seem to be
Me lookin' at you, you lookin' at me
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

But I love you, more than I wanted to
There's no point in tryin' to pretend
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together 'til the end

But just as I thought it was goin' alright
I found out I'm wrong when I thought I was right
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
Well, I could say day, and you'd say night
You tell me it's black when I know that it's white
It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all
That's all
