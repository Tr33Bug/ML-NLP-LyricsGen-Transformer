The Carpet Crawlers Lyrics
There is lambswool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries
Into flame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures
Are trapped in birth on celluloid
The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping they'll find peace
Each thought and gesture
Are caught in celluloid
There's no hiding in my memory
There's no room to avoid
The crawlers cover the floor
In the red ochre corridor
For my second sight of people
They've more lifeblood than before
They're moving in time
To a heavy wooden door
Where the needle's eye is winking
Closing on the poor

The carpet crawlers heed their callers
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

There's only one direction
In the faces that I see
It's upward to the ceiling
Where the chamber's said to be
Like the forest fight for sunlight
That takes root in every tree
They are pulled up by the magnet
Believing they're free
You might also like
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

Mild-mannered supermen
Are held in kryptonite
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle
With their bodies glowing bright
Through the door, a harvest feast
Is lit by candlelight
It's the bottom of a staircase
That spirals out of sight

The carpet crawlers heed their callers
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

The porcelain mannequin
With shattered skin fears attack
And the eager pack lift up their pitchers
They carry all they lack
The liquid has congealed
Which has seeped out through the crack
And the tickler takes his stickleback
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
"We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out"

We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
"We've got to get in to get out"
"We've got to get in to get out"...3Embed
