The Chamber of 32 Doors Lyrics
At the top of the stairs, there's hundreds of people
Running around to all the doors
They try to find, find themselves an audience
Their deductions need applause
The rich man stands in front of me
The poor man behind my back
They believe they can control the game
But the juggler holds another pack

I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust
I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust
I'd rather trust a countryman than a town man
You can judge by his eyes, take a look if you can
He'll smile through his guard, survival trains hard
I'd rather trust a man who works with his hands
He looks at you once, you know he understands
Don't need any shield when you're out in the field

But down here
I'm so alone with my fear
With everything that I hear
And every single door
That I've walked through
Brings me back, back here again
I've got to find my own way

The priest and the magician
Singing all the chants that they have ever heard
And they're all calling out my name
Even academics, searching printed word
My father to the left of me
My mother to the right
Like everyone else, they're pointing
But nowhere feels quite right
You might also like
And I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust
I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust

I'd rather trust a man who doesn't shout what he's found
There's no need to sell if you're homeward bound
If I choose a side, he won't take me for a ride

Back inside
This chamber of so many doors
I've nowhere, nowhere to hide
I'd give you all of my dreams
If you'd help me
Find a door
That doesn't lead me back again

Take me awayEmbed
