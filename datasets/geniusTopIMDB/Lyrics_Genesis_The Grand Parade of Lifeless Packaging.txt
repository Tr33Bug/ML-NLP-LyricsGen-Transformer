The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging Lyrics
"It's the last great adventure
Left to mankind!"
Screams a drooping lady
Offering her dreamdolls
At less than extortionate prices
And as the notes and coins
Are taken out, I'm taken in
To the factory floor

For the Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
The Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse
Got people stocked in every shade
They must be doing well with trade
Stamped, addressed, in odd fatality
That evens out their personality
With profit potential marked by a sign
I can recognize some of the production line
No bite at all in labor bondage
Just wrinkled wrappers on human bandage

The Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
It's the Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse

The hall runs like clockwork
Their hands mark out the time
Empty in their fullness
Like a frozen pantomime
Everyone's a sales representative
Wearing slogans in their shrine
Dishing out failsafe superlatives
Brother John is No. 9

The Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
It's the Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse

And the d√©cor on the ceiling
Has planned out their future day
I see no sign of free will
So I guess I'll have to pay
Pay my way
For the Grand Parade
Oh, it's The Grand Parade
For the Grand Parade

It's the Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
All ready to use
It's the Grand Parade
Of Lifeless Packaging
I just need a fuse
The Grand Parade
For the Grand Parade
The Grand Parade
