The Musical Box Lyrics

Play me "Old King Cole"
That I may join with you
All your hearts now seem so far from me
It hardly seems to matter now

And the nurse will tell you lies
Of a kingdom beyond the skies
But I am lost within this half-world
It hardly seems to matter now
Play me my song
(Here it comes again)
Play me my song
(Here it comes again)

(La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la)
Just a little bit (La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la)
Just a little bit more time (La-la)
Time left to live out my life (La-la, la)
La-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, ah, ah

Play me my song
(Here it comes again)
Play me my song
(Here it comes again)


Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he
So he called for his pipe
And he called for his bowl
And he called for his fiddlers three
But the clock, tick-tock
On the mantelpiece
And I want, and I feel, and I know
And I touch her warmth
You might also like

She is a lady, she's got time
Brush back your hair
(She’s got time, for she’s a lady)
And let me get to know your face
She is a lady, she is mine!
Oh, brush back your hair
(She is mine, she is a lady)
And let me get to know your flesh

I've been waiting here for so long
And all this time has passed me by
It doesn't seem to matter now
You stand there with your fixed expression
Casting doubt on all I have to say
Why don't you touch me, touch me?
Why don't you touch me, touch me?

Touch me now, now, now, now, now!
Now, now, now, now, now!
Now, now, now, now, now!
Now, now, now, now!
Now, now, now, now!5Embed
