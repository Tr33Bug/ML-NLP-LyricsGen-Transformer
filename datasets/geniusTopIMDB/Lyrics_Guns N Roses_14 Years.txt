14 Years Lyrics
I try and feel the sunshine, you bring the rain
You try and hold me down with your complaints
You cry and moan and complain, you whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow the touch you bring

You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say and you know
I've been the beggar, I've played the thief
I was the dog they all tried to beat
But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

Your stupid girlfriends tell you, that I'm to blame
Well, they're all used up has-beens out of the game
This time I'll have the last word, you hear what I say?
I tried to see it your way, it won't work today

You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say, you know
I've been the dealer hangin' on your street
I was the dog they all tried to beat

But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

Bullshit and contemplation, gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth, what would they say?
Well I'm past the point of concern, it's time to play
These last four years of madness sure put me straight
You might also like
You don't get back 14 years in just one day
So hard to keep my own head, just go away, you know
Just like a hooker, she said, "Nothin's for free"
Oh, I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way1Embed
