Ainâ€™t It Fun Lyrics
Ain't it fun when you're always on the run?
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become?
Ain't it fun when you get so high, well, that you, you just can't cum?
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?
It's such fun

Good fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah, fun, such fun, such
Ow
Ain't it fun when you're taking care of number one?
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun?
Ain't it fun when you - just - can't seem to find your tongue?
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun

Well, somebody come up to me, and spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it, it happened so fast

Such fun, such fun, such fun
Such fun, such fun, such fun, fun
Such fun, such fun, such fun, yeah
Such fun, such fun, such

Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt?
Ain't it fun when she splits and leaves you on the bum?
Well, ain't it fun when you've broken up every band that you've ever begun?
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?
It's such fun

Such fun, such fun, such fun, fun, fun
Such fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Such fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Such fun, such fun, such fun
Such fun, ah1Embed
