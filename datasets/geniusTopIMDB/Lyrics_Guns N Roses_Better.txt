Better Lyrics
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

The hardest part this troubled heart has never yet been through now
Was to heal the scars that got their start inside someone like you now
Boy, had I known or I'd been shown back when how long it'd take me
To break the charms that brought me harm and all but would erase me
I never would hope that I could, no matter what you'd pay me
Replay the part, you stole my heart, I should've known you're crazy
If all I knew was that with you, I'd want someone to save me
It'd be enough, but just my luck, I fell in love and maybe
All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better

So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution
This melody inside of me still searches for solution
A twist of fate, the change of heart cures my infatuation
A broken heart, to provide the spark for my determination

No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better
You might also like

I never wanted you to be so full of anger
I never wanted you to be somebody else
I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves
I only wanted you to see things for yourself

All that I wanted was

Now I know you better
Now we all know better

All that I wanted was

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

If I were you, I'd manage to avoid the invitation
Of promised love that can't keep up with your adoration
Just use your head and in the end, you'll find your inspiration
To choose your steps and won't regret this kind of aggravation
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better4Embed
