Chinese Democracy Lyrics
It don't really matter
Gonna find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter, ooh
Gonna leave this thing to somebody else

If they were missionaries
Real-time visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatuation
I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now
'Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
More than you got, to rule the nation
When all I've got is precious time

It don't really matter
Guess I'll keep it to myself
Said, it don't really matter (matter, matter)
It's time I look around for somebody else

'Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all we've got is precious time
More than you got, to fool the nation
But all I've got is precious time


It don't really matter
I guess you'll find out for yourself
No, it don't really matter (matter, matter)
So you can hear it now from somebody else
You might also like
You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat 'em enough, they'll die
It's like a walk in the park from a cell
(It don't' really matter)
Now you're keeping your own kind in hell
(It don't' really matter)
When your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself
(It don't' really matter)
While their arms reach out for your help
And you're out of time4Embed
