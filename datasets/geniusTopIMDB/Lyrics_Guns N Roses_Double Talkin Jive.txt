Double Talkinâ€™ Jive Lyrics
Found a head and an arm in the garbage can
Don't know why I'm here
Livin' on the run for oh so long
I gotta go collect

Double talkin' jive, get the money, motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin' lies
No more patience, man
Back in town, an' a all new friends
They sayin', "How you been?"
Fucked up, and out of place
That's how I felt back then

Double talkin' jive, get the money, motherfucker
'Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin' liar (Lies)
No more patience, man
You dig what I'm sayin'?
