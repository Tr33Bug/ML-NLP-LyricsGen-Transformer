Dust Nâ€™ Bones Lyrics
He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
I-65

She loved him yesterday
Yesterday's over, I said, "Okay, that's alright"
Time moves on, that's the way
We live in hope to see the next day, but that's alright
Sometimes, these things, they are so easy
Sometimes, these things, they are so cold
Sometimes, these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no, man, don't let 'em get to you
Oh yeah, ow, yeah

She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister, she said, "Okay, that's alright"
Buried her things today
Way back out, deep behind the driveway and that's alright

Sometimes, these women are so easy
Sometimes, these women are so cold
Sometimes, these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you
Oh, oh yeah

Get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you forget about your home
And then you're just fucking gone
You might also like

There's no logic here, today
Do as you got to, go your own way, I said, that's right
Time's short, your life's your own
And in the end, we are just

Dust an' bones
Dust an' bones
Dust an' bones
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
An' that's all right, dust an' bone
That's all right, dust an' bone
That's all right, dust an' bone
Just dust an' bones, yeah4Embed
