Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door Lyrics
Ooh, ooh
Hey

Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh-oh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ayy hey yeah
Ooh-oh yeah, oh yeah, aw
Mama, put my guns in the ground (Ooh)
I can't shoot them anymore (Ooh)
That cold black cloud is comin' down (Ooh)
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door (Ooh)

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ayy hey yeah
Ooh


You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation, Jack
Because it's just you against your tattered libido, the bank, and the mortician, forever, man
And it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey-hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh, no, no, no, woah-oh
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, no, no, no, woah, no
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, woah-woah, woah-yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, yeah, ohYou might also like32Embed
