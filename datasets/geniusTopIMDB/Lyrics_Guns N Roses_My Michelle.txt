My Michelle Lyrics

Your daddy works in porno, now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin, but now she's underground
So, you stay out late at night and you do your coke for free
Drivin' your friends crazy with your life's insanity

Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Look out
Sowin all your wild oats in another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday, maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early and this hotel wasn't free
So party 'til your connection calls, honey, I'll return the key

Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Well, well, well, you never can tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle

Everyone needs love
You know that it's true
Someday you'll find someone that'll fall in love with you
But, oh, the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone that you can call your own
But 'til then ya better!

Now you're clean and so discreet I won't say a word
But most of all this song is true, case you haven't heard
So c'mon and stop your cryin', we both know money burns
Honey, don't stop tryin' and you'll get what you deserve
You might also like
Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Well, well, well, you never can tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle, yeah

My, my, my Michelle
My, my, my Michelle
Ooh, my, my, my Michelle
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my Michelle
