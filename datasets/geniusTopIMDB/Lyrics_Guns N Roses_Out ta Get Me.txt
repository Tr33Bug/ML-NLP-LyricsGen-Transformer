Out ta Get Me Lyrics
Been hidin' out and layin' low
It's nothing new to me
Well, you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity

They break down the doors and they rape my rights, but
They won't judge me!
They scream and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me!
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't judge me!
'Cause I got something I've been building up inside
For so fuckin' long!
They're out to get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed

They push me into a corner just to get me to fight, but
They won't judge me!
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me!
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't judge me!
'Cause I got something I've been buildin' up inside
I'm already gone!

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
They won't break me

No
No wow-oh
No-no
No-no-no! No-no-no!
No
No wow-oh
No-no
No-no-no!


Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that a fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me

They're out to get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
So, you can suck me
Take that one to heart4Embed
