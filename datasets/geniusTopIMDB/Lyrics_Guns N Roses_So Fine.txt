So Fine Lyrics
Ooh, ah
Ah

How could she look so fine?
How could it be, she might be mine?
How could she be so cool?
I've been taken for a fool, so many times, hey

It's a story of a man who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns as the story takes its turn
And leaves a broken man
How could she be so cool? Ah
How could she be so fine?
I owe a favor to a friend
My friends, they always come through for me

It's a story of a man who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns as the story takes its turn
And leaves a broken man
If you could only live my life you could see the difference
You make to me, to me

And I'd look right up at night
And all I'd see was darkness
Now, I see the stars, alright
I want to reach right up and grab one for you
When the lights went down in your house
Yeah, that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
Yeah, I think you know where that comes from
Guitar, come on

You might also like
Yeah, when I look right up at night
And all I'd see was darkness
Now, I see the stars, alright
I want to reach right up and grab one for you
When the lights went down in your house
Yeah, that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
I think you know where that comes from

How could she look so good? So good
How could she be so fine?
How could she be so cool?
How could it be, she might be mine?
YeahEmbed
