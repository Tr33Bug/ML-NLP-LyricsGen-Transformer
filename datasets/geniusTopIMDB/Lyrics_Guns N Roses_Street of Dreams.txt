Street of Dreams Lyrics
All the love in the world couldn't save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
Oh, to make you change your mind
And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldn't want to be you
Now there's a hell I can't describe

So now I wander through my days
And try to find my ways to the feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else
And though as long as this road seems
I know it's called the street of dreams
But that's not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste that's bittersweet
That's called the blues, ooh
I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I'd go, I see you
Though it's what you planned
This much is true:
What I thought was beautiful
Don't live inside of you, anymore


I don't know just what I should do
Everywhere I'd go, I see you
Though it's what you planned
This much is true:
What I thought was beautiful
Don't live inside of you, anymore

What this means to me is more than I know you believe
What I thought of you, now, has cost more than it should for me
What I thought was true before, were lies I couldn't see
What I thought was beautiful, is only memories
Oh oh oh
"What'd I tell you?"
Oh oh oh
That's what they'll tell ya
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
