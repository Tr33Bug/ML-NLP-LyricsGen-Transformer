There Was a Time Lyrics
Broken glass and cigarettes writin' on the wall
It was a bargain for the summer and I thought I had it all
I was the one who gave you everythin', the one who took the fall
You were the one who would do anythin', one who can't recall
Where she was while she was sleepin' in another woman's bed
Or the doctor's, or the lawyer's, or a stranger that she met
If there's nothin' I can gain from this or anythin' at all
It'd be the knowledge that you gave me when I thought I'd heard it all

It was a long time for you
It was a long time for me
It'd be a long time for anyone but
Looks like it's meant to be
Social class and registers, cocaine in the hall
All the way from California on the way to your next call
To those non-negotiations to simulate a cause
For the betterment of evils and your ways around the laws
That keep you up and sittin' pretty on a pedestal or bed
An' now you're sleepin' like an angel, never mind who you gave head
If there's somethin' I can make of this or anything at all
It'd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all

It was a wrong time for you
It was a wrong time for me
It was the wrong time for anyone, but
Looks like I got to see for myself

If I could go back in time to the place in my soul
There, all alone, lonely teardrops, ooh, are calling you
But I don't want to know it, now, 'cause knowing you
It won't change a damn thing, but there was a time

Yeah, there was a time, I didn't wanna know, at all
Didn't wanna know, at all, and I don't wanna know it, now
Yeah, there was a time, I didn't wanna know, at all
Didn't wanna know, at all, and I don't wanna know it, now
I would do anything for you, there was a time
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you, there was a time
You might also like

There was a time, I would do anything for you
Ooh, I would do anything for you
(Yeah, there was a time, I didn't wanna know, at all
Didn't wanna know, at all, and I don't wanna know it, now)
I would do anything for you
(Didn't wanna know, at all
Didn't wanna know, at all, and I don't wanna know it, now)
There was a time, there was a timeEmbed
