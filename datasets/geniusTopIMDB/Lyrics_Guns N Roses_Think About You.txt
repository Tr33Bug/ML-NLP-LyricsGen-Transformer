Think About You Lyrics
I said, "Babe, you been lookin' real good"
You know that I remember when we met
It's funny how I never felt so good
It's a feelin' that I know, I know I'll never forget

Oh, it was the best time I can remember
Oh, and the love we shared
Is lovin' that'll last forever
There wasn't much in this heart of mine
But there's a little left and babe you found it
It's funny how I never felt so high
It's a feeling that I know, I know I'll never forget

Oh, it was the best time I can remember
Oh, and the love we shared
Is lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you, honey, all the time, my heart says, "Yes"
I think about you, deep inside, I love you best
I think about you, you know you're the one I want
I think about you, darling, you're the only one
I think about you, yeah! Hahaha

I think about you, you know that I do
I think about you, all alone, only you
I think about you, oh, it's true
I think about you, yes, I do

Somethin' changed in this heart of mine
You know that I'm so glad that you showed me
Honey, now you're my best friend
I want to stay together 'til the very end
You might also like
Ooh, it was the best time I can remember
Oh, and the love we shared
Is lovin' that'll last forever

I think about you, honey, all the time, my heart says, "Yes"
I think about you, deep inside, I love you best
I think about you, you know you're the one I want
I think about you, darling, you're the only one

I think about you, oh-oh yeah
I think about you, oh you
I think about you, woah
Only you
I think about you, you know I do
I think about you, only you
I think about you
Only you
Only
You
