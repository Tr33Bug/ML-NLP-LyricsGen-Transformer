Yesterdays Lyrics
Yesterday, there was so many things I was never told
Now that I'm starting to learn, I feel I'm growing old
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Time just fades the pages in my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket, and no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along with no time to plant my feet
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Some things could be better if we'd all just let them be
Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Got nothing for me, ooh, yeah


Yesterday, there were so many things I was never shown
Suddenly, this time I found I'm on the streets and I'm all alone
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties

Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's, ooh, got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday
