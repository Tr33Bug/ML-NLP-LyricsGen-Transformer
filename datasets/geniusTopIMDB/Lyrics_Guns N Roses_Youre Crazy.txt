Youâ€™re Crazy Lyrics
I've been looking for a trace
Looking for a heart
Looking for a lover in a world
That's much too dark

You don't want my love
You want satisfaction, oh yeah
You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another piece of the action, yeah
Said where you going
What you gonna do
I've been looking everywhere
I've been looking for you

You don't want my love
You want satisfaction, I've got your satisfaction
You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another piece of the action

Because you're crazy, hey hey
You're fucking crazy, oh my
You know you're crazy, oh child
I said you're crazy, ay, ay, yeah
Uh yeah, aow, oh!


Say, boy, where you coming from
Where would you get that point of view
When I was younger
Said I knew someone like you
You might also like
And they said, "You don't want my love"
You want to satisfaction
You don't need my love
You've got to find yourself another piece of the action

'Cause you're crazy, hey hey
You're fucking crazy, oh my
You know you're crazy, oh child
I said you're crazy
Oh, you're crazy
You know you're crazy
Well, you're crazy
You know you're crazy, oh

You know you are
Bring it down
You're fuckin' crazy4Embed
