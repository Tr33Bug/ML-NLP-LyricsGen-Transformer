Alone Too Long LyricsJust a little boy lost looking for a lamb in the all night city
Living in his lonely limousine
And though he never has to worry
He's the only one and only one he's ever gonna need
Absolutely he's in definite need
Of a woman, child, and some better kind of love when the hot town's hurt him
And he knows how happy he could be
But he don't know if he can make it
Between the money and another lonely night
But now the time has come
Got to stay or run
Now the time has come
Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long
And you don't want to be lonely
Another pretty face another body ache still awake three-thirty
Dial another number -- No one home
So then he wastes his time with TV
And he wonders if he lost the only one
And wonders if he's free
Too afraid to see
How alone he could be
Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long
And you don't want to be lonelyYou might also likeEmbed
