Camellia LyricsOpening night, nothing new Atlanta
Into the spotlight, one more time
Just in time to play
To one man and an empty table
He was drinking down the pain
All he could say was this lady's name...
Oh camellia won't you take me away
After the show, when the room was empty
No, he wouldn't go
So I asked him why he called her name
It seems she was some magic one night
With something for his pain
But all she left was a pretty name...
Oh camellia won't you take me away
To paradise tropical moon
Don't you leave me sitting here in AtlantaYou might also likeEmbed
