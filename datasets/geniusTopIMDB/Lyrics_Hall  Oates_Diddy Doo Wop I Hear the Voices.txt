Diddy Doo Wop (I Hear the Voices) Lyrics
Look at me, I'm running, what have I done?
Oh, I must have hurt someone
This darkened subway station give me place to hide
Oh, I hear the voices deep inside
And oh, the voice is singing

Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh oh oh, diddy doo wop, oh oh oh
Well, it's the voice that I hear at the subway stop
Keep singing diddy doo wop, yeah, yeah
Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh oh oh, diddy doo wop, oh oh oh
Well, it starts in my head and it ends when I stop
Keep singing diddy doo wop
Charlie liked the Beatles, Sam, he liked Rich Girl (Bitch Girl)
But I'm still hung up on the Duke of Earl (Duke, duke, duke of earl, duke, duke, duke of earl)
Reaching for the handle, I'm slicing through the air
Oh, the doo wop voices everywhere
And oh, the Duke is singing

Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh oh oh, diddy doo wop, oh oh oh
Well, it's the voice that I hear at the subway stop
Keep singing diddy doo wop, yeah, yeah
Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh oh oh, diddy doo wop, oh oh oh
Well, it starts in my head and it ends when I chop
Keep singing diddy doo wop

Ooh, I hear the voices
Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh oh oh
Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh
Well, it's the voice that I hear at the subway stop
They singing, diddy doo wop
I hear the voices, voices
Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh, I hear the voices
Diddy doo wop
I can't stop, can't stop the voices (i hear the voices)
Aww, they singing
Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Diddy doo wop
I hear the voices
(oh oh oh)
Oh, I can hear them singing (I hear the voices)
Hear the voices
Diddy doo wop
My right hand tried to stop my left hand
(Diddy doo wop)
My left hand tried to stop my right hand
(Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh)
My head keep trying to stop both hands
(I hear the voices)
But i can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
(Diddy doo wop)
I hear the duke singing
(Diddy doo wop, oh oh oh)
Aw, sing duke
Sing it dukeYou might also likeEmbed
