Do What You Want, Be What You Are LyricsDo What You Want, Be What You Are
Do what you want, girl, but be what you are
There ain't no right or wrong way
Just a play from the heart
It ain't a sign of weakness, girl, to give yourself away
Because the strong give up and move on
While the weak, the weak give up and stay
So do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are ...
Do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are ...
Do you believe in hot cars
Leather bars, and movie stars --
Is that what's real?
Payin' dues, in earth shoes, Chicago blues --
Is that how you feel?
You can change, you can change, you can change, you can change
But you can't conceal
What's deep inside you
It's your game, it's your deal
It's your game, it's your deal
So do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are ...
Do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are ...

You can be what you want to
You can do what you want to
You can do, you can be
You could do, you could be
You can...Embed
