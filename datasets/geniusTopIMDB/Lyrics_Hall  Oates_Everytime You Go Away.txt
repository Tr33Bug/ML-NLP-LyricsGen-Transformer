Everytime You Go Away Lyrics
Babe, if we can't solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears?
Whoa, so you go again
When the leading man appears

Always the same thing
But can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on?
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you, you

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
But doesn't mean that much to me

I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

That everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
You just don't care, everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you, you

'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know
That everytime you go away
(Everytime you go away)
(Everytime you go away)
Why you have to go away right now?
(Everytime you go away)
(Everytime you go away)
Go on and go away, girl
(Everytime you go away)
I don't understand why you gotta go, girl
(Everytime you go away)
Go on and go free
Even though you mean so much to me
(Everytime you go away)
I don't understand, baby
(Everytime you go away)
Oh baby, baby, everytime you go
(Everytime you go away)
You don't know, you don't know
Because you never understand, girl
(Everytime you go away)
Why you have to go away right now?
(Everytime you go away)
Everytime you go, girl
(Everytime you go away)
Go on, go on and go free
(Everytime you go away)
Baby, you mean so much to me
I'll never understand why you gotta go, girl
(Everytime you go away)
I don't understand, girl
(Everytime you go away)
I don't know go, I don't know go
I don't know go, I don't know go
I don't know go, I don't know go
(Everytime you go away)
Go girl, go girl, gotta go girl
You won, babe
(Everytime you go away)
Baby, baby, baby
