Family Man Lyrics
She had sulky smile
She took her standard pose as she presented herself
She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain that she was his for a price

But he said, "Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite"
He said, "Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might"
She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her make-up to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night

But he said, "Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite"
He said, "Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might"

She gave him her look
It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldn't decide if he should hold his ground

But he said, "Leave me alone, I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite"
He said, "Leave me alone, I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might"
Yeah

She turned, tossed her head
Unlike her opening move, her final exit line
He waited much too long
But by the time he got his courage up, she was gone
You might also like
And he screamed, "(Leave me alone), I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite"
He said, "(Leave me alone), I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might"

He said, "(Leave me alone), I'm a (Family man)
And I don't think I want it tonight"
And he said, "(Leave me alone), I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might"

He said, "(Leave me alone), I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite"
He said, "(Leave me alone), I'm a family man
If you push me too far, I just might"

He said, "(Leave me alone), I'm a family man
Don't leave me alone 'cause I got to go home
Please (Leave me alone), I'm a family man
And I don't think..."1Embed
