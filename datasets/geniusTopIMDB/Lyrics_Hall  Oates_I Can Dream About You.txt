I Can Dream About You LyricsNo more trying
To hold someone close to my life
It's time for finding
Some way to get through my sleepless nights
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Maybe that will make it all right
All right
Moving sidewalks
Uneven under my feet
My true feelings
Down deep below
'Cause the streets see me lonely for you
Just for you
I can dream about you
In my dreams we're still happy
And you're still part of me
I can dream about you
And when you're in my mind's eye
You're a sweet memory, memory
Baby, I'm dreaming
(I can dream about you)
Dreaming, oh
I can dream about you
Oh, maybe that will make it all right
All right, all right
I can dream about youYou might also likeEmbed
