I Can’t Go for That (No Can Do) Lyrics
Easy, ready, willin’, overtime
Where does it stop?
Where do you dare me
To draw the line?
You've got the body
Now you want my soul
Don't even think about it
Say, “No go”

Yeah, I, I'll do anything
That you want me to
Yeah, I'll do almost anything
That you want me to, ooh
Yeah
But I can't go for that, no (No)
No can do
I can't go for that, no (No)
No can do
I can't go for that, no (No)
No can do
I can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that

I can go for being’ twice as nice
I can go for just repeatin’
The same old lines
Use the body
Now you want my soul
Ooh, forget about it
Now say, “no go”

Yeah, I, I'll do anything
That you want me to
Yeah, I'll do almost anything
That you want me to, ooh
Yeah
