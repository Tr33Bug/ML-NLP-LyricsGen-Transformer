Itâ€™s a Laugh Lyrics
You must be thinkin' something
But you ain't sayin' nothing
You remember me
I used to be your boyfriend
There ain't no point in reason
It only gets defensive
Why should we ruin the purity
Of the moment?

It's a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
What a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid that I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
I really thought that we were special
Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way?
But I just look at myself
As if I were above me
You must be thinking something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me
I have been here always

It's a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
What a laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
I really thought we were special, ohh
We were forever, ahh

It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
It's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
I really thought we were special
You might also like
So special, it's a laugh (It's a laugh)
What a laugh (What a laugh)
It's so stupid, I gotta laugh (Whoo ooh ooh ooh)
And the odd thing is
Everyone thought we were foreverEmbed
