Lady Rain LyricsLady Rain, lay your soppin' hair down on my shoulder
Lady Rain, do your cloudy eyes see me much older?
Can you see my past?
Can you find my future?
Should I take it slower 'til my life is over?
Oh, Lady Rain
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
Lady Rain, lay your soppin' hair down on my shoulder (yeah)
Lady Rain, do your cloudy eyes see me much older?
All the days I've lost hoping and pretending
That my life would flow smooth and slow toward its ending
Oh, Lady Rain
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
(Instrumental break)
Lady Rain, lay your soppin' hair down on my shoulder (lay it down)
Lady Rain, do your cloudy eyes see me much older?
Can you see my past?
Can you find my future?
Should I take it slower 'til my life is over?
Oh, Lady Rain
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
(lady, lady!)
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
(Lady Rain!)
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
(Lady, Lady!)
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
(Lady Rain!)
Is it I who'll be going down in pain? (yeah)
