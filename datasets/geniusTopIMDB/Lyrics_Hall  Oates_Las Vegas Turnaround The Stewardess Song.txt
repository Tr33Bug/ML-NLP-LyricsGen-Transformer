Las Vegas Turnaround (The Stewardess Song) LyricsSara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes she's here and sometimes she can't be found
Turnaround
Sara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes she's here and sometimes she can't be found
Turnaround
And Sara's off, half hiding, far above the clouds, high she flies
I know I've got to find her a place she can push her toes around in
She needs a place where she can lounge and wear a gown in
Sara turnaround, turn, turnaround
Sara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes she's here and sometimes she can't be found
Turnaround
Sara's off on a turnaround
To Las Vegas, sometimes she's not around
Turnaround
And any night
Well, she's here or half way 'round the world, oh I could cry
And so I know I've got to pray for delays and for days 'til she's besides me
All alone in her room and her scattered clothes remind me
Sara please
Sara
Turnaround
Las Vegas turnaround
Sara please
She's gone to Las VegasYou might also likeEmbed
