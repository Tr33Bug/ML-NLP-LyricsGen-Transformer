Method of Modern Love Lyrics
(Love, love, love)
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E

In the moonlight
Under starlight
Songs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are made of a different stuff
I believe love will always be the same (Love)
The ways and means are the parts subject to change

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love

I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face

Style is timeless and fashion's only now (Love, love, love)
We got the ways, no one needs to show us how

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love
(Love)

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
(Love, love)
It's a modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
I know what you're dreaming of
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
What we got is a method of modern love
It's a method of
It's a method of modern love
We know what we do, or don't we (M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E)
We know what we do, or don't we (M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E)
In the moonlight
In the starlight
Songs old as the night
Are what I've been dreamin' of
(It's a method of) It's a method of modern love
Dreams are made of a different stuff (M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E)
And we're living in a method of modern love
At present tense, past, time behind (M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E)
And don't fall for the same old line
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
Don't you know that it's a method of modern love?
I've got the way we work (M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E)
I've got a way we run
I do believe that I'm inclined to look ahead and not behind
(M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E)
I got the method, baby, and it's right on time
And it's a method of modern love
(It's a method of modern love)
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
I know what you're dreaming of
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
Ooh
It's a method of modern love
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
Don't mess with imperfection
