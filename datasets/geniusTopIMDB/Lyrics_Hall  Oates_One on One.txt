One on One Lyrics
I'm tired of playing on the team
Ooh, it seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace, face to face
No one even trying to score
Oh, oh, I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh, yeah, you've got to understand, baby
Time out is what I'm here for

One on one, I wanna play that game tonight
One on one, I know I wanna play that
One on one, I wanna play that game tonight
One on one, so slow, ooh
You can't tell me you don't miss me girl, no
I think I might know you too well, oh I
Wonder what you'd say if you knew that I was coming tonight
(Want to) I want you can't you tell? Ooh

One on one, I wanna play that game tonight
One on one, I know I wanna play that
One on one, I wanna play that game tonight
One on one, so slow

That's all you need to know now
'Cause if it's really right there's nothing else

One on one, I wanna play that game tonight, ooh
One on one, I know I wanna play that game tonight (One on one, ooh)
One on one, I wanna play that game tonight (One on one, I wanna play that game tonight)
One on one, I wanna play that game, one on one, on one (One on one, on one, on one)

Girl, ooh, there's nothing else but you and me (On one)
I want no one else, I don't want no one else (On one)
Ooh, baby, I'm tired of playing, I'm tired of playing (On one)
Ooh, I don't wanna play those games no more, no more (On one)
I wanna play with you, girl (On one), I wanna play with you, girl (On one)
Just you and me, you and me, you and me (On one)You might also like3Embed
