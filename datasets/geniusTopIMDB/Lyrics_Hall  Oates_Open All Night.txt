Open All Night Lyrics
I know how you spent your time
Too many people know you weren't alone
Your after hours followed you home
Oh, I heard, he said

She was open all night
While I was away, you were open all night
Don't ask me to tell you who told me
She was open all night
While I was away, you were open all night
Don't ask me to tell you who said
Gotta lotta friends that I don't need
They say, "You'd rather hear it first from me"
Maybe I don't wanna hear it at all
It's too far to fall, so don't say

She was open all night
While I was away
You were open all night (Open all night)
Don't ask me to tell you who told me
She was open all night (Open all night)
Ooh, while I was away
You were open all night (Open all night)
Don't ask me to tell you who said

(Don't ask me to tell you)
Baby, I don't wanna know
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
Please, don't tell me, you don't have to say no more
(Don't ask me to tell you)
Don't ask me, girl, don't ask me, girl, ooh
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
You were open all night
(Don't ask me to tell you)
I know how you spend your time
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
Oh, they told me, you were getting outta line, oh
(Don't ask me to tell you)
Baby, it's too far to fall
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
I don't wanna hear it at all, oh
(Don't ask me to tell you)
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
(Don't ask me to tell you)
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
(Don't ask me to tell you)
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
(Don't ask me to tell you)
(No, I don't wanna tell you)
(Don't ask me to tell you)
(No, I don't wanna tell you)You might also likeEmbed
