Out of Touch (12" Version) Lyrics
Out of touch, out of touch
Out of touch, out of touch
Out of touch, out of time, girl

You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch (Smoking guns)
Would cool down if we didn't use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me (Matters to me)
Too much (Too much)
You might also like
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oooh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Out of touch, out of touch
Out of time, out of time
Ow!

Out of touch, out of touch
Out of touch, out of touch
Out of touch, out of time, girl


You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around (Around)
You're out of touch (We're soul alone, girl)
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (Out of touch)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around (Out of time, out of touch, out of time, girl)
You're out of touch (Reach out for something to hold)
Time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around (Too cold, girl)
You're out of touch (Too cold, girl)
I'm out of time (Too cold, girl)
(Yeah) Not around

You're out of touch
Yeah, I'm out of time (Time)
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch ()
I'm out of time (Time)
We'll still be one
Someday, somehow, girl
Out of touch, out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
When you're not around (When you're not around)
When you're not around (When you're not around)
When you're not around, not around
Girl, you're not around, no, no
I'm out of touch
Shake it up, girl
That's all we knew
These other things
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
Time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
Not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head when you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of timeEmbed
