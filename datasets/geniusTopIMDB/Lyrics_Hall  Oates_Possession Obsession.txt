Possession Obsession Lyrics
You know there's something you need
Right here and now
To fill the space inside of yourself
Oh, with money, love or power
When you want to have the number one, first-run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them
You ought to know better than that, girl
The more that you buy, the less you get back

You could say
It's a case of possession obsession
Just a taste of possession obsession
Ooh, brings of a case of possession
I hear you say gimme, gimme
Now gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
The compulsion to count, the percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
Oh, all the good times suffer
Though you know it's only jealousy
But you can't help but be haunted by your passion
Now, don't you know it's a matter of fact
The more that you take, the less you give back

I can say
It's a case of possession obsession
Just a taste of possession obsession
Ooh, brings of a case of possession
I hear you say gimme, gimme
Now gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, ooh yeah, possession
Ooh, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme


Ooh, it's a case of possession obsession
Just a taste of possession obsession
Oh, brings of a case of possession
I hear you say possession
Now, don't you know it's a matter of fact
The more that you take (Gimme some)
The less you give back, yeah, yeah
Possession
The possession, oh, the possession, oh
(Gimme some) Gimme some
Just a taste of possession obsession
Gimme, gimme, yeah
(Gimme some) Gimme some
Possession
Just a case of, just a taste of
Just a case of possession obsession
Possession
Gimme someYou might also likeEmbed
