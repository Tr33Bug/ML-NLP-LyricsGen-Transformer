Private Eyes Lyrics
I see you, you see me
Watch you blowing the lines when you're making a scene
Oh, girl, you've got to know
What my head overlooks the senses will show
To my heart, when it's watching for lies
You can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you, watching you, watching you, watching you
You play with words, you play with love
You can twist it around, baby, that ain't enough
'Cause girl, I'm gonna know
If you're letting me in or letting me go
Don't lie when you're hurting inside
'Cause you can't escape my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move, baby
Private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you, watching you, watching you, watching you


Ooh, why you try to put up a front for me?
I'm a spy but on your side, you see
Slip on into any disguise
I'll still know you, look into my

Private eyes
They're watching you
They see your every move
Oh babe, private eyes
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you
You might also like
Private eyes
They're watching you, yeah
They see your every move, they see it
Private eyes, oh
They're watching you
Private eyes
They're watching you

Private eyes, ooh
Watching you, yeah
They see your every move, they see you
Private eyes
They're watching you
Your private eyes
They're watching you

Private eyes
Watching you
They watch your every move, girl
Every move
Oh I see you, oh I see you
Private eyes
Private, private, private eyes, girl
Watching you
Eyes
They're watching you, watching you
Private eyes
Watching you
Every move
They see your private eyes, yeah
Watching you3Embed
