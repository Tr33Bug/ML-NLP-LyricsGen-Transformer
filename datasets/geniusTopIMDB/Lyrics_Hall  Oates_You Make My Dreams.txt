You Make My Dreams Lyrics
What I want, you've got and it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle, the candle feeds the flame
Yeah, what I've got, full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together, and how, I can't explain

Well, well, well, you
You make my dreams come true
You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you
Oh yeah, you make my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer, I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me and I'll never be the same

Well, well, well, you
You make my dreams come true
You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Well, well, well you
You make my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)

Well, listen to this
Ow!

I'm down on my daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know

Well, well, well, you
You make my dreams come true
You (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
You might also like
Oh yeah, I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh yeah, you make a-my dreams come true
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Me, you, me, you, me
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Oh my, you make a-my dreams come true
(You) Oh (You, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Whoa ooh whoa, I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting
You make my dreams
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I've been waiting for you, girl
(Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
You make my dreams
(You, you, you, ooh ooh ooh, you)12Embed
