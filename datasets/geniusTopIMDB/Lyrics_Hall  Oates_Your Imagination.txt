Your Imagination Lyrics
I remember when I used to be the jealous kind
I got over it, now you're taking over my old line

You're caring too much about what I say (Your imagination)
You're wondering too much about what I do (Your imagination)
And baby, your imagination now (Your imagination)
Imagination's got the best of you (Your imagination)

I ain't doin' nothing that you could really say was wrong
Just one oversight and no, that didn't last too long
You're caring too much about what I say (Your imagination)
You're wondering too much about what I do (Your imagination)
And baby, your imagination now (Your imagination)
Imagination's got the best of you (Your imagination)

I don't know what you're looking for, woah
What's this thing all about "true blue", oh yeah
You know I ain't no danger boy
'Cause you're the one I like to touch, touch you
You, you, you


Yeah, when the mood is right
Change the light and the moment's gone
You better turn around, 'cause the light doesn't last too long

You see, you're caring too much about what I say (Your imagination)
You're wondering too much about what I do (Your imagination)
And baby, your imagination now (Your imagination)
Imagination's got the best of you (Your imagination)
You might also like
Your imagination (Use your imagination)
Oh, your imagination (Use your imagination)
Oh baby, your imagination (Use your imagination)
Oh baby, your imagination (Use your imagination)
Baby, baby, your imagination (Use your imagination)
Baby, baby, your imagination (Use your imagination)
Oh baby, oh baby
Your imagination
