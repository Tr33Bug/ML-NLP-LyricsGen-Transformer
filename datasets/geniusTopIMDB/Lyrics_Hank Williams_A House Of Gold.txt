A House Of Gold Lyrics
People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
Don't they know on the judgement day
That their gold and silver will melt away

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
Jesus said, come on to me
I'll break sin's chains and set you free
I'll carry you to a home on high
Where you'll never, never die

What good is gold and silver, too
When your heart's not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Jesus died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Sinner hear now what I say
For someday you'll have to pay

What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not good and true
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and prayYou might also likeEmbed
