A House Of Gold Lyrics[Verse 1]
People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
Don't they know on the judgement day
That their gold and silver will melt away

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
[Verse 3]
Jesus said, come on to me
I'll break sin's chains and set you free
I'll carry you to a home on high
Where you'll never, never die

[Chorus]
What good is gold and silver, too
When your heart's not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

[Verse 4]
Jesus died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Sinner hear now what I say
For someday you'll have to pay

[Chorus]
What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not good and true
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and prayYou might also likeEmbed
