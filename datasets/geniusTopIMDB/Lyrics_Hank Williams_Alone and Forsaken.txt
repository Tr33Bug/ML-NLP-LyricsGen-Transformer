Alone and Forsaken Lyrics[Verse 1]
We met in the springtime
When blossoms unfold
The pastures were green
And the meadows were gold

[Verse 2]
Our love was in flower
As summer grew on
Her love, like the leaves
Now has withered and gone
[Verse 3]
The roses have faded
There's frost at my door
The birds in the morning
Don't sing anymore

[Verse 4]
The grass in the valley
Is starting to die
And out in the darkness
The whip-poor-wills cry

[Chorus]
Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh, lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh, please understand

[Verse 5]
Oh, where has she gone to
Oh, where can she be?
She may have forsaken
Some other like me

[Verse 6]
She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow was a plaything
That she threw away
You might also like[Verse 7]
The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance
Is starting to bay

[Verse 8]
I wonder, I wonder
What she's thinking of?
Forsaken, forgotten
Without any love

[Chorus]
Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh, lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh, please understand4Embed
