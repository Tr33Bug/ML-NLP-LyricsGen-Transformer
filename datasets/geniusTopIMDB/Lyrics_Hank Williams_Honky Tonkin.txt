Honky Tonkinâ€™ Lyrics
When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go
Come to see me, baby, and bring along some dough

And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

When you and your baby have a fallin' out
Call me up, sweet mama, and we'll go steppin' out

And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town


We're goin' into the city, to the city fair
If you go to the city, baby, you will find me there

And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town


We're goin' honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We're goin' honky tonkin' 'round this townYou might also likeEmbed
