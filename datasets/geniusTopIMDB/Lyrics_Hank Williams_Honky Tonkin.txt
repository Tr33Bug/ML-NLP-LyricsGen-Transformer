Honky Tonkinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go
Come to see me, baby, and bring along some dough

[Chorus]
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

[Pedal Steel Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
When you and your baby have a fallin' out
Call me up, sweet mama, and we'll go steppin' out

[Chorus]
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

[Fiddle Solo]

[Verse 3]
We're goin' into the city, to the city fair
If you go to the city, baby, you will find me there

[Chorus]
And we'll go honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We'll go honky tonkin' 'round this town

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
We're goin' honky tonkin', honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin', honey baby
We're goin' honky tonkin' 'round this townYou might also likeEmbed
