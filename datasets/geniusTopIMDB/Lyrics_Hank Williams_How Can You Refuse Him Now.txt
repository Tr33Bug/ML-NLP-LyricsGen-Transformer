How Can You Refuse Him Now LyricsHow can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
There's a story old, that has often been told
Of how our Saviour died, as they nailed His hands
He cried they don't understand
As the blood flowed from His side
How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
As He hung there on the tree, He prayed for you and me
There was no one His pain to ease
Before He died, He faintly cried
Father forgive them please
How can you refuse Him now, how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes, on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus nowYou might also likeEmbed
