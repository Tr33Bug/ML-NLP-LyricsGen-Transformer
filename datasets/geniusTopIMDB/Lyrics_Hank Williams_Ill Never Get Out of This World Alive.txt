I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive LyricsNow you're lookin' at a man that's gettin' kind-a mad
I had lots of luck but it's all been bad
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive

My fishin' pole's broke the creek is full of sand
My woman run away with another man
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
A distant uncle passed away
And left me quite a batch
And I was living high until that fatal day
A lawyer proved I wasn't born, I was only hatched
Every thing's agin' me and it's got me down
If I jumped in the river I would probably drown
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world alive
These shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time
Is full of holes and nails
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails

I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright no-how
No matter how I struggle and strive
I'll never get out of this world aliveYou might also like2Embed
