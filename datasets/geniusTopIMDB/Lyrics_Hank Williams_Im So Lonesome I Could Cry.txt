Iâ€™m So Lonesome I Could Cry Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Verse 2]
I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry
[Verse 3]
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me, he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Verse 4]
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cryYou might also like8Embed
