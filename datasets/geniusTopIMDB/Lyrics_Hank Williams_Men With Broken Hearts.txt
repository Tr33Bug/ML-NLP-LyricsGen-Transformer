Men With Broken Hearts LyricsYou'll meet many just like me upon life's busy street
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low
And eyes that stare in defeat
Or souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts
Where a living death is all that's left for men with broken hearts

You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts
Oh so humble you should be when they come passing by
For it's written that the greatest men never get too big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts
And with hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts

You've never walked in that man's shoes
Or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands
While the heart inside you dies
Some were paupers some were kings
And some were masters of the arts
But in their shame they're all the same
These men with broken hearts

Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath
So help your brother along the road no matter where he starts
For the God that made you made them too these men with broken heartsYou might also likeEmbed
