My Bucketâ€™s Got a Hole in It LyricsYea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer
Well I'm standin' on a corner - With a bucket in my hand
I'm waitin' for a woman - That ain't got no man
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer
Well, I went upon the mountain - I looked down in the sea
I seen the crabs and the fishes - Doin' the be-bop-bee
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer
Well, there ain't no use - of me workin' so hard
When I got a woman - in the boss man's yard
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beer
Well, me and my baby - we just bought a Ford
And now we sit together - on the running board
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
Yea! My bucket's got a hole in it
I can't buy no beerYou might also likeEmbed
