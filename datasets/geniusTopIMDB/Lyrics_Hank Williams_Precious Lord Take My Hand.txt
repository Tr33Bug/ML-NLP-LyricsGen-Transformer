Precious Lord, Take My Hand Lyrics[Chorus]
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on
Let me stand
I'm tired, I am weak I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

[Verse 1]
When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry
Hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home
[Verse 2]
When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet
Hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

[Chorus]
Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on
Let me stand
I am tired, I am weak, I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me homeYou might also like1Embed
