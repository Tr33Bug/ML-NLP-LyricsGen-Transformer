Ramblinâ€™ Man LyricsI can settle down and be doin' just fine
'Til I hear an old train rollin' down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack

I love you baby, but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see
Sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, He made a ramblin' man

I love to see the towns a-passin' by
And to ride these rails 'neath God's blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
Cause that's the life I believe, He meant for me

And when I'm gone and at my grave you stand
Just say God's called home your ramblin' manYou might also like3Embed
