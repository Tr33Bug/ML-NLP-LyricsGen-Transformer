Sally Goodin LyricsHad a piece of pie an' I had a piece of puddin'
An' I gave it all away just to see my Sally Goodin
Had a piece of pie an' I had a piece of puddin'
An' I gave it all away just to see my Sally Goodin
Well, I looked down the road an' I see my Sally comin'
An' I thought to my soul that I' d kill myself a-runnin'
Well, I looked down the road an' I see my Sally comin'
An' I thought to my soul that I'd kill myself a-runnin'

Love a 'tater pie an' I love an apple puddin'
An' I love a little gal that they call Sally Goodin
Love a 'tater pie an' I love an apple puddin'
An' I love a little gal that they call Sally Goodin
An' I dropped the 'tater pie an' I left the apple puddin'
But I went across the mountain to see my Sally Goodin
An' I dropped the 'tater pie an' I left the apple puddin'
But I went across the mountain to see my Sally Goodin
Sally is my dooxy an' Sally is my daisy
When Sally says she hates me I think I'm goin' crazy
Sally is my dooxy an' Sally is my daisy
When Sally says she hates me I think I'm goin' crazy
Little dog'll bark an' the big dog'll bite you
Little gal'll court you an' big gal'll fight you
Little dog'll bark an' the big dog'll bite you
Little gal'll court you an' big gal'll fight you

Rainin' an' a-pourin' an' the creek's runnin' muddy
An' I'm so drunk, Lord, I can't stand studdy
Rainin' an' a-pourin' an' the creek's runnin' muddy
An' I'm so drunk, Lord, I can't stand studdy
I'm goin' up the mountain an' marry little Sally
Raise corn on the hillside an' the devil in the valley
I'm goin' up the mountain an' marry little Sally
Raise corn on the hillside an' the devil in the valleyYou might also likeEmbed
