You Win Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
The news is out all over town
That you've been seen a-runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go, you win again

[Verse 2]
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do? You win again
[Verse 3]
I'm sorry for your victim now
'Cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain
And someday say you win again

[Verse 4]
You have no heart, you have no shame
You take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you, still you win againYou might also likeEmbed
