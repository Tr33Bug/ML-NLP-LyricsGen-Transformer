Afraid to Shoot Strangers Lyrics
Lying awake at night
I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear
Cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualize
The horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die
God, let us go now
And finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come
Thy shall be done on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves
The reasons to go
Should we live and let live?
Forget or forgive?

But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror, corruption must end
And we know deep down
There's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers


Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
