Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter Lyrics
Honey, it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
Unchain your back door
Invite me around
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Let her go, yeah

Honey, it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees, honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
You might also like
So pick up your foolish pride
No going back
Nowhere, no way, no place to hide
Let her go


Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
To the slaughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Gonna getcha!1Embed
