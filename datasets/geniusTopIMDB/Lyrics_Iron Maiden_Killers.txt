Killers Lyrics
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Ooh, look out!

You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me, ahahahahaha!

I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see, ahahaha!



My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Ohh yeah, I've done it again!

You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Ooh look out, I'm coming for you!
Hahahahahahaha!
