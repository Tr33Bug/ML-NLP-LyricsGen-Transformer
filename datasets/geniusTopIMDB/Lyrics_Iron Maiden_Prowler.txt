Prowler Lyrics
Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around


Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around

Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
You might also like
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around2Embed
