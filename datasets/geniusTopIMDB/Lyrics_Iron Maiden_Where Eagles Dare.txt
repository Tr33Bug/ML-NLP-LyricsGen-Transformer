Where Eagles Dare Lyrics

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky

The blizzard goes on, but still, they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare


They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable cars the only way in
It's really impossible to climb

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day

The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
You might also like
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare1Embed
