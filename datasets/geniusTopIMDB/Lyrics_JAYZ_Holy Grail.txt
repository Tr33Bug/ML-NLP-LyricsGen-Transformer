You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh
You might also like
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud (Uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh, uh, uh)
One day, you're here (Uh), one day, you're there
One day, you care (Uh), you're so unfair (Uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
I just can't crack your code (Uh)
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)
The next day, you're so cold (Uh)
One day, you're here, one day, you're there (Uh, uh)
One day, you care, you're so unfair (Uh, uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
(Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy grail)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't know why
