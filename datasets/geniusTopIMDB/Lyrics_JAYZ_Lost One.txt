Lost One Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh (It's not a diss song, it's just a real song)
Uh, uh (You feel me?)
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, "Okay, so? Make another Hov!"
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though, I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, "There I am"
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one
Lose one, let go to get one (One, one, one)
Get one, lose some to win some (One, one, one, one, you lost one)
Story of a champion (One, one, one)
Sorry, I'm a champion, you lost one (One, one, one, one, uh)
I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

Lose, one, let go to get one (One, one, one)
Get one, lose some to win some
One, one, one, oh yeah, she lost one
Story of a champion (One, one, one)
Sorry I'm a champion, you lost one (One, one, one)

My nephew died in the car I bought
So under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

Lose, one, let go to get one (One, one, one)
Get, one, lose some to win some
One, one, one, Colleek, I lost one
Story of a champion (One, one, one)
Colleek, you're a champion, I lost one (One, one, one)24Embed
