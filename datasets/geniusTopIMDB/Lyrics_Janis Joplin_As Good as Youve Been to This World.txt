As Good as Youâ€™ve Been to This World Lyrics
Live your loving life
Live it all the best you can
And if you pay no attention darling
To what you might ever hear from your man
I think you're just like a servant
And try to keep it all to yourself
Don't you know it makes the world go round
You got to go and honey share everywhere else
Come on, come on, come on!
As good as you've been to this world
So good I want to be right back to you
As good as you've been now
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
So good I want to be
As good as you've been now, say
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
As good as you've been, babe
So good I want to be here

It's no use in being faithful
I see you look at the sky
I know what's in it make you happy there
But it only make you cry
I think you got good intentions too
They don't manage to show through
Whatever you give to the world outside
I want to give it right back to you, yes I am!
Come on, come on, come on!

So you meet somebody on the street
You know you treat him mighty fine
Or you meet somebody on the street
And you give him a real hard time
It's gonna come on home baby
I said it's going to come right back home to you
I said it's going to visit you now
Yes it is, oh yes it is
You might also like
As good as you've been to this world
So good I want to be right back to you
As good as you've been now
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
So good I want to be
As good as you've been now, say
As good as you've been to this whole wide world
As good as you've been, babe
So good I want to be here

Good as you've been babe, hurrah!
Good as you've been babe, hey!
Good as you've been babe, hey!
Good as you've been babe
Because I'm just going to show you now
And I'm just going to make you want it now
Because I 'm just going to give you a thrill

Say, good as you been babe
Hurrah, good as you been babe
Come on, good as you been babe
I say, good as you been babe
Oh daddy, good as you been babe
My man, good as you been babe
All right, yeah hey1Embed
