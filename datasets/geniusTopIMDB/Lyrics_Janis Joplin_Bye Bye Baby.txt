Bye, Bye Baby Lyrics
Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
I got to be seeing you around
When I change my living standard and I move uptown
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
So long, my honey, so long
Too bad you had to drift away
Cause I could use some company
Right here on this road, on this road I am on today
I get the feeling I could chase you clean on in the ball
And wind up staying pull off, put down strung out and stalled
Honey, I have not got time to wait on you or to fetch your super ball
I got lots of things I have got to do
I know that you got things to do and places to be
I guess I will have to find the thing you placed on me
I may wind up in the street or sleep beneath a tree
Still I guess you know honey I have got to go

Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
I guess you know you are on your own
It seems you just got lost somewhere out in the world
And you left me here to face it all alone
You left me here to face it all alone
You left me here to face it all alone
Bye, bye-bye baby, baby bye-bye!You might also likeEmbed
