Now call on me, darling, and I will come to you
When you are in trouble and feel so sad
Well, call on me, darling, come on call on me, and I will help you
Yeah!

A man and a woman have each other, baby
To find their way in this world
I need you, darling, like the fish needs the sea
Do not take your sweet, your sweet love from me
Baby, when you are down and feel so blue
Well, no, you will not drown, darling, I will be there too
You are not alone, I am there too
Whatever your troubles, honey, I do not care


Please! So baby, when times are bad
