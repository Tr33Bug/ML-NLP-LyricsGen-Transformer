Câ€™mon Baby Let The Good Times Roll Lyrics
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on baby you're the best there is
Roll all night long

Come on baby, let's close the door
Come on baby, let's ride some more
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long
I feel so good when you're home
Come on baby, let's ride some more
Come on baby, rock me all night long!








Roll all night long
Roll all night longYou might also like1Embed
