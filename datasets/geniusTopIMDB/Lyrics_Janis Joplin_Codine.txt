Codine LyricsOn the day I was born the Grim Reaper smiled
He said I'll get you yet now you demonized child
But I's younger than all my brothers
You know it's all that's left of mine
Honey but I caught 'em
Yeah I passed 'em, hon I left 'em, left 'em with some Co-dine
And it's real, lord it's real yeah, one more time
Now I seem to recall when I's a young girl
How my joys and my happiness you know all seemed to whirl
But then somethings, honey sometimes, somehow it seems
Oh codine became so liked, it took my dreams
Hon and it's real, lord it's real yeah, one more time
It's the reason I breath honey, it's the reason I walk
It's the reason I sleep and the reason I talk
Yeah but soon my devotion will all be repaid
For codine will kill me honey, that's the bargin that we've made
And it's real, lord it's real yeah, one more time
And after I'm gone and this sad race is run
Guess I'll go down to hell where my life was begun
But there'll be somebody with me child that won't leave me alone
Oh codine'll be waitin' to punish my role
Hon it's real, lord it's real, one more time
Yeah and after I'm gone and the mornin' sets in
Don't you morn what I was girl nor'n what might have been
Morn my sad heart, honey my tear filled eyes
Morn the codeine that I need, that I crave, and I despise
Hon it's real, lord it's real, one more time
Yeah it's real, lord it's real, one more timeYou might also like1Embed
