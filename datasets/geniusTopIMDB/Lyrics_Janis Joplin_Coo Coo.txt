Coo Coo Lyrics
Oh, the cuckoo, she is a pretty bird, and she warbles when she flies
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July

Said Jack diamonds, well Jack diamonds, oh I know you of old
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold
All of my gold, all of my gold

Well, Jack diamonds, oh Jack diamonds, oh I know you of old
Honey, you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold
Said the cuckoo, she is a cruel bird, and she warbles when she flies
And every time that she passes, my true love says good-bye
Well, says good-bye, well says good-bye
Ooh, oohYou might also likeEmbed
