Easy Rider Lyrics
Hey mama, mama, come a look at sister
She's standing on the levee trying to do that twist

But easy rider do not you deny my name
Oh no, oh no

Well, I got a girl with a diamond ring
I will tell you, boys, she knows how to shake that thing

Well, I got a horse and he lives in a tree
He watches Huckleberry Hound on his TV


I would buy you a plastic suit
And I would even buy you some cardboard fruit


Yeah, easy rider, do you deny my name, pretty baby doll You might also likeEmbed
