Get It While You Can Lyrics
In this world, if you read the papers, Lord
You know everybody's fighting on with each other
You got no one you can count on, baby
Not even your own brother

So if someone comes along
He's going to give you some love and affection
I'd say get it while you can, yeah
Honey, get it while you can, yeah
Hey, hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love, no, no
Don't you know when you're loving anybody, baby
You're taking a gamble on a little sorrow
But then who cares, baby
'Cause we may not be here tomorrow, no

And if anybody should come along
He gonna give you any love and affection
I'd say get it while you can, yeah
Hey, hey, get it while you can
Hey, hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love, no, no
No no no no no


Oh, get it while you can, yeah
Honey, get it when you're gonna wanna need it dear, yeah yeah
Hey hey, get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love
No no no, no no no no, get it while you can, you
I said hold on to somebody when you get a little lonely, dear

Hey hey, hold on to that man's heart
Yeah, get it, want it, hold it, need it
Get it, want it, need it, hold it
Get it while you can, yeah
Honey get it while you can, baby, yeah
Hey hey, get it while you canYou might also likeEmbed
