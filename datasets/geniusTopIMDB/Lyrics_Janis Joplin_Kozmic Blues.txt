Kozmic Blues Lyrics
Time keeps moving on
Friends they turn away
I keep moving' on
But I never found out why
I keep pushing so hard the dream
I keep trying' to make it right
Through another lonely day, whoa a
Dawn has come at last
Twenty-five years, honey just in one night, oh yeah
Well, I'm twenty-five years older now
So I know we can't be right
And I'm no better, baby
And I can't help you no more
Than I did when just a girl
Aww, but it don't make no difference, baby, no, no
And I know that I could always try
It don't make no difference, baby, yeah
I better hold it now, I better need it, yeah
I better use it until the day I die, whoa

Don't expect any answers, dear
For I know that they don't come with age, no, no
Well, I'm never going to love you any better, babe
And I'm never going to love you right
So you'd better take it now, right now

Aww, but it don't make no difference, babe
And I know that I could always try
There's a fire inside of everyone of us
You better need it now, I get to hold it, yeah
I better use it until the day I die

Don't make no difference, babe, no, no, no
And it never ever will, hey
I want to talk about a little bit of loving, yeah
I get to hold it, baby
I'm going to need it now
I'm going to use it, say, aah
You might also likeDon't make no difference, babe, yeah
Ah honey, I'd hate to be the one
I said you're going to live your life
And you're going to love your life
Or babe, someday you're going to have to cry
Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed
Ah, baby, yes indeed
I said you, you're always going to hurt me
I said you're always going to let me down
I said everywhere, every day, every day
And every way, every way
Ah honey won't you hold on to what's going to move
I said it's going to disappear when you turn your back
I said you know it isn't going to be there
When you want to reach out and grab on

Whoa babe
Whoa babe
Whoa babe
Oh but keep trucking on
Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
