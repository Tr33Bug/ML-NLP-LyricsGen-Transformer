Light Is Faster Than Sound Lyrics
Light is faster than sound
My head to the ground
Mind going round
Faster than sound

What goes up must go down
World goes around
Sun shines around
Faster than sound
Suddenly I see your face
Faster than sound
Through the emptiness of space
Faster than sound
You're turning my mind all around
Faster than sound
Because life is faster than sound
Faster than sound
Faster than sound
