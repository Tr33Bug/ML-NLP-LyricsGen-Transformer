Little Girl Blue Lyrics
Sit there, hmm, count your fingers
What else, what else is there to do?
Oh and I know how you feel
I know you feel that you're through
Oh, wah wah ah, sit there, hmm, count
Ah, count your little fingers
My unhappy oh little girl, little girl blue, yeah

Oh sit there, oh count those raindrops
Oh, feel them falling down, oh honey all around you
Honey don't you know it's time
I feel it's time
Somebody told you because you got to know
That all you ever going to have to count on
Or going to want to lean on
It's going to feel just like those raindrops do
When they're falling down, honey, all around you
Oh, I know you're unhappy
Oh sit there
Oh go on, go on and count your fingers
I know what else, what else
Honey you've got to do
And I know how you feel
And I know you ain't got no reason to go on
And I know that you feel you must be through
Oh honey go on and sit right back down
I want you to count oh count your fingers
Ah my unhappy, my unlucky, and my little poor girl blue
I know you're unhappy
Oh ah hon' I know
Baby I know just how you feelYou might also like1Embed
