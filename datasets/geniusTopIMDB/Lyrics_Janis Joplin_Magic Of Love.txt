Magic Of Love Lyrics
Ooh! Hey, hey, now!

Alright
You went away, had your chance to say
"I love you and I need you baby"
Yeah, but even if
Honey, I told you daddy now
You wouldn't believe me anyway, no, no, no
Maybe you will now
I've changed a lot somehow
Let me do what I say
Come back and believe my love
Please! Now, come back and believe my love
Come back, and believe the magic of love

Oh, I want the light without the darkness
I want the sky without the sun, yeah!
When do the stars and the moon reach out?
When they see me alone without my loved one, yeah
Oh, now baby, don't you hear me
Won't you hear me I got to, got to, got to tell you
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Honey, I just got to tell you now
Honey, I want to tell you that I want you to dig it
Now if you believe in magic
Don't be afraid, afraid to use it, baby
No, no, no, come on home
Dressed in the mystic silk
Or wearing rich rags and waste
Darling, please
Come on back to me
I know we can be
Part of a magic race
