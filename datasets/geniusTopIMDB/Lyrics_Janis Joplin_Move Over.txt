Move Over LyricsYou say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over
You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be
I'm not quite ready for walking, no no no no
I'm not quite ready for walking
And what are you going to do with your life
Life all just dangling?
Oh yeah, make up your mind, honey
You're playing with me, hey hey hey
Make up your mind, darling
You're playing with me, come on now!
Now either be my loving man
I said let me honey, let me be, yeah!
You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over
You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please don't you do it to me babe, no!
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be
You might also likeI said won't you, won't you let me be?
Honey, you're teasing me
Yeah, you're playing with my heart, dear
I believe you're toying with my affections, honey
I can't take it no more baby
And furthermore, I don't intend to
I'm just tired of hanging from the end of a string, honey
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honey4Embed
