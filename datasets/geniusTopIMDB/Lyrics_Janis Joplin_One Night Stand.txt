One Night Stand Lyrics
When I'm on the road playing in a town without a name
And I'm feeling low and everybody looks the same
Well, you catch my eye, and then you come on strong and try to make your play
Just because we loved tonight, please don't you think it's going to stay that way

Don't you know that you're nothing more than a one night stand
Tomorrow I'll be on my way, and you can catch me if you can
Honey, take me by the hand and play that game again, yeah
Everywhere I go, the people wanna make some time with me
That's okay, if the next day I can be free
Well, it's feeling good and you're the one I'm loving tonight
Well, don't you go and spoil it, babe, by trying to get yourself all uptight




Don't you know that you're nothing more than a one night stand
Lord, Lord!You might also likeEmbed
