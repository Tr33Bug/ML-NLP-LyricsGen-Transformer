To Love Somebody Lyrics
There's a light, certain kind of light
Never ever, never shone on me, no, no
Honey, I want, I want my whole life
To be lived with you, babe
That's what I want oh, was to be
Living and loving you
There's a way, oh everybody say
You can do anything, every thing yeah
But what good, what good
Honey, what good could it ever bring
Because I haven't got you with my love
And I can't find you babe, no I can't

You don't know, you don't know what it's like
No you don't, honey no you don't know
You don't know what it's like
To love anybody
Oh honey, I want to talk about love
And trying to hold somebody
The way I love you babe
And I've been loving you babe

In my brain, oh I can see your face again
I know my frame of mind, yeah
But nobody, nobody has to ever be so blind
Honey, like I did, I know I was blind
Honey, I tell you that I was, I was very, very blind
Oh but I'm just a girl
Can't you just take a look at me and tell
Tell that I live, honey I live and I breathe for you
Don't you know I do!
You might also like
But what good, what good
Honey, what good could it ever bring
Because I haven't got you with my love
And I can't find you babe, no I can't

You don't know, you don't know what it's like
No you don't, honey no you don't know
You don't know what it's like
To love anybody
Oh honey, I want to talk about love
And trying to hold somebody
The way I love you babe
And I've been loving you babe

Oh, I know that there's a way
Because everybody came to me one time and said
"Honey, you can do anything
Every little thing, and I think I can
Oh, but what good, what good
Honey, what awfully good can it ever, ever bring
Because I can't find you with my love
And I can't find you babe, oh anywhere
