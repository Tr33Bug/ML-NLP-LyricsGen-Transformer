Try (Just a Little Bit Harder) Lyrics
Try, try, try just a little bit harder
So I can love, love, love him, I tell myself
Well, I'm going to try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I won't lose, lose, lose him to nobody else
Hey! Well, I don't care how long it's going to take you now
But if it's a dream I don't want, no, I don't really want it
If it's a dream I don't want nobody to wake me
Yeah, I'm going to try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I can give, give, give, give him every bit of my soul
Yeah, I'm going to try yeah, just a little bit harder
So I can show, show, show him love with no control
Hey! I've waited so long for someone so fine
I'm not going to lose my chance, no I don't want to lose it
I'm not going to lose my chance to make you mine, all mine
All right, get it! Yeah
Try yeah, try yeah, hey, hey, hey, try yeah
Oh try whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh anybody, oh anybody, oh anybody
Try oh yeah (just a little bit harder)
Whoa! I've got to try some more
I said try yeah, aw, I said try
I said try, try, try, try, try, try
Oh try, oh yeah, try, oh yeah!

Hey hey, I've got to talk to my man now
You know I, I've got to feel for my man now
I said I, I've got to work for my man now
You know I, I've got to hurt for my man now
I think every day for my man now
You know it, every way for my man now
I say try, try yeah, oh try yeah
Hey hey hey, try yeah-hey, oh, tryYou might also like4Embed
