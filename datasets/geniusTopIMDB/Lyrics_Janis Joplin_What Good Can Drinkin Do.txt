What Good Can Drinkinâ€™ Do Lyrics
What good can drinking do, what good can drinking do?
Lord, I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue

There's a glass on the table, they say it's going to ease all my pain 
But I drink it down, and the next day I feel the same
Give me whiskey, give me bourbon, give me gin 
Because it doesn't matter what I'm drinking, Lord
As long as it drowns this sorrow I'm in
I start drinking Friday, I start drinking Friday night 
But then I wake up on Sunday, child, there's nothing that's right
My man he left me, child, he left me here 
Lord, I'm feeling lowdown, just give me another glass of beer
