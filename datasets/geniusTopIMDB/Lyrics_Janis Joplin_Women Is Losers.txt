Women Is Losers Lyrics
Women is losers
Women is losers, oh
Say honey women is losers
Well, I know you must try, Lord
And everywhere
Men almost seem to end up on top

Oh, if they told you they want you
Say come around by your door
Whoa I say now, if they do not desert you
They'll leave you and never be here for more
Oh yeah!

They wear a nice shiny armor
Until there is a dragon for to slay
Any day now
Course with men beginning to pay them
Then they'll turn and run away, oh!
