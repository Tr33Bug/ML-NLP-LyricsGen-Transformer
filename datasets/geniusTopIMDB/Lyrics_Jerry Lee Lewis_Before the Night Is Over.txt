Before the Night Is Over LyricsI can tell by the way you're a little bit lonesome baby, just like Jerry Lee
It's just like someone that you're needing to forget
Honey, that's the same thing with me I've been wanderin' baby why don't we?
Just make believe it ain't the first time we have met
And before the night is over you're gonna be in love
I bet you by the mornin', I'll be the only one that you'll be thinkin' of
So we will, will come together as close as fingers in a glove
And before the night is over you gonna be in love
Woooo!
Play a little piano I hear!
Yeah!
Honey I can tell, Jerry Lee can tell, somebody might put that lady there right through to hell
And she can use a little tenderness these things I know
O if you feel that it's wrong Lord I could be comin' on a little bit too strong
Just let me know I'll pack my jump I just might go
But before the night is over, you gonna be in love
I bet you by the mornin', I'll be the only one that you'll be thinkin' of
So we will come together as close as fingers in a glove
And before the night is over
I said before the night is over
Hey girl before the night is over you gonna be in love
Gonna be in love! Whoa!You might also likeEmbed
