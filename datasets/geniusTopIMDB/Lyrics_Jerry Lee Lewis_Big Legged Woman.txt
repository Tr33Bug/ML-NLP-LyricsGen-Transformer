Big Legged Woman LyricsBig legged woman
Keep your dresses down
You've got something baby
That'll make a bulldog hug a hound
Big legged mama
Haha
Keep your dresses down
I swear honey
You got somethin' up under there
Mmmmmmm, that makes me wanna
Lay it down a ha ha ha
Little break now
She rolls her belly
Like she rolls her biscuit dough
She lay down so easy
Till she got to have some more
Oh big legged mama
Ooooh, keep your dresses down
Don't stop me now mama
You've got somethin' baby
Mmm, make a fool dog a hound
Well, yeah
Oooh, look who's callin', lookit here
Well, let me tell ya tell ya tell ya somethin'
What I'm talking' about
I bet my bottom dollar
There ain't a cherry in this house
Oh, big legged mama
Keep your dresses down
'Cause when I start drillin on ya baby
You're gonna lose your nightgown
It's a hit!You might also likeEmbed
