Bonnie b. LyricsWell, Bonnie-Bonnie B, she's like a little queen bee
She stands out among the others, you see
She makes me happy, makes me feel so good
I would marry Bonnie B if I could
But we're too young, got a long time to wait
Bonnie baby, that don't mean hesitate
'Bout lovin' me
So, kiss me Bonnie-Bonnie B
Bonnie B, Bonnie-Bonnie-Bonnie B
Bonnie-Bonnie B, she's the pride of our school
When she walks down the hall
Well, all the kids all drool
With her long blond hair and cherry pink lips
Turned up nose that makes a cat wanna flip
Flip over Bonnie-Bonnie B
Bonnie B, Bonnie-Bonnie-Bonnie B
Well, I told Bonnie B to take a ride with me
Told her I'd show her all she could see
She don't know, but it'll be too dark
But that lover's lane is where I plan to park
And I'm gonna ask her if I can kiss her then
And if I can, I'm gonna do it again
More tenderly, when I kiss my Bonnie-Bonnie B
Bonnie B, Bonnie-Bonnie-Bonnie B
Bonnie-Bonnie B, she's the pride of our school
When she walks down the hall
Well, all the kids all drool
With her long blond hair and cherry pink lips
And turned up nose that makes a cat wanna flip
Flip over Bonnie-Bonnie B
Bonnie B, Bonnie-Bonnie-Bonnie BYou might also likeEmbed
