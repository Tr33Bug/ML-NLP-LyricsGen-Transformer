Breathless LyricsHey girl, if you're gonna love me, honey, please don't tease
If I can hold you, baby, let me squeeze
With my heart going round and round
And my love comes a-tumblin' down
You, you leave me (aaah)
Breathless-ah!
Come on and shake all over, I think you know why
They call it love, it couldn't be no lie
Cause when you call my name, uh, I a-burn like a wooden flame
You, leave me (aah)
It's breathless-ah!
Ooh baby, just a little bit crazy
Honey you're much too much, girl I just can't love you enough
Oh, it's alright to hold me tight, but for you to love me then love me right
Oh come on baby now don't be shy this love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet or snow, I'm gonna get you baby wherever you go
You, leave me (aah)
Breathless-ah!
(Rock n' roll, brother!)
Well, ooh baby, it's crazy
Honey, you're much too much, thank god girl I can't love you enough
It's alright to hold me tight, but for you to love me then love me right
C'mon baby, don't be shy, this love was meant for you and I
A-wind, rain, sleet or snow, honey's gonna get you wherever you go
You, you leave me (aaah)
Breathless-ah!You might also likeEmbed
