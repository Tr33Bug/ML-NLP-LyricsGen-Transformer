Cold, Cold Heart LyricsI've tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from the lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart?
Another love before my time had made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying dear for things he really didn't do
In anger, unkind words I said had make those teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart?
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know I need, I want your love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smart?
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart?You might also likeEmbed
