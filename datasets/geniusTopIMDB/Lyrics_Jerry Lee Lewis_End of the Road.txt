End of the Road LyricsWell the way is dark the night is long
I don't care if I never get home
I'm waitin' at the end of the road
Well the stars may not shine and neither the moon
What the heck we don't want no moon
I'm waitin' yeah at the end of the road
You can jump in my Ford and you can give it a gas
Pull out the throttle don't give me no sass
Take your foot slap it on the floor
When we get together we're gonna shake a little more
Oh the way is dark the night is long I don't care if I never get home
I'm waitin' uh huh at the end of the road yeah
Oh you can jump in my Ford...
Lord I'm waitin' waitin' waitin' at the end of the roadYou might also likeEmbed
