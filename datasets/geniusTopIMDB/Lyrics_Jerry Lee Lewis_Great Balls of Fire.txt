Great Balls of Fire Lyrics
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

I laughed at love 'coz I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me, honey
I've changed my mind
This love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Kiss me, baby
Mmmmh, it feels good
Hold me, baby
Well, I'm off to love you like a lover should
Oh! You're fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby
You drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!


Well, kiss me, baby
Mmmmh, it feels good
Hold me, baby
Well, I'm off to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
Real nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby
You're driving me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!You might also like2Embed
