Hello Josephine LyricsHello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler "Woo woo woo"
I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella ev'ry time it rained
You used to cry so much it was a crying shame
Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo"
You used to live over yonder by the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk I used to tote you on my back
Now you gotta make believe it was a thrill at that
Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo"You might also likeEmbed
