I’m Longing for Home LyricsI'm just a pilgrim and a stranger
With this unfriendly world I now roam
Seeking He who has promised salvation
And He who has promised a home
And through the dark veil, I wonder
And I know that I have surely gone astray
Through trouble, through trial, through darkness
I'll see blessed Jesus, someday
And I'm longing for home
Though the sun's going down
I long to go where
Sweet rest can be found
Lord, I'm just about through
With this old house of clay
I said I long to see, Jesus
Way up yonder in glory, someday
Oh, Jerry's longing for home
Though the sun's going down
I said I long to go where
Sweet rest may be found, hallelujah!
Lord, I'm just about through, hallelujah
With this old house of clay
I said I long to see my, Jesus
Whoa Lord, way up in a-glory someday
Yeah, I'm gonna sing it one more time for ya, now
Lord, I'm longing for home
Though the sun is goin' down
Let it go, Hallelujah, I'm ready to go!
I long to go where
Just get me outta this old world, Lord
Sweet rest can be found
Yes, I'm just about through
With this old house of clay
I long to see, Jesus
In glory someday-eeeYou might also likeEmbed
