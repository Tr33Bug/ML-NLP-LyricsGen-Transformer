Jambalaya LyricsGoodbye Joe, me gotta go, down the bayou
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh, my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a file gumbo
Yeah tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have a little fun on the bayou
Thibodeaux, fontainbleau, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh, my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have a little fun on the bayou
Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a file gumbo
Well, tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio
Pick guitar, gonna fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayouYou might also likeEmbed
