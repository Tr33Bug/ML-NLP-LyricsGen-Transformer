Johnny B. Goode LyricsYeah!
Oh, Johnny B. Goode!
Give it to me!
He's down in Lousiana, close to New Orleans
'Back up in the woods among the evergreens
'Stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
'Lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
He played the guitar like the a-ringin' of a bell
Oh go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Oh-oh, Johnny B. Goode
Yeah, used to carry guitar in a gunny sack
Sittin' 'neath the trees by the railroad track
Y'old engineer would blow it on a lovely day
Strummin' through the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin' by they would stop and say
Oh, that little country boy could play
Go, go
Go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Oh, Johnny B. Goode

Well his mama told him a-someday, son, you gonna be a man
A-say you're gonna be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people coming from miles around
T'hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will in light
"Johnny B. Goode, tonight"
