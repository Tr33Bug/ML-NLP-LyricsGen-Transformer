Lewis Boogie LyricsMy name is Jerry Lee Lewis, come from Louisiana
I'm gonna do you a little boogie on this here piano
Doing mighty fine, I'm gonna make you shake it
I'll make you do it, and make you do it, until you break it
It's called the Lewis boogie, in the Lewis way
Lord, I do my little boogie-woogie every day
Well, down in New Orleans, the land of dreams
The best doggone place, son, you have ever seen
The cats go wild, do a boogie that's hot
My boogie-woogie makes you want to stop and do the bop
It's called the Lewis boogie, in the Lewis way
Lord, I do my little boogie-woogie every day
Oh, oh boy!
Well, now let's cruise on down to old Memphis town
That's where that Presley boy said, "you ain't nothing but a hound"
But now you take my boogie, it keeps you in the groove
Then your sacroiliac begins to shiver and a move
It's called the Lewis boogie, in the Lewis way
Lord, I do my little boogie-woogie every day
Oh, boogie-woogie
When your hips start rockin'
Honey, and your knees start knockin'
Lewis boogie, Lewis way
Lord, I do my little boogie-woogie every dayYou might also likeEmbed
