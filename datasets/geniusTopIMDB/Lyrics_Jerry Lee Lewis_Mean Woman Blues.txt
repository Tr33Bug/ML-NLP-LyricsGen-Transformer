Mean Woman Blues LyricsI got a woman mean as she can be
Yeah, I got a woman mean as she can be
Sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
Well, I ain't braggin', it's understood
Everything I do, well, I sure do it good
I got a woman mean as she can be
Oh, sometimes I think she's almost mean as me, yeah
Yeah, she's got ruby lips, shapely hips
Boy, she'd makes ol' Jerry flip
I got a woman mean as she can be
Oh, sometimes I think she's almost mean as me, yeah
Well, I like a little coffee, like a little tea
Jerry, Jerry, it's the thing for me
I got a woman mean as she can be
Oh, sometimes I think she's almost mean as me
Oh, aha, aha, aha ha, ooh aha
Hmm, uhm, uhm
Easy now, ahh ooh, brrr
Yeah, and let's go one time
Hey, I got a woman mean as she can be
Yeah, got a little woman as mean as she can be
Well, sometimes I think she's almost mean as meYou might also likeEmbed
