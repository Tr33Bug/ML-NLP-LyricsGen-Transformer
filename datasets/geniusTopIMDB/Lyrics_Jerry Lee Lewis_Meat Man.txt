Meat Man LyricsOh, they call me the meat man
Ya oughta see me eat, m'am
Hear I'm the meat man, baby
Ya oughta see me eat, m'am
I got jaws like a bear trap
Teeth like a razor
Got a Maytag tongue
With a sensitive taste
A born in Texas
A land of beef
Never cared much for greens
Ya' oughta heard I like meat
I'm the meat man
Woo, oughta see me eat, now
Whoa, I'm the meat man, baby
Ya oughta see me eat, now
I been down to Macon, Georgia
I ate the furs off a Georgia peach
Plucked me a chicken in Memphis
Mama, I still got feathers in my teeth
Ate a pound of pork Huntsville, Alabama
From a fine Alabama hog
I went to Dallas, Texas
Got no love, my baby left me
Fed the bone to a Louisiana dog
Hear me talkin'
A meat man
Woo, meat man!
Yeah, I'm a meat man, baby
Ya oughta see me eat, m'am
'That's right!'
'Think about it, baby!'
You might also likeYea-ea-eah, it don't make me no difference
Just as long as it's good meat!
I ain't got no preference
If it's dog or rat, I eat
It don't a-have to be U.S. Governmental grade
With stamp a-no Grade 'A' seal
As long as it lean, it full-a protein
I'm gonna damn sho' get my fill
Oh well, they call me the
Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat
Meat, meat, meat, meat, man
Hey!
Meat man! Hoo!Embed
