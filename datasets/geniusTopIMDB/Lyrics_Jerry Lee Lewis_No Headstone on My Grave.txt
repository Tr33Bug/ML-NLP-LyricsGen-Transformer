No Headstone on My Grave LyricsDon't put no headstone on my grave
All my life I've been a slave
Want the whole wide world to know
That I'm the man that loved you so
Mama, mama, don't you cry
I'm gonna meet you in the by and by, in the sweet by and by
Tell papa I'm comin' home, comin' on home
God, it can't be very long
Don't put no headstone on my grave
All my life I've been a slave
Want the whole wide world to know
That I'm the stud that loved you so
M,m,m,m,m,m mama don't you cry
Lord, I'm gonna meet you in the by and by, in the sweet by and by
Tell papa I'm coming home
Oh God, it can't be very long
Don't put no headstone on my grave
Whoooh! All my life I've been a slave, motherhumpin' slave
And you know something?
I want the world to know
That I'm the stud that loved that woman so
Mama, mama don't you cry, mama, don't cry
