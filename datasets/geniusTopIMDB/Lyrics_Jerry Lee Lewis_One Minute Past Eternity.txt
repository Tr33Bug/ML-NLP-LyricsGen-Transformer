One Minute Past Eternity LyricsWhen will my arms grow cold
When will your kiss grow old
When will I want to be free
Exactly one minute past eternity
When will I make you blue
Cheat and run around on you
Throw away the love you've given me
Exactly one minute past eternity
Eternity is forever
So darling, have no fear
My love for you will last and last
For million, million years
When will I say goodbye
Break your heart and make you cry
Tell you to forget about me
Exactly one minute past eternity
Eternity is forever
So darling, have no fear
My love for you will last and last
For million, million years
When will I say goodbye
Break your heart and make you cry
Tell you to forget about me
Exactly one minute past eternity
Exactly one minute past eternityYou might also likeEmbed
