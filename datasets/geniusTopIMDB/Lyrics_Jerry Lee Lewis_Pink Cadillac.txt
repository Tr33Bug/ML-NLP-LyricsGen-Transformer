Pink Cadillac LyricsYou may think I'm foolish for the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you when you get on my nerves like you do
Well, baby, you know you bug me, ain't no secret 'bout that
Well, come on over here and hug me, baby, I'll show you where it's at
Well, honey, it ain't your money, baby, I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Way back in the Bible, temptation always comes along
There's always somebody tempting somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well, they tempt you, man, with silver, and they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple but, man, I ain't going for that
I'm going for the pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what it feels like in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Yeah, some folks say it's a little too big and uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old, it goes just a little too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man, there's only one thing and there's one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it, we can park it out in back
Have a party in your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back of your pink Cadillac
