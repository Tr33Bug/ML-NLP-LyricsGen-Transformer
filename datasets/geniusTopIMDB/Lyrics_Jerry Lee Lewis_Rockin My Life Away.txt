Rockinâ€™ My Life Away Lyrics1425 to 1498
I've thrown a rock 'n' roll party on my last birthday
But it's good, a-rockin' my life away
I've been movin' and-a groovin' and-a gettin' it both night and day
I got a gal called Nelly, she's-a chilli pepper hot
She knows how to roll, The Killer knows how to rock
And I'm rockin' (rock), rockin' my life away
I've been-a rockin' and-a rollin' and-a movin' both night and day
Well the streamline, fleet line, military brat
She knows the general's daughter, but the killer's top prize
I'm rockin' (rock), rockin' my life away
I'm been movin' and movin', and gettin' it both night and day
Watch me now
Here, come on baby, you know what I mean
I likes the way that you shake that thing
'Cause I'm rockin' (rock), rockin' my life away
I'm been gettin' gettin' gettin' gettin' it goin' night and day
Hit a jam!
You better get up, all, and rock up, oh, but don't do it too slow
'Cause I'm a man, message my mother, I've been gettin' into holes
And I'm rockin', rockin' my life away
I like-a rock n' roll and I'm darn sure here to stay
Yeah!
Rockin' my life away
My name is Jerry Lee Lewis and I'm darn sure here to stay
Let's get it!
Rock (rock)
Rock n' roll
Rock (rock)
Rock n' roll
Rock (rock)
Oh, (rock n' roll) Rock n' roll (rock, rock n' roll)
