That Lucky Old Sun LyricsUp in the morning, out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat 'till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day
Good Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes?
Send down that cloud with the silver lining
Take me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun with nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day
Good Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes?
Send down that cloud with the silver lining
Take me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
And wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun with nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven, just rolling 'round your Heaven
My God, let me roll 'round Heaven all dayYou might also likeEmbed
