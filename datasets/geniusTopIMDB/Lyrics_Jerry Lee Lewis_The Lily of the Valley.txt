The Lily of the Valley LyricsI have found a friend in Jesus He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
The lily of the valley and in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
In sorrow He's my comfort in trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley He's the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows borne
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower
I have all for Him forsaken and all my idols torn
From my heart and now I know He'll keep me by His power
Though all the world forsake me and old Satan he tempts me sore
Through Jesus I shall safely reach that goal
He's the lily of the valley He's the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He will never never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
It's a wall of fire about me but I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul is gonna fill
Then I'll go sweeping up to Glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
He's the lily of the valley He's the bright and morning star
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soulYou might also likeEmbed
