Wild One LyricsWell, I'm just out of school
I'm real real cool
I got the jump, got the jive
Got the message, I'm alive
I'm a wild, I'm wild one
Ooh, yeah I'm a wild one
I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
I'm gonna keep a-movin', baby
Don't you cramp my style, I'm a real wild child
Come on, baby, shake all night long
Shake until the meat come off of the bone
'Cause I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one
I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
Gonna keep a-movin', baby
Don't you cramp my style, I'm real wild child
Yeah!
Well, I gonna pick you up in my '88
Get ready, sugar, now don't be late
We're gonna move it all night long
Until a whole lotta shakin' goin' be on
I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one
I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
I'm gonna keep a-movin', baby
Don't you cramp my style, I'm a real wild child
Whoa!
Well, I really get to movin' when the sun goes down
Oh, after dark, I can get around
Gonna move on, I'll make every hop
When we start to boppin', I sure can't stop
I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one
I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
I'm gonna keep a-movin', baby
Don't you cramp my style, I'm a real wild child
I'm a real wild child
I'm a real wild child
I'm a real wild child
