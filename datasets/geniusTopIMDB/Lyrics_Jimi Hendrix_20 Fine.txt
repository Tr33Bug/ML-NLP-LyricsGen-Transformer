$20 Fine Lyrics[Verse 1]
One more day feelin' this way
Walkin' through it anyway
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
Can't seem to believe the truth that's mine

[Chorus]
But I know my time is comin'
Everything we want is just around the corner, honey
Carry it all
Witness a world that's whirlin'
Take some time and ﬁnd out who we are
Oh, yes, who we are
[Verse 2]
One more dream, one more scheme
Life just isn't what it seems
One more day, heavy dues to pay
Hope someone'll give it back to me someday

[Chorus]
And I know my time is comin'
Everything we want is just around the corner, honey
Carry it all
Witness a world that's whirlin'
Got to take some time and ﬁnd out who we are
Ah yeah, ﬁnd out
[Instrumental break 1:49-2:38]
[Verse 3]
One more time walkin' the line
Pay a twenty dollar line
Don't let the man get too out of hand
If he hits you in the head, you're gonna wish you ran

[Chorus]
And I know our time is comin‘
Everything we want is just around the corner
Carry it all
Witness a world that‘s whirlin‘
Got to take some time and ﬁnd out who we are

[Verse 4]
One more time walkin' the line
Pay a thirty dollar ﬁne
Hope that the man don't get out of hand
Punchin‘ the lip of truth at night

[Outro]
But I know our time is comin'
Everything we want is just around the corner, honey
Carry it allEmbed
