Astro Man Lyrics[Intro]
Here I come to save the day

[Verse 1]
A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face, and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from Heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
It said, "Get out there, man, and a-do your best"
Uh

[Chorus]
They call him Astro Man
And he is flying higher than
That old faggot superman
Ever could
[Verse 2]
Oh, they call him Cosmic Nut
And he's twice as dense as Donald duck
And he will try his best to screw you up
The rest of your mind

[Interlude]
Oh, look out, my guitars!

[Chorus]
Astro man
Flying across the sky
Ten times higher
Then that old faggot superman
Ever, ever could
Ever could

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
There he goes, there he goes
Where he stops? No one knows
There he goes, there he goes, uh

[Outro]
He is trying to, trying to blow out the rest of your mind
He's going to blow out the rest of your mind
Talking about looking for peace of mind
Astro man will leave it in pieces
Have you put our trouble behind him
Make you fly around in pieces
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind
He's going to blow out the rest of your mind
Wu-hu, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Blow out the rest of your mindYou might also like1Embed
