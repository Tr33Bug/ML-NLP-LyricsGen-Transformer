Belly Button Window Lyrics[Chorus]
Well, I'm up here in this womb
I'm looking all around
Well, I am looking out my belly button window
And I see a whole lot of frowns
And I am wondering if they don't want me around

[Verse]
What seems to be the fuss out there?
Just what seems to be the hang?
Because you know if you just do not want me this time around
Yeah, I will be glad to go back to spirit land
And even take a longer rest
Before I am coming down the chute again
Man, I sure remember the last time, baby
They were still hawking about me then
So if you don't want me now
Make up your mind, where or when
If you don't want me now
Give or take, you only got two hundred days
Because I ain't coming down this way too much more again

You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think you are just a little too late
So I'm coming down into this world, daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And I'm going to sit up in your bed, mama
And just grin right in your face
And then I'm going to eat up all your chocolates
And say, "I hope I'm not too late!"

So if there is any questions
Make up your mind
Because you better give or take
Questions in your mind
Give it or take
You only got two hundred days

[Chorus]
Well, I'm up here in this womb
Looking all around, sure is dark in here
I'm looking out my belly button window
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they want me aroundYou might also likeEmbed
