Bleeding Heart Lyrics
Have mercy, have mercy
Have mercy people, listen now
You know what it means to be left alone
Have mercy, people
Do you know what it means to be left alone?
No letter today
Not even a call on my telephone
Every, every morning
Every morning I hear the birds call my name
Every morning I hear the birds call my name
Oh little birds call me
Because my heart is so much in pain
Heaven

Have mercy
A little loving is all in the world I need
Have mercy, have mercy now
A little loving is all in the world I need
Misunderstanding and a no good woman
They both have caused my heart to bleedYou might also likeEmbed
