Catfish Blues Lyrics
Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in, Lord, the deep blue sea
I'd have all you pretty women
Fishing after me, fishing after me
Fishing after me, yeah

Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

When I went down, my girlfriends house
And I sat down, Lord, on her front step
And she said, "Come in now Jimi
My husband just now left, just now left"
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

Well there's two, two trains running
But there's not one, Lord, that's going my way
You know there's a one train running at midnight
Other ones leave just for a day
Leave just for a day

Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah
