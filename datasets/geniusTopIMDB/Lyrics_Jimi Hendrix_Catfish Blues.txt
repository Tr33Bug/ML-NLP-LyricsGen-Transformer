Catfish Blues Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in, Lord, the deep blue sea
I'd have all you pretty women
Fishing after me, fishing after me
Fishing after me, yeah

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 2]
When I went down, my girlfriends house
And I sat down, Lord, on her front step
And she said, "Come in now Jimi
My husband just now left, just now left"
[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

[Verse 3]
Well there's two, two trains running
But there's not one, Lord, that's going my way
You know there's a one train running at midnight
Other ones leave just for a day
Leave just for a day

[Refrain]
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah
