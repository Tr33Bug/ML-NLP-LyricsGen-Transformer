Changes - Live at Fillmore East 1/1/70  Lyrics
"Buddy Miles is going to do this thing he wrote
Called 'Them Changes'"

Well my mind is going through them changes
I feel just like I'm in the time
Every time you see me going some where
I feel like I'm going out of my mind, yeah
Oh, my baby she left me the other day
And we were having so much fun yeah, yeah
Oh, my baby she stepped out on me
And that's the reason why she had to part
It's alright yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo-hoo

Well my mind is going through them changes
I think I'm going out of my mind
Every time you see me going some where
I think I could commit a crime know
She had me running
She had me crying
She had me running
She had me, had me, had me crying
She had me running
She had me crying
She had me running
Had me crying

It's alright yeah, yeah
It's alright
What I say
It's alright
Ooo-hoo

Clap your hands

What I say
It's alright

It's alright yeah, yeah

What I say
