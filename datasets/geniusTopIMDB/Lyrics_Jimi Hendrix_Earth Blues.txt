Earth Blues Lyrics[Verse 1: Jimi Hendrix]
Well, I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land
Well, I taste tears and the precious years wasted
Saying Lord, please, send us a helping hand

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
On the mountain stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Got them earth blues today
[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
I hear the thunder of freedom's beating heart
Sirens clashing with black earth and rocking stone
I think you better love me now, darling, it just might be too late after a while
And tell our child to bury old daddy's broken clothes

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I see a beautiful woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Yes, and I feel her shining light on me
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord! Must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Help me, Lord, and keep her alright for me

[Bridge: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Help me, darling)
Help me, darling
(Help me, darling)
To keep the light
(Help me, darling)
Everything alright
(Help me, darling)
Keep shining bright
(Help me, darling)
Help me darling
(Help me, darling)
Help me darling
(Help me, darling)
Ooh!
(Help me, darling)
Got those earth blues today
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Oooh!
(Lord, Lord, Lord)

Yeah but, uh, sometimes my imagination grabs me by surprise
A queen of ebony in chains I visualize
And back on the moon, I see her portrait in a tomb
And these words are written, first woman from God's womb

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey! Stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
And I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Yeah!
I think I'll be alright with my baby now
Shake these earth blues away from me, baby1Embed
