Fire Lyrics[Intro]
Alright
Now dig this, baby

[Verse 1]
You don't care for me
I don't-a care about that
You got a new fool, ha!
I like it like that

[Pre-Chorus]
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire
[Chorus]
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Hey, let me stand next to your fire
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Whoa, let me stand, baby
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
Listen here, baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom ain't home, it ain't my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't get burned

[Pre-Chorus]
I have only one a-itchin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Yeah, let me stand, baby
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Oh, let me stand
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Ow!

You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day

[Pre-Chorus]
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Let me stand next to your fire, ha

[Chorus]
(Let me stand next to your fire)
Ow! A-let me stand
