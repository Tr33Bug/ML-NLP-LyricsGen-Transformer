Foxey Lady - Anthology Version Lyrics[Verse 1]
You know you're a cute little heartbreaker
Foxy
And you know you're a sweet little lovemaker
Foxy

I want to take you home, yeah
I won't do you no harm, no
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Ooh, foxy lady

Now I see you, heh, are down on the scene
Foxy
You make me want to get up and scream
Foxy
Ah, baby listen now

I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Foxy lady
Here I come

Yeah, I'm gonna take you home
I won't do you no harm, no
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Foxy lady
