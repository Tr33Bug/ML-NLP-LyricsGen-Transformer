Georgia Blues LyricsI was born in Georgia 27 years ago
Yes I was
I was born down in Georgia, people let me tell you, 27 years ago
Augusta Georgia, that’s what I’m talkin’ about
I’ve had heartaches and misery
And I ain’t got no place to go
Have you ever seen a man, with tears rolling down his face
Good God, all-mighty, you know what I’m talking about
Have you ever seen a man, with tears rolling down his face
You know what I’m talking about
They say that a man, a man ain’t supposed to cry
But somebody tell me what else can I do?
But my little girl has walked out on me
Mama, ooh mama mama
Can you hear your little boy calling your name
Yeah yeah
Ooh mama mama mama can you hear your little boy calling your name
The blues has got me, and I’m in so much misery and pain
Somebody, somebody listen to what I got to say
I need a little help, I need a little help right now
Lord I need I need a helping hand
Good God almighty
I said I need a little help right now, Lord I need a helping hand
My life, my life just ain’t no good
And I’m living in the world, without a helping hand
Somebody come on and help me out here
Come on, come on and help me out right now
So long, everybody
Lord I don’t see no reason to stay around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me say it again
I said so long, goodbye everybody
Lord I don’t see no reason to stay around
Well now, the little girl that I love has gone and left me
And all my friends, all my friends have put me down
All my friends have put me downYou might also likeEmbed
