Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my
Hear my train a comin'

Ayy ayy ayy yeah-eah

[Verse]
Well, I
Wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Take me, take me
Take me away
From this
Lonesome town

Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey

Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me in my eyes
Way down
Way down in my soul
Tears burnin' me way down in my heart
Yeah
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad you and me had to part
Had to part

Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
