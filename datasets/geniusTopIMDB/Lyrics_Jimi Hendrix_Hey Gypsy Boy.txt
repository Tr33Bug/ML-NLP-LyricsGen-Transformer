Hey Gypsy Boy Lyrics[Verse]
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you come from
From the land (of the) new rising sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to
I'm going to spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind too
Lord, may I come along
[Chorus]
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to
I'm going to spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind too
Lord, may I come along

[Chorus]
May I come along
May I come along
May I come alongYou might also likeEmbed
