In from the Storm Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well I, I just came back today
I just came back from the storm
Yeah

I said, I just came back, baby
I just came back from the storm
Yeah, from the storm

Well, I did not know it then
But I was suffering, suffering
For my love to keep me warm
[Chorus][x2]
It was so cold and lonely, yeah
The wind and crying blue rain
Were tearing me up

[Verse 2]
I want to thank you, my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
Thank you so much

It was a crying blue rain, the burning my eyes
The wind and lightning struck by suprise
It was you, my love, who brought me in
I love you so much
I'll never stray from you again
Hey

[Outro]
I just came back today
I just came back to get my baby on her way
Yeah, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
