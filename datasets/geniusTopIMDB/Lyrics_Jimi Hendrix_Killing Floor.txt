Killing Floor Lyrics[Verse 1]
I should have quit you
A long time ago
I should have quit you, baby
A long time ago

[Chorus]
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I don't follow, yeah
My first mind
If I don't fallow, pretty baby
My first mind
I would have been gone since my second time
Yeah
[Bridge]
Lord knows, right now
I should have been gone
Lord knows, I should have been gone

[Chorus]
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeah
But you got me messing around with you, baby
You got me crying on a killing floor, yeahYou might also like1Embed
