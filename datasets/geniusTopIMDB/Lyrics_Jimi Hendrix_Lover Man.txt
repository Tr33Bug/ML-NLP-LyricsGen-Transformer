Lover Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here he comes, baby
Here comes your lover man
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I'll sneak out your window, babe
I really gotta go as fast as I can
Reach down, baby
And get on my running shoes
Reach down, baby
And get on my running shoes
See your man coming
Babe, I've got no time to lose
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I wanna love you longer, baby
I wanna love you stronger, stronger
But I wanna love you all night longer
But that's your man, way over yonder now
