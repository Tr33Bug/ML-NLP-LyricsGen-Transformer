Machine Gun - Live at Fillmore East 1/1/70 [First Show] Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
Happy New Year, first of all
I hope we have about a million, or two million more of them
If we can get over this summer; hehehe
I'd like to dedicate this one to, uh
The draggy scene that's going on
All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York
Oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam
I'd like to do a thing called "Machine Gun"

[Refrain]
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
[Verse 1]
Evil man make me kill you
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

[Verse 2]
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
You know what I mean?
Hey, and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah, but you still blast me down, to the ground

[Verse 3]
The same way you shoot me down, baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey, machine gun

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After awhile your, your cheap talk won't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Because I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be going just the same
You might also like[Refrain]
Yeah, machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah, yeah, alright
Tearing my family apart
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no, no

[Outro]
Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright
(No bullets)
At least here, huh huh
(No guns, no bombs)
Huh huh
No nothing, just let's all live and live
You know instead of killing20Embed
