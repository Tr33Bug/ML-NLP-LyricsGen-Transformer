Machine Gun  Lyrics
Happy new year first of all. I hope we'll have million or two million more of them... if we can get over this summer, ha ha ha. I'd like to dedicate this one to the draggin' scene that's goin' on. All the soldiers that are fightin' in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York... Oh yes, and all the soldiers fightin' in Vietnam. I'd like to do a thing called "Machine Gun"

Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
(You know what I mean)
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground
The same way you shoot me down baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun
I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After a while your cheap talk don't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Cause I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be goin' just the same
Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart

Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Where he can't survive, no no

Yeah that's what we don't wanna hear any more, alright
No bullets
At least here, huh huh
No guns, no bombsYou might also likeEmbed
