Message to Love - Live at Fillmore East 1/1/70  Lyrics
"Jimi's gonna do a thing that he, he wrote called 'Message of Love'"

Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I send a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today
Well I am what I am, thank God
Some people just don't understand what I'm about
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool baby
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come on along with me
Don't mess with your man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
And then prove to the man
You're as strong as him
'Cause in the eyes of God
You're both chewin' it to him
You might also like
Everybody come alive
Everybody love all night
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my messageEmbed
