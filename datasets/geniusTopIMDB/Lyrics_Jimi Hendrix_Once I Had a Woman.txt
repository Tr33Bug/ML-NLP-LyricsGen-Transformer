Once I Had a Woman Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Lord, I had a woman
Lord knows she was good to me in every way
Yes, I had a woman
A real woman

Lord, she gave me love both night and day
My sunshine
Whoo hoo
For my woman
Or else or else
Its going to take me one more day
If it takes me
She went way down in Dallas
Way down in Texas land
Lord, she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger, baby
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand
I'm looking for my Dallas honey bee

[Outro]
Who can you be?
Who can you be?
Oooh hoo hoo help me
Help me look for her
Oh yeahYou might also likeEmbed
