Power of Soul - Live at Fillmore East 1/1/70 [Second Show] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shoot down some of those airplanes you've been driving
Especially the ones that fly too low
Shoot down some of those airplanes
Especially the ones that fly you too low
Come on back up to Earth, my friend
Come on back up with me
We all been through the night time, baby
Now let's reap the waves of reality

[Chorus]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible
[Verse 2]
Playing too much with one toy, baby
Leads, it leads, yeah, Into the foggy
It's so groovy to float around, sometimes
Even a jellyfish will tell you that
I said flotation is groovy and easy
Even a jellyfish will agree to that
Yeah, but old jellyfish been floating so long and so slack
Lord, and don't got a bone in his jelly back
Floating every day and every night, riding high is a risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right

[Chorus]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible

[Outro]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of you anything that you wanna do
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything that you wanna do
