Power of Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shoot down some of those airplanes your flying
Especially the ones that are flying too low
Shoot down some of those airplanes
Especially the ones that your flying too low

Come on back to earth my friend
Come on back up with me
We've all been up through the night time baby
Now let's read the rays of reality
[Chorus]
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do

[Verse 2]
Flying too much today
It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will tell you that
I said floatation is groovy
And he said
And a jelly fish will agree to that

Yeah, but that old jelly fish
Been floating around so long
Lord he hasn't got a bone in his jelly back
Floating every day and every night
Riding high is a risk
Sometimes the wind isn't right

[Chorus]
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do
You might also like[Chorus]
With the power of soul
Anything is possible
With the power of you
Anything you wanna do

[Outro]
With the power of you
Anything you want to doEmbed
