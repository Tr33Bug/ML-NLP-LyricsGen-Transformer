Send My Love to Linda Lyrics
Send my love to you
I'm sending all my love to you

Send my love to Linda
She lit a fire way down inside
She made the sun shine in my eye
God, let me hold her once more before I die

Sending my love to you
Sending my love to you
Sending my love to you
Send it to Linda
She lit a fire way down inside
She made the sun shine in my eye
God, let me hold her once more before I die
