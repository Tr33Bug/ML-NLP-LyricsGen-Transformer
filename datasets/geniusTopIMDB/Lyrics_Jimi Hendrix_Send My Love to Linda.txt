Send My Love to Linda Lyrics[Verse 1]
Send my love to you
I'm sending all my love to you

[Chorus]
Send my love to Linda
She lit a fire way down inside
She made the sun shine in my eye
God, let me hold her once more before I die

[Verse 2]
Sending my love to you
Sending my love to you
Sending my love to you
[Chorus]
Send it to Linda
She lit a fire way down inside
She made the sun shine in my eye
God, let me hold her once more before I die
