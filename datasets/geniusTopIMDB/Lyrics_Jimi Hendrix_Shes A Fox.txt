My girl it's all about your girl
The finest. Ditto. Fine!
She's got somethin lord

She's got a nice personality
And if you ever saw her you will agree

If you need it. Tee it off. Ditto
Need. She's a slub, lord knows girl
Cups so loud. Industriously

Some girls got it and some girls ain't
Some girls can do it, lord and some girls can't

She's a stow fox. My bea
She's a dissox now
