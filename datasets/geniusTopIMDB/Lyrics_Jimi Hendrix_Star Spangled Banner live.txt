Star Spangled Banner (live) LyricsO say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that star spangled banner yet wave
For the land of the free
And the home of the brave?You might also like1Embed
