Straight Ahead Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Hello my friend
So happy to see you again
I was so alone
All by myself i just couldn't make it

[Verse 1]
Have you heard baby
What the wind's blowin' round
Have you heard baby
A whole lot a people's coming right on down
Communication, yeah, is coming on strong
I don't give a damn baby
If your hair is short or long

I said get out of your grave
Oh, everybody is dancing in the street
Do what you know
Do not be slow
You got to practice what you preach
Yeah, because it is time for you and me
Come to face reality

Forget about the past baby
Things ain't what they used to be
Keep on straight ahead
Keep on straight ahead

[Chorus 2]
Straight ahead baby
Straight ahead baby
Whoo!

[Verse 2]
We got to stand side by side
We got to stand together and organize
Send power to the people, that's what they're screaming
Freedom of the soul
Pass it on, pass it on, to the young and the old
You might also likeYou got to tell the children the truth
They don't need a whole lot of lies
Because one of these days, baby
They'll be running things
So when you give them love
You better give it right
Woman and child, man and wife
The best love to have is the Love Of Life

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Hello my friend
It's so good to see you again
Hey now I've been all by myself
I don't think I can make it aloneEmbed
