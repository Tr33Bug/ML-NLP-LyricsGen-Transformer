Sweet Angel (Angel) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side"
[Verse 2]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"
