Voodoo Chile Blues Lyrics
I'm a voodoo chile, lord I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah
The night I was born, lord the moon stood a fire red
Said the night I was born, the moon turned a fire red
My poor mother her crying, she said "The gypsy was right!"
And she fell right dead

Hey, and he said "Fly on, fly on!", because I'm a voodoo chile, baby
Voodoo chile
