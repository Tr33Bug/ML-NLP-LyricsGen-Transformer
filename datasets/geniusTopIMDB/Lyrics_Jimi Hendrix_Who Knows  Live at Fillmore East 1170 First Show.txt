"The Fillmore is proud to welcome back some old friends with a brand new name, a Band of Gypsys!"

[Bridge]
They don't know
(They don't know)
Like I know
(Like I know)
Do you know
(They don't know)
I don't know
(I don't know)
What my baby
(About my baby)
Is putting down
(Putting down)
What my baby's
(Oh, my baby)
Putting down, baby
(Putting down now)
I just came back from
(I don't know)
Mexicali
(I been down there)
I just came back in town
(They don't know)
Looking for my Sally
(I don't know my baby)
Have you seen her?
(Running free, yeah)
Have you seen her
(Oooh hoo)
Talkin' about my baby
(Goin' down)
Talkin' about my baby
[Verse 1]
I just came in
I just came in baby
I just came in
I just came in
Spreading magic honey
All in my bed
She got chains, attached to my head
Talkin' about
Talkin' about
Talkin' about my baby
I don't know her

[Verse 2]
They don't know, what I know
They don't know, like I know
All the time been hangin' around
All the time I hang around
She didn't know
Ahh she didn't care
She didn't know
She didn't care
And she go walkin' down the street singin'
Everybody da
Da da dada da doo doo
Etc. (scat singing)

They don't know
Nobody knows
They don't know
Just don't know
