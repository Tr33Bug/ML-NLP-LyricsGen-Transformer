I Hung My Head Lyrics
Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brother's rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse, he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head

I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brother's rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
That's where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff, he asked me
"Why had I run?"
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead

I hung my head
I hung my head

Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
"Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury
What verdict they find"
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my

Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And he'd come to fetch me
To see what they'd done
And we'll ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy
For soon I'll be dead

I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head4Embed
