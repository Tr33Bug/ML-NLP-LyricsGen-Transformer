If I Were a Carpenter Lyrics
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby
If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you

I'd be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you

Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining?

If you were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
I'd miss my color blouse
And my soft shoe shining
You might also like
Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow

If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me?

I'd answered you, "Yes I would"
And would you not be above me

If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady

I'd marry you anyway
I'd have your baby

Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrowEmbed
