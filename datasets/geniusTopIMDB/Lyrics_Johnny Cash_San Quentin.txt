San Quentin Lyrics"I was thinking about you guys yesterday. Now, I've been here three times before, and I think I understand a little bit of how you feel about some things. It's none of my business how you feel about some other things, and I don't give a damn about how you feel about some other things. But anyway, I tried to put myself in your place, and I believe this is how I would feel about San Quentin..."

San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why

San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman, you can't understand
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good

San Quentin, you've been living hell to me
"Thank you very much. One more time? Maybe before we do it, though, if any of the guards are still speaking to me, can I have a glass of water?"
