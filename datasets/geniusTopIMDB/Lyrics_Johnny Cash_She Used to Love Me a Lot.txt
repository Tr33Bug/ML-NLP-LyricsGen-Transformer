She Used to Love Me a Lot Lyrics
I saw her through the window today
She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot
She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought I'd walk on in and I'd give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot
I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said "where have you been? It's been a while"
She was glad to see me, I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot

I remember how good it was back then
And I said "it's not too late to start again
We could spend the night together, take up where we left off"
She used to love me a lot
But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
"Yes I'm in need of something, but something you ain't got
But I used to love you a lot"

I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
Looking at her now I can't believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there, I've never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot

She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
