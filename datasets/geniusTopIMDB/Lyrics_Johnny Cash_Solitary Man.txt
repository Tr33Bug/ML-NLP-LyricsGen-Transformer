Solitary Man Lyrics
Belinda was mine until the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim
And loving him
Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought
Me and Sue
But that died, too

Don't know that I will but until I can find me
A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man
I've had it to here - being where love's a small word
A part time thing
A paper ring
I know it's been done having one girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong


Don't know that I will but until love can find me
And a girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
I'll be what I am
A solitary man
