Wayfaring Stranger Lyrics
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
There's no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright land to which I go

I'm going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones who've gone on

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep

I'm going there to see my Mother
She said she'd meet me when I come

So, I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over homeYou might also like2Embed
