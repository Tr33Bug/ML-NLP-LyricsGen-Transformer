Weâ€™ll Meet Again Lyrics
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day

Keep smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day
Yeah We'll meet again
I Don't know where
I Don't know when
But I do know
That We'll meet again
Some sunny day

So honey
Keep on smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away
You might also like
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I won't be long
And they'll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know
We'll meet again
Some sunny day1Embed
