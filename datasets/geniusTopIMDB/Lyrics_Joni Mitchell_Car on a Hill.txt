Car on a Hill Lyrics
I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio
He said he'd be over three hours ago
I've been waiting for his car on the hill
He makes friends easy, he's not like me
I watch for judgement anxiously
Now where in the city can that boy be?

Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill
He's a real good talker, I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend
But there's still no buzzer, they roll on
And I'm waiting for his car on the hill
It always seems so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter, when there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark

Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
