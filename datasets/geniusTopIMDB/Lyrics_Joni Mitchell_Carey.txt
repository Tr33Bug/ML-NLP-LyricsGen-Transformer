Carey Lyrics
The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And my fancy French cologne

Oh, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you fine
Come on down to the Mermaid Café
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon
You might also like
Come on, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy
But I like you

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But you're out of sight2Embed
