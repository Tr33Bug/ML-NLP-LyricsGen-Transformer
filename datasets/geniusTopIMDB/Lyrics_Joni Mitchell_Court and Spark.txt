Court and Spark Lyrics
Love came to my door with a sleeping roll and a madman's soul
He thought for sure I'd seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman to court and spark

He was playing on the sidewalk for passing change
When something strange happened, glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made in People's Park
And went looking for a woman to court and spark
It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him and still acting kind
He saw how I worried sometimes
I worry sometimes

"All the guilty people," he said, "they've all seen the stain
On their daily bread, on their Christian names
I cleared myself, I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me, I'd complete you."

His eyes were the color of the sand and the sea
And the more he talked to me, you know, the more he reached me
But I couldn't let go of L.A
City of the fallen angelsYou might also likeEmbed
