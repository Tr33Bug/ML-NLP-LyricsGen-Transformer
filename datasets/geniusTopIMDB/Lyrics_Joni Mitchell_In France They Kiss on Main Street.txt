In France They Kiss on Main Street Lyrics
Downtown, my darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence rock 'n' roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs a girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading in a suburban room

I said take me to the dance, do you want to dance?
I love to dance
And I told him they don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches and schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'
Downtown, the dancehalls and cafés
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise in those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings, drinking up the band's beers

Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars, kissing in cafés
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown in the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing "Bye, Bye, Love" while he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys come and carry us away

Sometimes Chickie had the car or Ron had the car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'
You might also like
Rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rock 'n' rollin'Embed
