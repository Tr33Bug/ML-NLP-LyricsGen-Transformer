Peopleâ€™s Parties Lyrics
All the people at this party, they've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries, they've got passport smiles
Some are friendly, some are cutting, some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre, giving to get something

Photo beauty gets attention, then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth and a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy, then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying laughing and crying, you know it's the same release
I told you when I met you I was crazy, cry for us all beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker and stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence, thinking I don't understand

I feel like I'm sleeping, can you wake me?
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings with a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to people's parties, fumbling deaf, dumb and blind

I wish I had more sense of humor, keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all awayYou might also like1Embed
