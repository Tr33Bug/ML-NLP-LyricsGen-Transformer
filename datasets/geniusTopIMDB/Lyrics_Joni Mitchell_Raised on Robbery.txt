Raised on Robbery Lyrics
He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion, he was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves

She says: "Let me sit down, you know, drinkin' alone's a shame
It's a shame, it's a crying shame
Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey, you've got lots of cash
Bring us 'round a bottle and we'll have some laughs
Gin's what I'm drinking, I was raised on robbery"
I'm a pretty good cook, I'm sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen, I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up after midnight cooking, trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasin', I was raised on robbery

We had a little money once
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars
You should have seen it fly away
First he bought a '57 Biscayne, he put it in a ditch
He drunk up all the rest, that son of a bitch
His blood's bad whiskey, I was raised on robbery

You know you ain't bad looking, I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey, I ain't asking for no full length mink
Hey, where you going? Don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when you're loaded, I was raised on robberyYou might also likeEmbed
