That Song about the Midway Lyrics
I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playin' on the horses, you were playin' on the guitar strings
You were playin' like a devil wearin' wings

Wearin' wings, you looked so grand wearin' wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing?
Can you fly? I heard you can, can you fly?
Like an eagle doin' your huntin' from the sky
I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheatin' once or twice

Once or twice, I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wond'rin' was the gamble worth the price?
Pack it in, I heard you did, pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win?

So lately you've been hidin', it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been workin' overtime

Over time, I've lost my fire over time
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down, I'm gettin' tired, slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found

Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down
Down, down, downYou might also likeEmbed
