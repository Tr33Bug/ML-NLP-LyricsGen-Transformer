The Hissing of Summer Lawns Lyrics
He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns

He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his to a Latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns
Darkness, wonder makes it easy
Darkness, with a joyful mask
Darkness, tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
No color, no contrast

A diamond dog carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns

He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale that nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
The hissing of summer lawns

Darkness
Darkness
