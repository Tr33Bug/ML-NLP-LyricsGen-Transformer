Twisted Lyrics
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
The way he described it, he said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along that he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought I was crazy but I'm not
Oh no

My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
He said I need treatment but I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight to be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts
They say as a child, I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas, but I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know that you're a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be

Now I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic, didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy?
I may have been only three but I was swinging

They all laugh at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry if they just couldn't understand
The idiomatic logic that went on in my head?
I had a brain, it was insane
Oh, they used to laugh at me when I refused to ride
On all those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top

My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
But I said, "Dear doctor, I think that it's you instead
Because I, I've got a thing that's unique and new
To prove it I'll have the last laugh on you
'Cause instead of one head, I got two
And you know two heads are better than one"You might also likeEmbed
