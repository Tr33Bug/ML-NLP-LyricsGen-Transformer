Woodstock Lyrics
I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, "Where are you going?"
And this he told me
I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna try and get my soul free

We are stardust
We are golden
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog
In something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

We are stardust
We are golden
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song
And celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation
You might also like
We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves back to the garden3Embed
