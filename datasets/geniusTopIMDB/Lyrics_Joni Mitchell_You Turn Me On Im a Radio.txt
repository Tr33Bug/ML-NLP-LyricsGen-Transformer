You Turn Me On, Iâ€™m a Radio Lyrics
If you're driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number who's bound to love you

Oh honey, you turn me on, I'm a radio
I'm a country station, I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower waving for you
I'm a broadcasting tower waving for you

And I'm sending you out this signal here
I hope you can pick it up loud and clear
I know you don't like weak women, you get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women 'cause they're hip to your tricks
It's been dirty for dirty down the line
But you know I come when you whistle when you're loving and kind

But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me then tune me out

'Cause honey, who needs the static, it hurts the head
And you wind up cracking and the day goes dismal
From "Breakfast Barney" to the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm going to tell you again now if you're still listening there

If you're driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number who's bound to love you
If you're lying on the beach with the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies, honey, the love's still flowing
If your head says forget it but your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station, the lines are openYou might also like1Embed
