Angel Lyrics
Angel, put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again

Oh angel, we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began

And I know we'll find, a better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want, for you and me
Angel won't you set me free
Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun

When I close my eyes, I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms, oh, can't you see
Angel shine your light on me

Angel we'll meet once more, I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh, angel take me far away

Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise againYou might also like6Embed
