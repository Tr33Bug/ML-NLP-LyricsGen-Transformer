Deceiver Lyrics
Solar winds are blowing
Neutron star controlling
All is lost, doomed and tossed, at what cost forever

Meteors fly around me
Comets die, and then they
And then they, you wanna see how they try to surround me
I can say, here today, we shall stay forever

If you want to find us in a hurry
Oh let me tell you don't you worry
I can't say, here today, we shall stay foreverYou might also like1Embed
