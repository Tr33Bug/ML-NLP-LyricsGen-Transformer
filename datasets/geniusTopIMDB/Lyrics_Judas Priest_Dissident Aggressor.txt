Dissident Aggressor Lyrics
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected, subjected to all

Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what I am, I'm Berlin


Exploding, reloading, this quest never-ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm BerlinYou might also like2Embed
