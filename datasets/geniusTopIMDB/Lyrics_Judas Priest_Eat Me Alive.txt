Eat Me Alive Lyrics
Wrapped tight around me like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body as the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable, let rip

And eat me alive
Eat me alive

Sounds like an animal, panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone and gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy that deranges every joint
I'm going to force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Eat me alive


Bound to deliver as you give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as the rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum, spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all

So eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive

Eat me alive
Alive, alive, alive

Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
