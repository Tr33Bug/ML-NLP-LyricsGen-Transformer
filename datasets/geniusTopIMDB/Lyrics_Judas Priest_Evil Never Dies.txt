Evil Never Dies Lyrics
The devil's moved from Georgia
His mission's still the same
The world's become his oyster once again
If you don't think you're worthy
And you don't meet the cause
He knows what's going on behind closed doors

Beware there's voodoo in the night
Evil never dies
Evil never dies

A master of deception
Who takes you by the hand
Then leads you to the palace of the damned
He pulls the strings inside you
And plays upon your fears
Your final scream is music to his ears

Beware there's voodoo in the night

Evil never dies
Evil never dies


I'm caught up in this voodoo
Trying to break free
I feel I'm being smothered
Trapped by this entity
Blackened clouds surround me
Filling me with dread
I can't escape the horror
With the devil in my head
He relishes the suffering
Can't stand this heart attack
My life's been taken hostage
And it's never coming back
You might also like

Beware there's voodoo in the night
The devil's got you in his sight

Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never diesEmbed
