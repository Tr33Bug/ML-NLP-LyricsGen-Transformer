Exciter Lyrics
Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon, blazing to the land
Now, he's here amongst us, the age of fire's at hand

Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
Everything he touches fries into a crisp
Let him get close to you so you're in his trip
First you'll smoke and smolder, blister up and singe
When ignition hits you the very soul of your being will cringe

Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please


Who is this man? Where is he from?
Exciter comes for everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue

He's come to make you snap out of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you see the light again
So much self-indulgence results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency leads to beguiling lies
You might also like
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask

When he leaps amidst us with combustive dance
All shall bear the branding of his thermal lance
Cauterizing masses melting into one
Only when there's order will his job be done

Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Bow to your knees and repent if you please


Who is this man? Where is he from?
Exciter comes for everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon, blazing to the land
Now, he's here amongst us, the age of fire's at hand
