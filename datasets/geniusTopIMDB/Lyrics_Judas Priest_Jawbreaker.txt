Jawbreaker Lyrics
Deadly as the viper peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
