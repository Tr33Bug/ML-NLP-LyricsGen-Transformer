Lightning Strike Lyrics
I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make


You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell
You might also like
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike

Lightning will strike!3Embed
