Living After Midnight Lyrics
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long

You might also like
The air's electric, sparking power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning1Embed
