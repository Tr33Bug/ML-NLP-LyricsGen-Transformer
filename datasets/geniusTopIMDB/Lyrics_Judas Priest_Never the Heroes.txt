Never the Heroes Lyrics
Like a cobra, they will strike
And like lions caged we'll fight
We were taken not by choice
They put anger in our voice

We were fearless but so afraid
Though in our hearts we still felt pain
We're on fire but on a leash
We only ever wanted peace
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war

Like a demon leads the youth
We are terrible in truth
No time to falter, no turning back
When we come under attack

There is no question as with a friend
We have our honour to defend
We're on fire but on a leash
We only ever wanted peace

Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war
At war

We are together till the end
We have our honour to defend

Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed
Never the heroes (We were never the heroes)
We were made to fight (We were made to fight)
Never the heroes, we were sacrificed at warYou might also like4Embed
