No Surrender Lyrics
You know that life isn't set
I lead the pack I ain't no pretender
You give as good as you get
We live and die cause there's no surrender

Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
You know the way that I feel
If you're with me you better hold on tighter
I'm only keeping it real
That's who I am, I'm just a non-stop fighter

Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender

Run out of road
The end of the days
Not for the weak
Only the brave


Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender

I'm chasing a dream as I go higher
You know I'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire
I'm living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender3Embed
