Out in the Cold Lyrics

I'm laying awake at nights
I can't get you out of my mind
All I can hear is my heartbeat
And the voice in the dark of some kind

Where are you now?
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold
Out in the cold
Hear me calling, cold
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

I know it was you I hurt
(I didn't mean to hurt you)
So much to forgive and forget
Can't take anymore of this hurt
(Oh no, oh no)
There's so many things I regret

Where are you now?
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

(Shut me out)
Out in the cold
(Where are you now?)
Hear me calling
(I need you, I'm so cold)
(Can't you hear my heartbeat?)
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
You might also like
Give me a chance baby
Ah, there's nothing I wouldn't do to make it alright
Just one more chance baby
I need all your loving tonight


Where are you now?
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh, I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though I'm out in the cold

(Shut me out)
Out in the cold
(Where are you now?)
Hear me calling
(I need you, I'm so cold)
(Can't you hear my heartbeat?)
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
(Why don't you rescue me?)
Cold

(Shut me out)
Out in the cold
(Where are you now?)
Hear me calling
(I need you, I'm so cold)
(Can't you hear my heartbeat?)
Out in the cold
Please rescue me

(Why don't you rescue me?)
I'm so cold

(Shut me out)
Out in the cold
(Where are you now?)
Hear me calling
(I need you, I'm so cold)
(Can't you hear my heartbeat?)
Out in the cold
Please rescue meEmbed
