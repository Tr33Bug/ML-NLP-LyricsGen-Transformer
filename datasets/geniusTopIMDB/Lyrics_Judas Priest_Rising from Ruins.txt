Rising from Ruins Lyrics
Drawn from years of self denying
Lost in chaos before the storm
Our strength goes on prepared for mortal battle
We can settle our old scores (Our old scores)

Look to the stars and challenge all of Heaven
Resist the Devil, dare to dream
By grace of God within our hearts eternal
For our salvation is for everyone
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins

We'll face our foes so they can hear our voices
The land rejoices in empathy
This trial by fire will build from their attrition
It's ammunition for our enemies

We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins

Send in the valiant, fight for what you believe
Then we shall overcome, lay victory at our feet
You might also like

We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We bring the lights
Out from the night
Rising from ruins

We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruinsEmbed
