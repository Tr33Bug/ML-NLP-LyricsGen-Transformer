(Take These) Chains Lyrics
I move away, it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would
Help me, begging you please
You got the power, down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be

Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run, but I'm tied to you like a slave
It's my fault loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know?
You turned mean overnight
Poor, poor me

Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart

I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life?
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night


Help me, I'm begging you please
You got the power, down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be
You might also like
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heartEmbed
