Victim of Changes Lyrics
Whiskey woman, don't you know that you are drivin' me insane?
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Don't you know you're driving me insane?
You're tryin' to find your way through life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find no new connection

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through
Take another look around, you're not going anywhere
You've realized you're gettin' old and no one seems to care
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to get some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't get a new, oh

Takes another drink or two
Things look better when she's through

You've been foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up, get out, you know you really blew it
I've had enough, I've had enough, good God, pluck me


Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine (Once she was mine)
Change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesn't see me anymore
