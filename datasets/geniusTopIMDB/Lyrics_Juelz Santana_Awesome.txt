Awesome, she awesome
My bitch is so awesome
Yeah, she awesome

She awesome, my bitch is so awesome
I done been with all them; she better than all them (yeah)

She look like the kind of girl that I would like to sponsor (yeah)
Butt like a truck I think I'm gonna call her Tonka
Titties so pretty like she drew with a marker
If I could use two words to describe her she awesome (she awesome)
She awesome, I think Im gonna ti-ti-tip her
Body booming like a system, I'm the radio killa, killa
Plus she hold it down for her nigga (yup)
So she deserves everything I give her (yeah)
Yeah I keep her fresh (yeah), yeah I pay her rent (yeah)
No I don't trip (yeah), nigga I invest cause
She awesome, she awesome - my bitch is so awesome
I done been with all them; she better than all them
She awesome, she awesome - my bitch is so awesome
I done been with all them; she better than all them
Them other bitches don't know what to call them
But I know what to call you: you awesome, you awesome
Them other bitches don't know what to call them
But I know what to call you: you awesome, you awesome

Uh, she outta mind, she outta sight (yeah)
Fuck a fire cracker, my bitch is dynamite (uh-huh)
Thought I was superman (damn), she got that kryptonite (damn)
And we so connected, satellite
These other bitches buggin', they just parasites
And they don't have a life, they wish they had your life
I'm never hungry cause you satisfy my appetite
That ass is apple right so dont mind if I have a bite
Look at you, you so fucking beautiful (yeah)
Standing there with nothing on - I know what to do with you (hmm)
Look like a bag of mula got me thinking bout the jeweler
Not a ring, but a watch, matching rollies how I do ya (haha)
YSL, Chanel, Celine, Mcqueen
That's a must; none of that canal street stuff
Got a smile like Colgate, smart with a dope shape
Both rocking red bottoms looking like soul mates

I done been with all them; she better than all them

Pull up in that all what? What is that tour bus?
What is that Givenchy? Got these bitches star struck
Now they speaking on us, on me, on thee
Fact that I got women by the armies in arm reach
Salutening, misogynistic sue me
And that convo got yo inspired mascato make her woozy
And I gotta tell ya truly not your booty its your beauty
No offense that plane ticket I'mma get you two seats truly out
Whoo, and that's a compliment baby love
I'm just relaying all the feelings I don't say is much
And really who gonna say its love, and really gonna say it ain't
But until that bouquet go up, I tell you this err'day
