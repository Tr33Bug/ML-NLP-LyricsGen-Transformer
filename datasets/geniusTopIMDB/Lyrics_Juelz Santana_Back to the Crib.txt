Back to the Crib Lyrics
Santana, yeah

P-O-L-O Da Don, yeah
Haha, we got one, ayy, yeah (what up?)

Shawty said she really feeling me
Like yeah, oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah
Shawty said she wanna roll with me
I said yeah, oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
I think we got one right here, ayy
She don't know that we going back to the crib
'Cause she know that I'm on her
Yeah, haha
She don't know that we going back to the crib
Back to the crib, yeah
What you say? Let's go get it, let's go
She wanna roll with me, she wanna go with me
But she don't know I'm tryna take her back home with me
I told her have a seat in my ride
She said I look like I taste good and she wanna eat me alive
She lookin' good in them new tall heels
I'm lookin' at her like a full course meal
Chill, I got all the girls checkin' me
They know I'm a dog but they love my pedigree
Yeah, just call me Mr. Orgasm
And if you come with me, I guarantee you gon' have one
The hottest in the hood, the freshest on the block (c'mon)
Why stop all this Gucci and the Louis that I rock?
If not, I stay Polo down to the socks
Rings, chains and watch worth more than Fort Knocks
Temporary plates on the Audi R8
Diamonds match what I'm wearin', she can't stop starin' (haha)

Shawty said she really feeling me
Like yeah, oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
Shawty said she wanna roll with me
I said yeah, oh yeah (yeah, yeah)
She don't know that we going back to the crib
'Cause she know that I'm on her
She don't know that we going back to the crib
Back to the crib, yeah

Runway walk, beauty queen face
Video body, see the curves and the shape (woah)
And everythin' her mama gave her, she know how to shake
Thicker than a milkshake and I'm tryna get a taste
Hair did, manicure, pedicure
Attitude like Vivica, when she played in Set It Off
She feelin' my swag, she feelin' my G
Not only is she dancin', she feelin' on me
And I'm feelin' you too, so I put my hands on her
Just to let her know the feelings mutual
No mama, we could birthday text
Yes, I said text but I know you know what I really meant (sex)
Tell me what you will do, tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you don't know how to do
So I could show you (uh-huh)
I'ma give it to you give it to you like I owe you
And after I'm done, I'ma tell you I told you, so

Shawty said she really feeling me
Like yeah, oh yeah, I'm like, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Shawty said she wanna roll with me
I said yeah, oh yeah, oh, no, girl (yeah, yeah)
She don't know that we going back to the crib
'Cause she know that I'm on her
She don't know, she don't know
She don't know that we going back to the crib
Back to the crib, oh, baby yeah
Shawty said she really feeling me
Like yeah, oh yeah, oh, baby, woo (yeah, yeah)
Shawty said she wanna roll with me
I said yeah, oh yeah, I said yeah, I said, yeah (yeah, yeah)
She don't know that we going back to the crib
'Cause she know that I'm on her, they don't know
She don't know that we going back to the crib
Back to the crib, yeah, we going, going
You should know me
I can see myself in your future (hey, hey)
That's hood, O.G., I made up my mind
I'm choosing ya (hey, hey)
Don't say, you won't try to lean in
I'm fiending, yeah (hey, hey)
The apartment's waiting on us, girl
Meet me at the valet, Lamborghini Breezy
I'ma transform ya, name you Mrs. Breezy
Stunting so hard but I make it look easy
Let's do it like we do it when we doing it for TV, yeah
