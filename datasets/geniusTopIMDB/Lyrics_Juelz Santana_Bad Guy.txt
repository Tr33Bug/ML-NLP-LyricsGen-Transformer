Bad Guy Lyrics
You're all a bunch of fuckin' assholes
You know why? You don’t have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me
You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers and say, "That's the bad guy"
So, what that make you? Good? You’re not good
You just know how to hide, how to lie
Me? I don’t have that problem

Uh, say hello to the bad guys
Feds takin' pictures, hope they got my good side (Yeah)
The price of life's gettin' cheaper And I'm just gettin' richer, lil' nigga (Lil' Nigga)
Nigga talkin' static, I hear feedback, eat that
Niggas lame and they rejects, I see that (I see that)
Believe that (Believe that)
Shotty bounce, body count
28 bodies found, killin' niggas by the ounce (Ooooh)
Niggas get killed tryna play tough (Yep)
Niggas get killed tryna play us (Yep)
Wassup? Don't be a fuckin' dumb dumb (Dumb)
I get your whole clique hit for a lump sum (Bow!)
Uh, brought guns to the knife war (Yeah)
Fuck a nigga tryna fight for (Naw)
When that sawed off could knock your jaw off (Heh)
Don't make my young boys knock yours off (Whooo!)
I know niggas that'll shoot you then go to your funeral (Yeah)
I know niggas that'll kill you then pay for a mural (Yeah)
Just to stand in front of it and take a picture wit'chu (Damn)
Shit, you niggas accident murderers
Got professionals, make it look like a accident, murderers (Murderers)
Then I got my reckless murderers
Dropped a gun, cops come, they go gon' tell 'em they murdered ya (Tell 'em)
Harlem's new Bumpy Johnson, protecting my empire, uh, Nucky Thompson

Uh, say hello to the bad guys
Feds takin' pictures, hope they got my good side (Yeah)
The price of life's gettin' cheaper And I'm just gettin' richer, lil' nigga (Lil' Nigga)
Nigga talkin' static, I hear feedback, eat that
Niggas lame and they rejects, I see that (I see that)
Believe that (Believe that)
Shotty bounce, body count (Ooooh)
28 bodies found, killin' niggas by the ounce

There's a war going on outside, nobody safe (Nope)
Gotta ball to you fall, if not, life's a waste (Yeah)
Gotta watch them niggas, they tryna take your place (Watch)
Tell them money hungry niggas my gun is all on the plate (Aight)
Clip so long it's hangin' off the plate (Yeah)
I got enough for whoever ain't ate (Who else?)
Extra clips for a side dish (Uh), who want try this? (Haha)
Still got bricks, who want try this? (This)
I don't cook coke (Nope), I deep fry fish (Fish)
Fly nigga, she just wanna see the cockpit (Haha)
Hot topic, dead bodies in the courtyard (Yard)
Fuck it, keep the money comin' like porn stars (Porn stars)
I could get you killed for a bag of reefer (Reefer)
I could get you laced for a pair of sneakers (Sneakers)
Imagine what these niggas do for a feature (Imagine)
And the story gets even deeper (Yeah)

Uh, say hello to the bad guys
Feds takin' pictures, hope they got my good side
The price of life's getting cheaper And I'm just gettin' richer, lil' nigga (Lil' nigga)
Nigga talkin' static, I hear feedback, eat that
Niggas lame and they rejects, I see that (I see that)
Believe that
Shotty bounce, body count
28 bodies found (Uh, AH-HAAEEEH), killin' niggas by the ounce
Now what I do? go out, get it, try to bring it back (Yeah)
They always gon' need somebody to point the finger at (Uh-huh)
On me now harder than they was when I was slingin' crack
I'm a tax payin' citizen, I ain't slingin' jack
Keep my name in the mix 'cause they know me
I ain't never hung out wit' 'em, we ain't homies
A lot of the hate really come from bein' lonely
And as soon as you stop fuckin' with 'em, you bein' phony (Mhm)
I ain't playin' with 'em (Nah)
Shotty for the youngsters
Give 'em the whole thing (Yep), body in the dumpsters
Truer niggas that tie niggas up, call it the trunksters (Mhm)
The way I'm on it, it's like a new Gotti is amongst us
What!

Uh, say hello to the bad guys
Feds takin' pictures, hope they got my good side
The price of life's getting cheaper And I'm just gettin' richer, lil' nigga (Lil' nigga)
Nigga talkin' static, I hear feedback, eat that
Niggas lame and they rejects, I see that (I see that)
Believe that
Shotty bounce, body count
28 bodies found, killin' niggas by the ounceEmbed
