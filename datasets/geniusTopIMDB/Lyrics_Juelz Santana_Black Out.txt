Black Out Lyrics
Fly nigga, I'm taking off (whooo, uh)
Fly-fly nigga I'm taking off (yeah, ay)

Fly nigga, I'm taking off (uh), bad bitches, they take it off (uh)
Oh that look like what's her name, yeah what's her name's baby mom's (yeah)
I eat the pussy, no plate or fork; the pussy bushy, gotta shave it off (uh)
She said band's make her dance, I'm beating drums and blowing horns
She told me that if I give her a tip she give me bank head like Bowen Homes
She tried to lock that pussy up, but I came through like bail bonds
White seat (yeah), white mink (yeah), white car, I'm the black Fonz (Fonz)
Www.I-fucked-the-shit-out-of-her.com
Say yeah nigga I'm back (I'm back), yeah nigga I'm back (I'm back)
Tell Mitt Romney fall back, my president still black
I ain't gotta press no buttons nigga, I wake up with my swag on
Y'all niggas is broke (broke) your pockets should have a cast on (hah)
Bitches think I'm a photographer, my next tape with that flash on
My waist stay with that flash on, it's lights out when I clap on
I'm lit nigga, I'm lit nigga, like Times Square when the ball drop (drop)
Word is they be sleeping on me, well make this they alarm clock
Bitch I..
Black out in that pussy, I black out in that pussy
I'm addicted, like she got a crackhouse in that pussy
Man I smash out in that pussy, then I pass out in that pussy
We stomp that nigga out, and watch him drag out that pussy

She don't even know me like that, uh
But she gon' learn today, yeah
And every big dog like cat, girl
And they done let me out my cage and she told me
She need me in her life, but I told her
You need dick in your life, and she said
You know, you're probably right
Great minds think alike, and then I paint her white
So I can

Black out in that pussy, I black out in that pussy
I'm addicted, like she got a crackhouse in that pussy
Man I smash out in that pussy, then I pass out in that pussy
We stomp that nigga out, and watch him drag out that pussy

Living la vida loca, I hate being sober
These niggas sayin' I broke but, I bet them nigga broker (ha)
I'm Batman and you Joker's, she gave me neck, choke her
And I have the super, so yeah nigga I soaked her (yup)
Damn, that's your lady? Damn, that's your lady?
She got your name tatted, that's crazy, I cover that with my babies (yup)
Told her to come downstairs, we did it all in my Caddy'
Asked her where them kids is at, she said upstairs with they daddy (WHOOO)
Money coming in by the packs, everyday I pop tags
In the club wasting this cash; bitch, keep bouncing that ass
She said real niggas don't last, they say real niggas don't last
Nah, it's just too many fake niggas making real niggas look bad
Get lost with your lame ass, livin' fast - no brake pads
Stop (stop), wait (wait), now frame that
My lifestyle ain't for bitch niggas, I use lifestyles on your bitch, nigga
I see a bitch, I want a bitch, and I just tell my bitch get it
And I

Black out in that pussy, I black out in that pussy
I'm addicted, like she got a crackhouse in that pussy
Man I smash out in that pussy, then I pass out in that pussy
We stomp that nigga out, and watch him drag out that pussy1Embed
