Blog That Lyrics
Just put a picture up on Instagram
Now I'm in the kitchen whipping Insta-grams
I'm getting money nigga, blog that
Your girl wanna fuck me nigga, blog that
You a hater, eat a dick nigga, blog that
I just bought another whip nigga, blog that
I'm back, tell the motherfucking blogs that
And I'm bout to pop it off, bra strap

Fresh off my hiatus, fresh off my hiatus
Santana back in business, now let's get reacquainted
I'm that nigga, A.K.A. not the one to play with
I'm all these bitches favorite
I'm flyer than your planets
Big gun where my waist is
Screaming out hi haters
All you niggas targets, I'm just shooting, I'm not aiming
Still whipping that Katy, still whipping that Katy
Perry till she ready, then I pass it, Tom Brady
Twenty bands in the rubber band
On my neck about one hundred grand
Blood diamonds like I just came from the motherland
Told you niggas I'd be up again

Fly up, or get flown over
Swag up, or get swagged on
Boss up or get bossed around
We don't cuff hoes, they get passed on
Bad bitches, I got that
Big money, I got that
Four doors, coupes with the top back, I got that
Still keep that big thing and that thing'll blow your top back
Who said they gon' take something? We right here, they ain't take nothing
Fall back or get flat lined
Red beam on that black nine
Cold steel with these hot shells, you talk shit and I back mine
I ball even when it's halftime
Your bitch call, it's that time
I'm lit like a candle, she tryna' get her wax on
If it ain't the 'Rari, it's the Bentley Mussolini
Or the Phantom or the Ghost, wondering if they can see me
Hash tag, my bitch bad
Hash tag, my jewels real
Hash tag, my pockets fat
And that's cause I just made a sale
Hash tag my clique kill
Your bitch think I'm a big deal
Fucked up with my J's on, hit her with that windmill
