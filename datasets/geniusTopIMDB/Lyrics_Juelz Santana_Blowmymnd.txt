Blowmymnd LyricsBlunt full of that Buddha
Car full of them shooters
Bad chick from Bermuda
But my Brazilian girl even cuter
She drop down to her knees like 'I don't do this all the time'
And that's when I reply
Girl you know you lyin'
I looked right in her eyes and said 'girl you know you fine'
She said men think with they penis
So I told her blow my mind
That foreign car parked outside
She know that shit is mine
And a real ni-a, son, like me
She know that's hard to find
I pulled up, I'm turnt up
No, I don't wait on no line
That Jesus piece, that cuban link
Versace shades on my eyes
Now I know how B.I.G. felt
I'm strapped boy, no seat belt
You a bitch nigga, yeah a female
I'm a G male, no E-mail
Still got that comeback
Wholesale and retail
I'm riding on that money train
And I don't wanna be derailed
I don't pop them mollies
But I know that she will
I'm high up, that weed smell
And that codeine got me ill
45 on my hip, 45 on my wrist
2 45 for my whip, now that's what I call lick
Vegas night roulette table, lost 45 in one spin
I'm a harlem nigga, I double duck, bet 45 again
Lost that, made it right back, in a 45 minute trip
Nigga wanted to and I fronted 2, charging 45 each brick
Nigga you road boat, and I'm show boat
And you're joe rogan, I'm hulk hogan
My car foreign, next season
You jet skiing, my jet leaving
And I brought your girl with me
She a zombie, she be head eating
Wanna see a movie come see me
Fuck hd, I'm 3d
What I smoke be 1 hunned
And I'm 300 like chief keef
Screaming oh I, bang, bang, you know the drill
Overkill
Fly up, or get flown over
Swag up, or get swagged on
Boss up or get bossed around
We don't cuff hoes, they get passed on
Bad bitches, I got that
Big money, I got that
Four doors, coupe ? , top back, I got that
Still keep that big thing and that thing'll blow your top back
Who said they gon' take something? We right here, they ain't take nothing
Fall back or get flat lined
Red beam on that black nine
Cold steel with these hot shells, you talk shit and I back mineYou might also like1Embed
