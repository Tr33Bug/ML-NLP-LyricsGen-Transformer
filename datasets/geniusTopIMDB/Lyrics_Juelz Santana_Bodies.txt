Bodies Lyrics
We put it down, we give it up
We lookin' down cause we so up
We put 'em down, now pick 'em up
We lookin' down, cause we so up
(At the top) bodies keep on poppin' up
(At the top) cops wanna question us
(At the top) but we got nothin' to discuss
(At the top) Just keep them bodies pilin' up

Ain't gettin' money can't get with us
These niggas, they ain't with us
Heard Juelz and Reese, she was quick to fuck
Can't trust niggas that's why it's only us
These niggas be actin up and if these niggas keep actin' up
Ain't got let chopper make noise nigga, 4-5'll be loud enough
And tell them niggas don't challenge us, big mode in my challenger
Come through like zoom nigga, big gun like boom nigga (boom)
Big dogs need food nigga, you fuck around and get chewed nigga
Memorial day for you nigga and it won't be in Cancun nigga
You a smart boy, school nigga, I ain't none of that, I'm a fool nigga
3 hunnid like 3 o'clock with your punk ass after school nigga
Swept up with that broom nigga, hit his ass with that T-Pain
That auto'll tune niggas, that +Heat+ with me like D-Wade
I can smell the pussy on you niggas, you bitch-made, perfume nigga
All fake, cartoon nigga, I make a casket your room nigga (boom)

We put it down, we give it up
We lookin' down cause we so up
We put 'em down, now pick 'em up
We lookin' down, cause we so up
(At the top) bodies keep on poppin' up
(At the top) cops wanna question us
(At the top) but we got nothin' to discuss
(At the top) Just keep them bodies pilin' up

Ain't gettin' money can't get with us
These niggas, they ain't with us
Heard Juelz and Reese, she was quick to fuck
Can't trust niggas that's why it's only us

And I live it up, throwin' 3 hunnid up, bodies gettin' dropped, police hot as fuck (man down)
We love stains, now give it up, now you down and I'm up (uh)
Snitch niggas givin' names up; when the people hit the bar we put them things up
I never switch up cause I'm the same one, we on your ass, ain't no letting up
We at the top, haters lookin' up in a film with them niggas who don't give no fucks
And, uh, all-all my niggas wild as fuck
And-and, uh, fuck niggas be mad as fuck
And, uh, counting paper, I got paper cuts

We put it down, we give it up
We lookin' down cause we so up
We put 'em down, now pick 'em up
We lookin' down, cause we so up
(At the top) bodies keep on poppin' up
(At the top) cops wanna question us
(At the top) but we got nothin' to discuss
(At the top) Just keep them bodies pilin' up

Uh, bodies keep on poppin' up
Bodies keep on poppin' up
Bodies keep on poppin' up
Just keep them bodies pilin' up {*echoes*}2Embed
