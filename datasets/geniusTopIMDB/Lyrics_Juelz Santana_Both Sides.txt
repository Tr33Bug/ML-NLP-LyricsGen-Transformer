Both Sides LyricsRonnie-Ronnie-Ron...

No niggas want these problems (let's get it)
Young real niggas and we ballin' (ballin')
My poker face, I'm going all in (ells)
From Chicago back to Harlem (let's get it)
These niggas can't fuck with us (why)
These niggas can't fuck with us (let's get it)
From Chicago back to Harlem (ells)
These niggas can't fuck with us (let's get it)
WOOOOO, aight
I be going hard with my Chicago niggas (yea)
If it's beef, fold 'em up, make 'em a taco nigga (yea)
Keep that trigger like a motherfucking throttle nigga (uh)
The more I rev it up the quicker bodies dropping nigga
My pockets cheesy (cheesy), lasagna nigga (uh)
My neck clear (clear), vodka nigga (vodka nigga)
I'm eating good (good), Benihana nigga (haha)
Still selling white, Pina Colada nigga
My new connect, he got it like he Pablo nigga
You gon' rob who? You a liar nigga
Fast money, never slowing up, these niggas can't fuck with us
Bang bang, anywhere, yeah these niggas know what's up with us

No niggas want these problems (let's get it)
Young real niggas and we ballin' (ballin')
My poker face, I'm going all in (ells)
From Chicago back to Harlem (let's get it)
These niggas can't fuck with us (why)
These niggas can't fuck with us (let's get it)
From Chicago back to Harlem (ells)
These niggas can't fuck with us (let's get it)

See Cabrini Greens (true), went and tore 'em down (paper)
Like 9/11 my 911, the roof fall down (tell em)
On the southside (what), north's true king (cool)
Let the birds fly, like two wings
All a man need in his life man is two things (right)
Balls and his word (what), that's true thing (kill)
You know 300, like O Block
Them my young niggas, them 300 in your whole block (boom, boom, boom)
Fly nigga, simple with it, gold watch
Summertime, Air 1â€™s, no socks, and the hoes jock (chill)
At the top there's a lot of fuck niggas (fuck em though)
But them niggas know I don't give a fuck nigga

I be going hard for my Harlem niggas (let's get it)
Talk to them, that A.K. takin' part to niggas (ells)
My shooters ain't gon' argue with you (rrrah)
I just bought a chopper, it play target with you (bang)
Juelz in the cut, not my nigga Fredo (Santana)
Be cool before your t-shirt turn into a dago (rrrah)
My youngin's in the field, shawty they don't play though (number 9)
And I love New York, like my nigga Tego (ells)
I just spend a chicken on my breitling bitch (my watch)
Bitch I pack a punch, on some Tyson shit (rrrah)
And I run my city and I'm liking it (Chi-raq)
Bitch I run my city and I'm liking it (ells)
