Clickin Lyrics
Hello {*echoes*}
Hello {*echoes*}
Yeah, yeah, uh...

Hello? (Hello?) What up, nigga? (What up, nigga?)
Hello? (Hello?) What up, bitch? (What up, bitch?)
Who me? (Who me?) I'm doing fine (I'm doing fine)
Hold on, I got that money calling on the other line
My phone clickin' (clickin') my phone clickin' (hello)
If you ain't talking bout money, I ain't tryna' listen
My phone clickin' (hello), my phone clickin' (uh)
I got that phone clickin' (uh) my phone clickin'
My phone clickin' (chick-clickin') hope that's the plug
That's just your girl, I know what she want
My phone clickin' (click-clickin') is that you honey?
Not you bitch, thought I was talking to the money
Phone clickin', you need something? My phone clickin', you need something? (Huh)
Treat beef like climaxin', tell them pussies I keep busting
All you do is listen, you air hustlin', my phone clickin', I'm air hustlin' (yeah)
Rick Ross when he came out, everyday I'm still +Hustlin'+ (uh)
Hit the block and I'm head huntin', big gun like I'm deer huntin'
Bring it back like cook crack, yeah nigga, I still trouble (yeah)
Blowing money, I'm still stuntin', take mine, I dare someone
Like 2 Chainz I kill weaves, but I send 'em back with they hair done
My eyes low from the loud (loud), I'm comatose
I need a new safe, my shit done overflowed
Just called the bank, my account on overload
Still got that Novocaine, bitch don't overdose

Hello? (Hello?) What up, nigga? (What up, nigga?)
Hello? (Hello?) What up, bitch? (What up, bitch?)
Who me? (Who me?) I'm doing fine (I'm doing fine)
Hold on, I got that money calling on the other line
My phone clickin' (clickin') my phone clickin' (hello)
If you ain't talking bout money, I ain't tryna' listen
My phone clickin' (hello), my phone clickin' (uh)
I got that phone clickin' (uh) my phone clickin'

Boy my trap jumpin My phone clickin' (hello)
You owe me something (pussy), and the clock tickin' (tick, tick, tick)
My phone clickin', my bitch drippin'
My work ain't jumping back, I'm in the kitchen clickin' (work)
Bitch I feel like JFK (chea), traveling the world while you niggas hate (hah)
Blew a twenty piece in K.O.D., other piece in D.O.A. (Chea)
Bitch called me on three-way (three-way), niggas better pre-pay
Cause once I get this work in (work), I'mma hit the E-way
Pulled up in a Phantom, you don't know the feeling
Money to the ceiling, tryna' make a killing
Ain't got time for these bitches cause I'm on my grind
Clicked over, tell that ho I'm on the other line (hello)
Bitch, I'm gone... bitch, I'm on
Fuck you sayin'...

Hello? (Hello?) What up, nigga? (What up, nigga?)
Hello? (Hello?) What up, bitch? (What up, bitch?)
Who me? (Who me?) I'm doing fine (I'm doing fine)
Hold on, I got that money calling on the other line
My phone clickin' (clickin') my phone clickin' (hello)
If you ain't talking bout money, I ain't tryna' listen
My phone clickin' (hello), my phone clickin' (uh)
I got that phone clickin' (uh) my phone clickin'1Embed
