Dipâ€™d In Coke Lyrics
La musica de Harry Fraud
That be maaly raw
See I done did everything when I could, and when I could
And if I could do this shit all again I would, all again I would
I wouldn't change shit
Cause if you see me now I'm on the same shit
I said if you see me now I'm on the same tip
Y'all bitches won't never see my game switch

I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Montana, know you fuckin' with the best y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Santana, know you fuckin' with the best y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Coke Boys, know you fuckin' with the best y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Dipset, bitch you fuckin' with the best y'all
It ain't a photoshoot, we do this every night
I got to take it easy, Eric Wright
Shawty acting up, put her on connecting flight
I stay flee strap on, I get dressed for life
Ooh, got to have it, got to have it
A thousand thread count, come and check out the fabric
Purple city, purple drink, Lenny Kravitz
Blue diamonds, Michael Finley, yeah I'm talking Mary
Mobb Deep still shining, talkin' Harry
I'm talkin' David Copperfield, I'm talkin' magic
I'm talkin' what they talk about if they livin' after
I'm talkin' Lazarus, I'm talkin ash to ash
Dust to dust, like Cassius Clay was at it
Picasso drawing, Eminem, Marshall Mathers
Average to lavish, Dr. Dre, Aftermathin'
If you talkin' me and money, yeah I'm talkin' marriage
I'm talking mixing yellow with the purple, talkin' Magic
Talkin' Johnson and Johnson, mix it with the ashes

I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Montana, know you fuckin' with the best y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Santana, know you fuckin' with the best y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Coke Boys, know you fuckin' with the best y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Dipset, bitch you fuckin' with the best y'all
You might also like
Everybody claim they a real one
Everybody ballin' 'til the bill come
Everybody blood 'til it's time to spill some
Bitches love Paris so I take 'em to the Hilton
Yes y'all, I stay fresh y'all
Life's a chess board, but for this dough I play Connect 4
Check after check I collect, tryna collect more
And for a check you get checked off
Life's cheap, don't get bought
Life's a bitch, money's an escort
Import, export, tailor made, cut from the best cloth
Balmain on, niggas more than flexed us
Santana back to pick up where I left off
Y'all niggas know me
I was the best before the best was
And now I'm back for what they owe me
Lil boy fresh all grown up
Pot clickin' still turning' the stove up, yup
Lil nigga still dripped in gold
Thousand gram kilos like I'm dipped in coke

Fuck school, I ain't like it
My mother said she want more from me
Not going, she said that you're a pure dummy
Instead I'm trafficking in traffic out in cross country
Dear mama your son turned to a floss junky
So I stepped into the ballpark
Coke, I franchised like Walmart
Sold it to the law, lawyers, judges, and mall cops
Got it any occassion, nigga I'm Hallmark
So yes y'all, yes yes y'all
No need to guess, I'm flee, that's fresh y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Montana, know you fuckin' with the best y'all
I said yes y'all, yes yes y'all
Santana, know you fuckin' with the best y'allEmbed
