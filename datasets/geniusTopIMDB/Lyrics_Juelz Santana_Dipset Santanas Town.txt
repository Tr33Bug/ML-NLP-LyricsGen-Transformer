Yo, I be with a gang of gangs, that hang and bang

A ho selection of my ho collection
And I'm big pimpin', stick givin', quick shiftin'

And I'm dangerous yeah, brainless yeah, stainless yeah
Aim to kill yeah, bangers yeah
Y'all some dead motherfuckers (oww!)
And my diddy-bop, barge through the city blocks
Hard with the pretty Glock, dodge or you gettin' shot
Diddy to the bar, hard liquor get a shot
Get a broad, get here hot, get her home give her cock (oww!)
Go, it's your birthday
Go, go drink it girl, it's cummin', I know you're thirsty (oww!)

Doomsday, goonsday, Tuesday to Thursday, ay (oww!)

That's why I scored your daughter, left her home, call her, call her
I'm in the low BM, yeah, with your old BM
Weed smoke and Ozium, trojans and petroleums
Yeah, and that's just incase the ho ain't safe
Take it off, bend it over, throw it in, work it, work it
Oops, squirt it, squirt
Oops, oopsy dais, ohh I'm crazed

I'm old school like Bambaataa, no man's hotta
The damn dadda, I jam proper, your man's nada
