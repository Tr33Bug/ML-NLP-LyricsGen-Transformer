Drake Voice Lyrics
I got jewels just like Santana
I got jewels just like Santana
I got jewels just like Santana
I got jewels just like Santana
I got jewels just like Santana

Feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
Feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
Feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
Feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hanging out the Phantom
Oh wait, who the fuck I think I'm fooling
I just feel like my damn self
Call Jahlil up
Told 'em sample Drake Voice, make that my anthem
I'm Hype Williams with a handheld
Bobby Brown with a handscale
Y'all niggas on a treadmill
Just runnin' at a stand still
I'm that motherfucking nigga homie, that's just something that I can't help
All these sucker MC's, that's just something that I can't feel
Was I with your bitch last night, that's just something that I can't tell
Gotta fuck with niggas doing better
Can't fuck with niggas doing lesser
All these fake niggas doing extra
'Til you put them underneath some pressure
It's like niggas in a rat race, they tryna see who can tell the fastest
Tell 'em niggas go that way, that or they momma picking out caskets
I done gave so much help out
Niggas don't appreciate shit
So it's time to help myself out
These niggas always gon' forget
It's 2017 nigga everbody giddy up, all bets took
Triple double on these niggas every night got me feeling like Westbrook
Got the basics on 'em like a textbook
Getting to the money, smoking best kush
I ain't worried 'bout none of you niggas
I'm just worried 'bout how my checks look
My new bitch she the baddest so I ain't worried 'bout how my ex look
But I've seen a picture of that bitch
And she got that "my life's a mess" look
All these fucking Twitter threats, you gon' kill this you gon' injure that
Like the police ain't got the internet
Man, real niggas ain't into that
When it's real nigga we getting into that
No chitter chat, we come through
Hate shit you still talking, we spinning back getting rid of that
Niggas better chill, life cheap on the block
Where we from we see a lot
Niggas get popped tryna be who they not
Niggas don't know how to dress
No stylist I be all kinda fresh
I'm a big fiend for Amaury jeans cause they fit good and the pockets stretch
Big wad and the small tool on me, yeah nigga that's my pocket wrench
Leap frog, I hopped the fence
Like you ain't got no fucking common sense
And I'ma start busting on your ass like I ain't got no fucking kinda sense
Aw man, they ain't ready for me
Aw man, they ain't ready for me
Probably got your bitch somewhere butt naked 'bout to get ready for me
Had to cut a lot of niggas off but I realize they was never for me
You tryna get that right now paper, I'm tryna get that forever money
Just a nigga with a attitude, tryna get that Jerry Heller money
I'm ruthless in the booth bitch
Ice on, lights on, I'm too lit
Car, cool whip and the roof lift
Forgiatos offset it
Bowlegged how the coupe sit
Here that boy go stunting again, yeah I'm back on my bullshit
