D’s Up Lyrics
You know what I'm saying
Rich nigga shit
It's the only way to go
Woo!
Hey!

Foreign (foreign), Bugatti's (yea)
Dirty pistol havin' bodies (brrt)
Don't know what it cost I just buy it (how much?)
She a whole 'nother bitch on the molly (woo)
Havin' them racks, I been havin' them racks (racks)
Young nigga playin' monopoly (monopoly)
The devil keep tryna jump all on my back
But I'm the man, ain't stoppin' me (nah)
Fuckin' that bitch, she got too attached
She won't get a call or text from me (brr)
These niggas takin' my recipe (recipe)
Money on the  right and the left of me (racks)
Gossippin' just like a bitch my nigga (gossip)
I'm in the trap cookin' fish my nigga (trap)
You poppin' so fuck it let's hit my nigga (hit)
Surrounded by dawgs, they pits my nigga (errr)
I'm stayin' away from the lames and thotties, I'm bout to get me a profit (profit)
I'm swervin' the lanes, my engines is 'Rari, 488 a 'Rari
Excuse me pardon, colorful diamonds like I been playin' sorry (sorry)
Look at my bitch she a barbie (barbie)
Double cup sippin' on bar (mud, drank, drank)
Gotta survive, the coolant it come with the TEC (brrt)
Run up your check, then you go buy a Patek (run up a check, hey)
Watery diamond, drippin' splash, wet (drip, splash, splash)
We got them choppers on deck when we boardin' them jets (aye)
I can not fuck up the reup, coco, ski up
Yeah, I got high paid shooters (high paid)
I'm tellin' them niggas to D up (D up)
Drop off, hardball
Grandpa got a sawed-off (grandpa)
Can't no work be stepped on (nah)
None of my niggas gon' fall off
Jumpin' out the trees with the ski's (with them ski's yeah)
Pull up on the plug with the fees (with them fees yeah)
Make her pop a perky on her knees (on her knees yeah)
I hook-shot that pot like Kareem (hook-shot)

Championship on my ring
I make my bitches trap out of Céline
I put that ice in my watch, Mr. Freeze
And I'm takin' the PJ just to go to Belize
I need that big gun, I'm talkin' machine
These pussy niggas just blowin' out steam
I get it lit 500 degrees
Chopper hit everything, bada boom bada bing
Beat the pot with the stamina (beat it)
Fucking your bitches on cameras (smash)
I got a bag of that Pamela
Put it right in the trunk of my tarantula
That's a spider for you dumb fucks
Money comin' by the dump trucks
Bodies lay by the dumpsters
It's real mobsters amongst us
Knots, trap out the bando it's hot
Fuck it invade the spot (spot)
Wrist watch, I put the wrist in the pot (pot)
I had to seize the lot
Tick tock, bitch still on the clock now go get that money for daddy
Whip rocks, soon as my work hit the block fiends line up for the package
I need that money, give me the loot
Play with my money, how silly is you?
I go to the dealer, I pick and I choose
I look like Mister T with all my jewels
If you try take it, I pity the fool
I take your honey, you Winnie the Pooh
My niggas got sticks that's bigger than you
Can't swim with the sharks, then stay in the pool
You might also like
I can not fuck up the reup, coco, ski up
Yeah, I got high paid shooters (high paid)
I'm tellin' them niggas to D up (D up)
Drop off, hardball
Grandpa got a sawed-off (grandpa)
Can't no work be stepped on (nah)
None of my niggas gon' fall off
Jumpin' out the trees with the ski's (with them ski's yeah)
Pull up on the plug with the fees (with them fees yeah)
Make her pop a perky on her knees (on her knees yeah)
I hook-shot that pot like Kareem (hook-shot)

I was hanging with the dealers then
Still hanging with the dealers now
They know I just signed a deal, so they ask how I'm feelin' now
I still run around and them phone calls
Pull up, pull the ceiling down (Skrt skrt)
I bought the crib in Miami though, had to drop a quarter million now
So, what really talkin' 'bout and New York bring Porsches out
I be thinkin' the days, that I was stuck in trail 'til the judge had to toss out it
Summertime bring Forces out
No socks, with the powder in 'em
Got my jewels on and my tank-top, big blunts with the loud up in 'em
Skinny bells with the locks on it
Soft top with the top on it
Master piece with the rocks on it
Big broom with a mop on it
Extendo clip, put a Glock on it (graow)
Hotbox, got the cops on me (woo)
Good dope, put a sock on it (dope)
Try the gang, get popped on it (gang)
I can not fuck up the reup, coco, ski up
Yeah, I got high paid shooters (high paid)
I'm tellin' them niggas to D up (D up)
Drop off, hardball
Grandpa got a sawed-off (grandpa)
Can't no work be stepped on (nah)
None of my niggas gon' fall off
Jumpin' out the trees with the ski's (with them ski's yeah)
Pull up on the plug with the fees (with them fees yeah)
Make her pop a perky on her knees (on her knees yeah)
I hook-shot that pot like Kareem (hook-shot)7Embed
