Letâ€™s Go (From Me to U) Lyrics
I've been really trying baby
Trying to hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
C'mon ohhhh, c'mon woo
Let's get it on

Let's get it on nigga

Aww man, let's get it on, man
Santana you on ya own, man
Hold the set down
We can get it on
Let's do it man, Dipset
We got these bastards man, let's do it
Uh, you niggas dealing with a G from the block
Yeah it's me from the block
Quick to tell a nigga let's get it on
But I don't really like to beef on the block
That brings heat to the block
I got to eat on the block, nigga
Yeah, you dealing with a pimp from the hood
Keep a chick from the hood
Quick to tell her, ay let's get it on
Come on, let's go
I'm trying to do it so, ay let's get it on
I'm one hell of a guy
Fly pelican fly
Like Scarface, one hell of a high, shit
One hell of a ride that I drive
23's look like propellers on side
Who stunting like me?
Who fronting like me?
Who did it? Who get it?
Who done it like me? You?
Who wishing? Who fronting? Who want it from me? You?
Come get it, you want it, it's nothing to me
And you, chumps already know how I feel
When it comes to the pump and the steel
It's like, let's get it on
You might also like
You know what these wild boys tote
Tie em up with the cowboy ropes
So let's get it on
Hey ma, back that ass up
Looking back  almost crashed up
So let's get it on

Man, you dudes can get it
That's my word to the slant on my Houston fitted
I send rockets at you dudes and midgets
Send cock up in you goose and pigeons
So let's get it on
I know you like that mama
I'll be right back mama
So let's get it on
Yeah, do you believe me?
Don't you believe me?
Won't you believe me?
Come, let's get it on
On any given Sunday or any given Monday
We headed up the runway
Uptown, yeah we headed up a one-way
Her head is in my lap
So I let her do her one thing
She was Jamaican, so I fed her bread and dumplings
Veggie pads and rum cake
Told her, let's get it on
Said she's 18 and lived crazy just like me
'80s baby just like me, so, let's get it on
Hey baby you know what your boy holds
All night, long pipe, long strokes:let's get it on
Hey ma, roll with the winners
And I ain't talking dinner
I'm like, let's get it on

Man I roll through, stroll through
Flag on the ride side of my whole crew
Screaming, let's get it on
They'll get you, they'll twist you
They'll split your whole body in half, then dismiss you
Like, let's get it on
But I'm looking for a bad lil mama
Get mad like her papa, got an ass like her mama
Got her own, won't ask for a dollar
Go half on a scama and I laugh when I holla, let's get it on

Hey baby, the ride on this chrome
Just provide us with dome, so let's get it on
You must be used to me spending
Hey ma if you give good brain, you'll get your Dipset chain
Lights out, nothing to fight 'bout
Got the pipe out, so let's get it on
(It's the only thing to do, I mean it's only right)1Embed
