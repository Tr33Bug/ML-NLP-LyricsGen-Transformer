Mixing Up the Medicine Lyrics
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
Santana's in the basement mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail
(Yo Juelz what it is?)
I've been mixing up the medicine
(Your game's looking sick)
I'm deliverin' the medicine
I been in the lab like a chemist: just developin'
My potion, now it's potent, time to hit em in the head again
Knock knock, pow pow, it's Santana let him in
I got what you need, tell a friend to tell a friend
If a label need a hit, if a fiend need a fix
Or if a chick just need some good dick, I got the (medicine)
You boys shipping whack drops
Y'all should be mascots
Come and see the splash doc
I'll give you a swag shot
Fuck what you hearin, you should listen
This is rap penicillin
Still in the kitchen (mixing, mixing medicine)
Young splash and I'm back in the building
Swagger on a hundred, thousand, trillion
Whatever he said times that by gazillion
And thats only half of how I'm feeling
I been (mixing up the medicine)

Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail

Lights camera action, I'm feeling fantastic
Flyer than a pair of wings flappin
Take my picture
You a freak, I'm a freak
You going home, take me with ya
I'll look at your baby pictures
But I won't have no baby with ya
Back up or ya heard me
Back up or ya head me
I'm ballin like the 80s, so James Worthy
Still makin money off the white girl, Fergie
I ain't a new boy so they know they can't jerk me
No limit how I get it, call me Percy
Miller, I'm a killer, no mercy
And I'm so dope you'd think Frank Lucas served me
So hot fire couldn't burn me
Bitches wanna nurse me
Take her out and trick around
I take her home and dick her down
Send her back to you like
"Baby I was at my sisters house"
Y'all nigga remember me
I'm every rappers enemy
Cuz they know once I get the lead
You'll never get ahead of me

Swagger on rooftops
And One's, new Glock
You wanna get loud you'll get blastedâ€”boombox
Attitude like 2Pac when Juice dropped
Still go to the dealer with the money in a shoe box
This wasn't supposed to come out
This wasn't supposed to come out
They let that new drug out
They let that new drug out
My niggas 'bout to dumb out
My ladies 'bout to bug out
And if her body crazy, I'm a take her to the nut house
You lames ain't interesting
The games been missing this
Nigga's full of sugar and I came with the insulin
Whatever's your addiction
I got your prescription
I get it how I live it
And I'm loving every minute
You got that shit that just came out: that new new
I got that shit that ain't came out: it's too new
I'm so intriguing, you're girl's so deceiving
I'm so exciting, and she's so conniving1Embed
