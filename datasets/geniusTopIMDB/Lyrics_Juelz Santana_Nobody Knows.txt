Nobody Knows Lyrics
Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; they don’t know what I’m going through

They don’t understand what I’ve been through
They don’t understand what I go through
You think everything’s all good but you only see what I show you
They don’t understand that boss life, gotta take care of my whole crew
(My whole crew, my whole crew) they depend on me my fuckin niggas
They know the love is real and I’m a fuckin winner
We all gon' eat, Sunday dinner
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
They hate it when you up, they love it when you down
All we got is us then told my niggas look around
Look around, look around
If I gotta be the one to lift us up, I won’t let em down
So at the top it’s just us looking down
Sorry I delayed us, but we gon' get this paper
Had a couple issues, I dealt with them, now it’s payback
Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; they don’t know what I’m going through

It’s like everybody got they hand out
Actin' like they you owe 'em something
They expect you to throw em something
When they really need you to show 'em something
One month, you're broke again
Actin' like you ain’t throw em none
Ungrateful ass niggas, they only love you when you giving
And the day you say you ain’t got it, they forget the days that you did it
You forgot me when I was losin', so forget me when I’m winnin'
Where the dark day was frenzing me 'til the day they be friended me
One day we broke friends, next day we rich enemies
It’s hard being a real nigga, when these niggas got bitch tendencies
Female emotions, I can’t waste my energy
For them I got that remedy, kill 'em with success
Royalty is my pedigree, too fresh to be stressed
But thank god for memories, god willin I’m blessed
My comeback’s they penalty, these haters gon' be upset
And I done lost a couple friends on the way
Fuck 'em they wasn’t really with me all the way - I’ll be okay

Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They can't understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; don’t know what I’m going through2Embed
