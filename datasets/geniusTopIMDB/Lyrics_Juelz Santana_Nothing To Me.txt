Nothing To Me Lyrics
Uh, aight, aight, aight
Aight, aight, aight, WOOOO...

H-H-H-Hold up, hold up
Bad bitches, pour up
Money low, no sir
I just thr-throw it up, thr-throw it up
You see me blowing all this cash, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
Money flying like it got wings, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
I see them niggas over there hating, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
Got my niggas with me I'm straight, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
WOOOOO, aight
Showin' money (yea), blowin' money (yea), throwin' money, you see us (yea)
And if not your bitch do, she ditched you to come see us (us)
Now she wanna chill with us (yea) bust it open for a real nigga
D.O.A., we shoot money - yeah nigga, we kill strippers (woooo)
I don't care if that ass fake, long as that ass shake
All this money and diamonds on me, now that's what I call carrot cake (uh)
Gotta keep up by speed up, going hard til my last day
I'm balling on 'em, fast break, fast life, no back brakes
Swerve, I know I get on they fucking nerves (skirrrt)
That's your bitch? I'm leaving with her, word
You front with money, I do what I want with money
My new whip, that's one thousand bricks cause that shit cost me a ton of money
In here, they panickin', them broke boys can't handle it
These boys ain't got swag, they just bought what's on a manikin
Hold up, hold up, hold up, wait - time to let 'em know who's the man again (me)
New Rolly', sky dweller, fifty grand on my hand again

H-H-H-Hold up, hold up
Bad bitches, pour up
Money low, no sir
I just thr-throw it up, thr-throw it up
You see me blowing all this cash, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
Money flying like it got wings, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
I see them niggas over there hating, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
Got my niggas with me I'm straight, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me

Who's house? My house, who's house? My house
Ball so hard, need a time out, y'all ain't balling, lock out
Bad bitches, they chop out, bounce bitch, don't stop now
Pussy look like Pacquiao and I'm Marquez, that knock out

Hey, that money I'mma throw
I mean jackpot, I wanna see her low
I been up at the top, they ain't seen that before
I really don't stop, all I know is go
That Beamer riding low, that Forgiato lift
Here won't you take a shot, now won't you take a trip
I see his bleeding, I know you're so conceded
Acting like you don't, and you know you know you need it

H-H-H-Hold up, hold up
Bad bitches, pour up
Money low, no sir
I just thr-throw it up, thr-throw it up
You see me blowing all this cash, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
Money flying like it got wings, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
I see them niggas over there hating, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to me
Got my niggas with me I'm straight, that don't mean nothing to me
That don't mean nothing to me, that don't mean nothing to meEmbed
