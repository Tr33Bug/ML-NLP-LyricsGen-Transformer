Okay, Okay Lyrics
Yeah, Juelz Santana (okay!)
Heatmakerz (that shit them niggas did ain't affectin' nobody man!)
That animal music man
Let's do it

OHH! It's the brand new prince of the city, man
Thanks to Killa, my nigga, yes he with me, fam
Y'all know what we about to do
Roll out, we about to move (OKAY!)
I make music I consider a challenge
Like this here, reminds me of Gilligan's Island
And that reminds of Harlem, where my niggas is whylin
The only borough that was built on an island (OHH!)
You fucks probably ain't know, if they cut off the bridges
We'd be stuck, forced to live on the Island (WHOA!)
But we gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Niggas still want beef then holla
You think you bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
A young {*Muhammad Atta*}, no plane lessons
Cocaine lessons, to supply the towers, OH!
Before they crashed and divided the towers
I'm hurtin, working hard to reprovide the towers, like
Bring 'em back up, lift 'em back up
Niggas back up, or lift his back up (WHAT!)
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
Y'all can't fuck with me, OKAY!
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!
Y'all can't fuck with me, OKAY!

Now let me hear you say (OKAY!)
It's Santana the great again
Tie him up, bandana his face again
I tried to tell 'em it's no escaping the basics
And no escaping the hatred and no escaping The Matrix, man
Only Neo is me, no Cleo can see my future
If she did I'd shoot her
They tried to say the mission was impossible
I came through, crew did it, got it poppin too
Two bitches on my side both prostitutes
Gray smoke, mobster's suit, yeah they get it poppin too (nigga)
I get my ace holes chopped in two, dimes, quarters, rocks in two
The fiends cop it too (OKAY!)
Yeah, look at 'em rockin two, rockin boat, Rock n' Jock
Stop and plot, hot a BLDAT
Fucka, this nigga gotta stop, out of sight, out of mind
Gotta go, he out of line (OHH!)
