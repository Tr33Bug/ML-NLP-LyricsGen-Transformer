Santana Bandana Lyrics
You all see this?
I’m just trying to make it, until we make it
I’m not trying fucking to do a million dollars
Uhh I mean, I’ll take it you know what i mean?
Don’t get it twisted, but
I’m not 24 hours pumping out
Niggas would really be getting money over there boom boom
Whatever comes, comes know i'm saying? Period
Whatever comes by me comes by me
I will deal with that and do it
I ain't busting my neck full fledge hustling that don’t even work out
My nigga I’m telling you, shit don’t work out
Man we done did, you don’t think we ain’t who we are we ain’t hustle
We older than you my nigga we know what that shit is about
Shit ain’t that little man you gotta make sure you pay your bills
If you got a shot at something real, that is the shot! (That’s right)
Santana
Santana Back, he got the bandana back
Santana back, he got the bandana back

That is a fact that is a Fendi, Santana back its a wrap its a rizzy (Ooh)
I keep the strap yeah the strizzy, could be the mac or the dilly
The 9 only come out to shoot, my Shy Glizzy
Any given day might have a brick stashed in the stizzy
Deebo back to Z-Bo'in niggas, been on my grizzly
Leg hanging out the Phantom you heard drizzy (I feel like Juelz Santana, leg hanging out the Phan-)
Bumpin' "Litty" again, word to Meek Milly
'Till they kill me or come get me
Still balling, what up Jimmy? Been rich just trying to get filthy
All my whips foreign and the color’s milky
Teachers used to tell the other kids not to fuck with me (Why?)
He’s a dummy he’s bad company
Now my teachers kids looking up to me, same teacher texting me like do you want some company?
She let me fuck her brains out, now how dumb is she? (Ha)
You know i hit it and quit it, on a mission to get it, this life i’m living is forbidden
So I stay gripping and wit it, get caught slipping you finished
Gotta watch these niggas 'cuz they switching like bitches
With this piece i’m like a barber with clippers, all these carnival niggas
Stick to the business only honorable niggas
Yeah there is only respect violence gotta harm a few niggas
Gotta play dumb sometimes just to be smarter than niggas
We was set up to fail from the beginning niggas go to school just to get stuck paying tuition
Drug game different niggas pieces ain't hitting
Let the gram tell it though, everybody winning
These boys don’t listen, they don’t respect tradition
Niggas start shit, get bombed on and start snitching
Cops kill a nigga, get aquitted in a minute
And they try to bribe vision, and make us think the murderer’s the victim
And slaves to the system, it’s just the world we live in
