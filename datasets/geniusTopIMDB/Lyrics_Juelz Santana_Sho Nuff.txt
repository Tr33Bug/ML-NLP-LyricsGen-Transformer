Sho'nuff: Am I the meanest?
Goons: Sho'nuff!
Sho'nuff: Am I the prettiest?
Goons: Sho'nuff!
Sho'nuff: Am I the baddest mofo low down around this town?
Goons: Sho'nuff!
Sho'nuff: Well who am I?
Goons: Sho'nuff!
Sho'nuff: Who am I?
Goons: Sho'nuff!
Sho'nuff: I can't hear you...
Goons: Sho'nuff!

Y'all niggas know)
Sho'nuff: the Shogun, I can't hear you...
Goons: Sho'nuff!
Am I gettin' money? (Sho nuff)
Am I the meanest? (Sho nuff)
Am I the baddest? (Sho nuff)
Am I the flyest? (Sho nuff)
Bitch, who got the illest mojo fo sho 'round this town?
Me (Sho nuff) uhh
Yeah I walk that walk, yeah I talk that talk
I'm from grimy ass New York (PREACH!)

Uh, my neck was only built for Cuban links
Diamond chains, the finer things, you know
My wrist was only made for APs
Rollies, what you know about Robert Debeau, hoe?
Bitch I'm paid
Bow when you see me, kiss my J's
Let a nigga try and lift my chain
And it's bye little birdie, I clip those wings (yeah)
You chase chickens, I flip those things
Fucked your baby momma
And I ain't even kick no game (nah, haha)
Pockets on cheesecake all day
Strawberry coke got shortcake
Sold many pounds, feel like I lost weight
Raw work, fiends can't keep they jaw straight
You could run, you could hide, you're not at all safe
Hope you got insurance, I be in all states

Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all
The .40 move everything around me, leaves niggas bloody
Lot of niggas gettin' killed y'all
Uh, my clique like the Knicks in my city
Shoot a nigga down, JR Smith in my city
They claimin' that they ‘bout that, I doubt that
Get smoked with the .40 cal loud-pack
Uh, I guess this is where the fun stops
Niggas all fake, bust shots
All my bitches ass fat, some butt shots
And if your chick with me she getting butt shots
Niggas gettin' weirder and weirder
Got me feelin' cooler and cooler
Versace belt buckle, big Medusa
I'm the past and the future (think about it)
Am I gettin' money? (Sho nuff)
Am I the meanest? (Sho nuff)
Am I the baddest? (Sho nuff)
Am I the flyest? (Sho nuff)
Bitch, who got the illest mojo fo sho 'round this town?
Me (Sho nuff) uhh
Yeah I walk that walk, yeah I talk that talk

La di da di, brand new Ferrari
Still got it on me, I can't trust nobody
I put on for my city, you a local clown
It's over now, I’m here
Don't call it a comeback, fuck it call it a comeback
And this right here is the grudge match
Muhammed Ali with the jab, these niggas throwin' love taps
Guess I gotta sting niggas to get my buzz back
B, do anything to get my cars back
Payback's always a must, nigga, trust that
My niggas bust, they don't bust back
My bitches bust and I bust back
Niggas get killed in the line of fire
Dealers go broke tryna ball like suppliers
They all goofballs
And they got fools gold jewels on

Am I gettin' money? (Sho nuff)
Am I the meanest? (Sho nuff)
Am I the baddest? (Sho nuff)
Am I the flyest? (Sho nuff)
Bitch, who got the illest mojo fo sho 'round this town?
Me (Sho nuff), uhh
Yeah I walk that walk, yeah I talk that talk
I'm from grimy ass New York (PREACH!)3Embed
