Soft Lyrics
They say I’m comin’ too hard, huh? (Chea-heh)
I say these niggas comin’ too soft (yeah)
All them niggas soft (yeah)
Niggas over there are soft (whoooo)
I sold that brick soft (HUH), this YSL, so soft (HUH)
My girl ass so soft (HUH), these Louis shoes so soft (HUH)
You ho niggas so soft (HUH), my AK for assaults (HUH)
I’m sippin’ this sauce, my dick won’t stay soft
My car seats so soft, these Heat Tags say “boss”
You ho niggas so soft, you ho niggas so soft
Soft, haha, whoooo...
My car seats so soft (soft), your army so soft (soft)
Real nigga and she like me ‘cause I make sure she get off
These niggas claimin’ they winnin’ but when I’m around they lost (lost)
I’m in a new car, four door (yep), double R, logo  (yep)
Big rims, no spokes, small tires, low-pro (ahhh)
You pussies know that I’m no joke (uh-uh), how you want it? 4-O? (uh)
Four four for cinco, no ocho, just BLOW-BLOW~!!
Still duckin’ the po-po, I make her come back like a yo-yo
I’m like Ice-T with that white girl, still gettin’ money off Coco (haha)
Still flyer than all y’all, shit tell me somethin’ I don’t know
Got a bad bitch bouncin’ on my stick like a pogo, screamin’ YOLO
My diamonds be shinin’, like a snow cone, I’m so froze
Far as that dough goes I’m Russell Simmons, you JoJo
My type get real cash, your type get killed fast
Y’all niggas like soft booty - Get it? Real ass
You ho niggas so soft, why don’t you hoe niggas get lost?
I’ll pay to see you gone, how much you hoe niggas gon’ cost?

I sold that brick soft (HUH), this YSL, so soft (HUH)
My girl ass so soft (HUH), these Louis shoes so soft (HUH)
You ho niggas so soft (HUH), my AK for assaults (HUH)
I’m sippin’ this sauce, my dick won’t stay soft
My car seats so soft, these Heat Tags say “boss”
You ho niggas so soft, you ho niggas so soft
I sold that brick soft (HUH), this YSL, so soft (HUH)
My girl ass so soft (HUH), these Louis shoes so soft (HUH)
You ho niggas so soft (HUH), my AK for assaults (HUH)
I’m sippin’ this sauce, my dick won’t stay soft
My car seats so soft, these Heat Tags say “boss”
You ho niggas so soft, you ho niggas so soft
I sold that brick soft (HUH), this YSL, so soft (HUH)
My girl ass so soft (HUH), these Louis shoes so soft (HUH)
You ho niggas so soft (HUH), my AK for assaults (HUH)
I’m sippin’ this sauce, my dick won’t stay soft
My car seats so soft, these Heat Tags say “boss”
You ho niggas so soft, you ho niggas so soft
You might also like
Man, you ho niggas so soft..
Right back in the hood, fresh off tour, jumpin’ out that new four-door
Bust down, AP Offshore, all this stuntin’ ain’t called for
None of these bitches ain’t all yours (nah), none of these niggas hardcore (nah)
Young fly nigga, I’m fresh, man; bad bitch with me at sophomore
My Rolex is like Mayweather’s, I make it rain like Mayweather
Ask them hoes at KOD - I don’t throw paper, I spray cheddar
Your whip mean? Mine way better, chicks they greet and love me
Up in the corner and hug me, go all these hoes tryin’ to fuck me
Cause that leather handle so soft (soft), all I know is go hard (hard)
High as fuck, I’m on Mars; my pockets on black card
Cause it ain’t no limit (ain’t no limit) to the shit I’m spendin’ (shit I’m spendin’)
It’s double-M-G (double-M-G), yeah nigga, we winnin' - HAH~!
I sold that brick soft (HUH), this YSL, so soft (HUH)
My girl ass so soft (HUH), these Louis shoes so soft (HUH)
You ho niggas so soft (HUH), my AK for assaults (HUH)
I’m sippin’ this sauce, my dick won’t stay soft
My car seats so soft, these Heat Tags say “boss”
You ho niggas so soft, you ho niggas so soft

Yeah, yeah, nice...
I’m in the hood with that white thing - Mister Softee
Tell them kids don’t run up - got it on me, now get ‘em off me
Get ‘em off me, get ‘em off me, before I make it hot like coffee
Just seen ‘em put a hole-in-one and I ain’t gon’ let ‘em golf me
Got a O-Z of that loudmouth (yeah), my smoke never speak softly (uh)
Ride on that dick flow, my bitch never go off-beat (whoo)
Only time that I’m off feet, known to stand on my own two
If you ‘round me, you gotta go hard - soft niggas I don’t do
These niggas ain’t family; if you was, I would’ve disowned you
And fucked bitches that won’t do (yeah), call a bitch who want to (yeah)
Gotta feel me, my texture (feel me), these dumb bitches too extra (feel me)
I just kicked this bitch up off the bus, had to “next” her (feel me)
I’m too strong in these streets, boy, please don’t make me flex up
You know nothin’ ‘bout this, I do this, I’m a expert
VVs go off, like the TVs in my loft
That’s HD on my HT, these ho niggas so soft…3Embed
