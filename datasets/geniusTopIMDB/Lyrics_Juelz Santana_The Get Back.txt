The Get Back Lyrics
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
In all we livin', just dream about the get

Saw my life slippin', bunch of minor setbacks
Now it's time to get it, focus on the get-back
Everything I lost, yeah, it's time to get back
Niggas wasn't with me, won't be with me when I get back
Get-back, get-back, it's the fuckin' get-back
Niggas touched mine, you know I'ma get back, stress that
It's the fuckin' get-back, get-back
Nigga, it's time to get back, get
I need good vibes and no problems
Good trees, wherever we go, the hoes follow
Chinese for dinner, yeah, that was old problems
Pillow talkin' and switchin' up, that's a ho's problem
You-know-what, I'm talkin' 'bout that you-know-what
You know what we doin', nigga, you know what (Ayy)
You know what we doin', yeah, yeah, you know what (Ayy)
You-know-what, I'm talkin' 'bout that you-know-what

Real niggas on the rise
Fake niggas, we despise
Real niggas on the rise
Fake niggas, we despise (Ayy, uh, ayy)
Lil' boy fresh, all grown up (Yup)
Still got a trunk full of that you-know-what (Yup)
Still hit a nigga up with that you-know-what (Yup)
Just left your ho and gave her that you-know-what (Yup)
Can't let the fast money slow up (Nah)
Show off and show out every time I show up (Forever)
Yeah, hold the piece like a steady cam (Steady cam)
Young nigga ballin' hard, Jelly Fam (Yeah)
Whippin' so much, wish I had a extra hand (Woo)
Bad as MJ, so fly, I might never land (Never)
Young niggas winnin', that's they only fear (Only fear)
They gave Bobby and them boys like a hundred years (Damn)
These days we just free slaves, yeah
Programmed to think things change (Ayy)
Prayin' for my niggas that got court today ('Day)
I got it on me, pray I don't get caught today (Woo)
