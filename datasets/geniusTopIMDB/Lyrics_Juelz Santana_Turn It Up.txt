Turn It Up Lyrics
Somebody tell the DJ to turn it up
Somebody tell the DJ to turn it up {Automatik}

Now I see why they hating, my diamonds Harlem's shaking
All the bad bitches I'm taking, if they hot, then I'm blazin'
My nickname should be Benjamin, cause I stay with them Franklin's
These niggas saying they balling, but look like they need a donation
They see me spend what they making, one night, they whole life savings
It's like every every day is a party, my life's a fucking vacation
And I don't know my neighbors cause my property is on acres
My safe look like Vegas, my blunts look like Jamaicans
Got my eyes looking like Asian's, look in my pots, Caucasian
Look under it and it's flaming, y'all niggas know what I'm baking
Bitch I be so far gone, On Star can't find my location
Go ahead try to pull my card nigga, all I'm holding is aces
Somebody tell the DJ to turn it up (turn it up)
Big face Rollie's all across the board
Call a fucking doctor, boy we acting dumb (we actin' dumb)
Foreign whip, half a ticket, now it's lit
Big racks in my pocket (my pocket), shawty on that molly (that molly)
Tell that bitch we rollin' (we rollin'), it is my party (my party)
It's, my, party, I get, fly, if I, want, to
It's, my, party, bitch, I do, what I, want, to

Uh, aiyo, I'm big whippin' foreign, sick zips, no hearin' (uhh)
Louie badge, no cuffs, statue lit, bitch I'm chilling (right)
He rush when I'm in the building, I'm crushing what I am wearing
They fussing like I am caring, I'm busting like a McLaren (uh)
They say I'm the life of the party (yeah), I came to pick out a target
This shit here, I'm on the hold list - phone list, shamballa
I get her going, she won't wanna leave (uh), by midnight, I'm on number three (uh)
They all know they ain't number one (uh), by ten, by twenty, they come to me (yeah)
Bring the lay's, no limit, money drop from the ceiling
I'm all the players in spirit, she voluneteered, no stealing
Hoes down, G's up (up), I'm foreign V-keyed up (up)
I'm drunk on grape, we stuck (stuck), I'm dumb good, don't need luck, uh
