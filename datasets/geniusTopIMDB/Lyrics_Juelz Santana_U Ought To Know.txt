U Ought To Know Lyrics
You should never argue with
A crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind
You oughta know by now (You oughta know by–)
You should never argue with
A crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind
Is that all you get for your money?
You should never argue with
A crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind (Uh)
You oughta know by now (You oughta know by–)
You ought know by now
Oh, you oughta know by now, man
You should never argue with
A crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind
Is that all you get for your money?
The , yeah
Now when the beats on, Santana gone ride out
Car still rollin', hop out, Glock out like
You should never argue with
A crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind
Then I shoot ya, hop back in the manoeuvre
The V off skiied off while I'm yellin' out
You oughta know by now
Don't make me spell it out
I'll push ya melon out
Then get back to the block
The packies that rock baggies and tops uh
Shit I'll slap it or not?
Fuck it man
Is that all you get for your money?
Thats what I tell em' man
I'm a selfish man
I need every grand
Is that all you get for your money?
Once again uh
Not a penny more
Not anymore I'll let this
Semi poor shots in your memory core
(You should never argue
Wit a crazy mi mi mi mi mind)
I thought I told you before
Now show 'em the four
(Is that all you get for your money?
You ought-a know by now)
(ought-a know by)
You might also like

Hey yo I'm goin to town
Blowin' it down smokin a pound Now
(You ought-a know by now)
That the kid is just hungry
Give up a twenty Now
(Is that all you get for your money?)
Fifty mil I feel is
Reachin my quota
Any beef n its over
I'm real subtle
Put bleach in ya soda
So dont make me have to put your teeth in your shoulder
Doped up dope feen fell asleep in the cobra
(You should never argue
Wit a crazy mi mi mi mi mind
You ought-a know by now
Is that all you get for your money?)
Big jewels and they iced out
Nice trucks Big rims piped out
I see the wife out she hoped in
I hoped and then hoped right now
Thats what my life 'bout
I get head with the lights on, lights out
I used to drop Lewinsky off at the White House

Come check out your boy
Still poppin', still rockin', still watchin'
(You ought-a know by now)
I still got it, yeah
Still grindin', still pitchin' that Phyllis Hyman
(Its that how we get to your money)
I ain’t lyin', nope
Still on my pimp shit, still on my dip shit, yeah
You dipshits is still on my hit list
Still play lotto, win fast, still on my quick pic, yeah
Still tryin to get rich quick, yeah

I’m still tryin to hit chicks with stiff dick
(You ought-a know by now )
I’m ‘bout big chips, yes true grandma
This is the zoo, i’m the zoo keeper, he zoolander
Apes, wolfes, gorillas, a few pandas
Got two hammers coming to shoot grandma
(You should never argue with a crazy mi mi mi mi mind)
We the crazy motherfuckers, three-eighty years daisy, motherfucker
