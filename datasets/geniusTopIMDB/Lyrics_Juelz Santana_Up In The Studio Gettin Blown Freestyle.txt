Up In The Studio Gettin Blown (Freestyle) Lyrics
I'm just cut from a different cloth
And they don't make this fabric no more
That money coming, I'm grabbin' it all
Triple beam leaning, still balancing raw
Still got the white, Macklemore
Car seat smelling like I just ripped the packing off
Run down on me in traffic, I'm backin' 'em off
Sex, money and murder, mastered it all
Shout out to my macs but I'm Billy though
Still on that gangland shit, really though
Got a couple locs that I'm close with
And they'll Shmurda dance on your whole shit
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Free Duski, free Chewie, free my old Y's
Act up, we at your neck like bowties
Belly shit, bringing niggas gifts in a whole 9
Might send your woman crush on a road trip
That pussy stuffed with a whole brick
She don't smoke weed but she blow dick
She don't smoke weed but she blow dick
Buy it by the pounds, smoking by the zip
Buy 'em by the rounds, shoot 'em by the clip
Everybody down, everybody hit
I said everybody down, everybody hit
Nowadays the game full of lames and straight gays
Niggas throwing shade and hate from a fake page
Niggas catfishing for asswhippings
Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit 'em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death, blood on this Raf Simons

Fiends like 'Santana, where you at with it'
Back like cooked crack, y'all done gave too many bad fixes
Looking at my Rollie it's bout that time, yo
Extended clip have your whip jumping like pot holes
Yeah, I'm the main event you the side show
Time's up, mine go (hit 'em with the Young MA flow)
I think these niggas think I lost my mojo
No, I think it's time I let these niggas know so
They can't fuck with me and they know so
I'm out here rocking Gucci like it's Polo
Stil drippin' sauce, that's that Mojo
They know I got that spice that Adobo
And I'm still selling coke tho
Let me stop, you niggas cops, Robo
My nigga Black an animal, stay on go mode
Bounce keep the tre cinco ocho
Chewie coming home, they like 'oh no'
Cause they know how he playing with that .45
Ain't talkin’ weed when I tell my niggas blow smoke
Ain't talkin’ rain when I say you'll get your clothes soaked
Watch my name when you rap, might get your throat choke
Might tell your bitch to come over get these slow pokes
She gon’ get each and every one of her holes poked
Lil Yachty in that pussy, I got that row boat
Yeah, back on the heels again
Born to lose, build to win
Y'all niggas know now
You might also like

Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit 'em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death, blood on this Raf Simons4Embed
