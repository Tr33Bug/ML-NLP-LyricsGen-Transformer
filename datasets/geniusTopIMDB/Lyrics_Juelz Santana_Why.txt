Why Lyrics
Damn, shit (why)
It's like the beat is just asking me why (why)
Why I'm rapping to y'all
Listen (come on)

My name mean a lot to me, pain mean a lot to me
Fame means nothing, but the game means a lot to me
I slang 'caine on these blocks for weeks
Ever since Rocky III, and the death of Apollo Creed
I was a tiny little poppy seed
As grimy as I could be, as shiesty as I could be
Niggas who live nicely, who don't understand the life of me
Other niggas don't like me, and wanna take my life from me
They don't understand that I love it, and I like the beef
The raw, the guns, the violence, it's all right with me
I be laying in the cut where the sniper be
Righteously, waiting for you to get out the driver's seat
(Damn) damn, it's crazy man, I don't think like usual people
Who think like usual people, who don't think right
I think like Muslims, in movements of people, who move they people, and move on your people
Power is stronger than voo doo and evil
I'm immune, I drunk the juice, took a root from the needle
Still trying to figure out, why I do, the crimes I do
With the minds IQ, of an Einstein too
Tell 'em, Cha-cha, and ba-fan-goo
They think I'm crazy, well I do too
Leave me alone please, I'm in my two-three zone please
Nothing can stop me, you fuckers can't stop me... it's crazy
Why, why, why, whyyyy
Why, why, why, whyyyy

It's like my life keeps turning around
Every second I need a lighter, I keep burning it down
I smoke so much, I could nurture a pound
My thoughts is always foggy, they blurring right now
Listen (listen), I told you.. (told you man)
I see the game for what it's worth, pain, fame and work
Girls walk with they brain in their skirt
So while you fucking, they thinking
Of ways to get even, or a way out the hood, they make up a reason
For the judge, for you take him and see him
Until you face a subpoena, that'll change your demeanor
So be careful, where you skating through this game
Remember it's other niggas playing, skating in your lane
Don't get clipped, or slip skating in the rain
Cause niggas will keep rolling, and skating on your brain
That's just the rules and regulations of the game
When you playing you, you playing
And you paying like you weigh in, so.. told you again (listen)
If not, those wolves aiming where you laying
And waiting on you patient with that thing up in the basement
That's why I walk with that thing out, when I'm pasting
Cause I know these niggas hate it, that their little sisters love it
And their girls really want it, plus I'm fronting
Twenty three big trucking, new Z, new bucket
Fuck it (fuck it, I don't know why, listen)
(Stop asking, stop asking)
