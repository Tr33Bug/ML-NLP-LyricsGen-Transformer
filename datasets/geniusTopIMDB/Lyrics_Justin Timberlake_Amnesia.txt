Amnesia Lyrics
Keeps coming closer
I don‘t, but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type
Amnesia, that’s over
I can see your breathing, girl, is colder
I can see you need me but I don’t care
My whole memory of me and love
Gone so far from me, girl
It’s not fair
I could feel it almost start to change (Almost start to change)
But then it hurts too much
That’s when it starts to fade
So cold, baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you'd leave me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?
Don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No "we" anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know

Now, these photos of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened
Who are they? Where did they go?
And when was enough enough?
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love's gone so far from me, It's not fair
And I can feel it almost start to change (Almost start to change)
But it just hurts too much, I let it go away

So cold, baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you'd leave me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?
Don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No "we" anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know
I can feel it almost start to change (Almost start to change)
But then it hurts too much, I let it go away, uuuh

So cold, baby (So cold), now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you'd leave me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?
Don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything to nothing
No "we" anymore, she’s a stranger
Amnesia, every memory fades away 'til it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything to nothing
No "we" anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know
And I don’t know you anymore
Everything to nothing
Everything to nothing
She’s a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

Go on and tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot
Who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fucking amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind of fucking amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot who we are
I’ll let you drive me crazy for another day
Isn’t this love insane, insane? Yeah13Embed
