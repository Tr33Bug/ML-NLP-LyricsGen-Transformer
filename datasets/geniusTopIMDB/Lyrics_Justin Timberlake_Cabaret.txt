Cabaret Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, come on
We're havin' too much fun right here, uh

She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low?
'Cause you already dropped the bullet, turned it into somethin' major

Now, can we discuss how fast you just got undressed?
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first (And)
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close
It's a cabaret, oh, oh (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret, oh, oh (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more, oh, oh
(Put on a show, get on the floor) Ho, oh
(Get on the floor, get on the floor) Oh, oh
(Put on a show, get on the floor) Ho, oh
You're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

Fantasy, play the role
And all these new moves I like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know?
'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we're layin' in the Manger

Now, can we discuss how fast you just got undressed?
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first
And don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

It's a cabaret, oh, oh (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret, oh, oh (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor) Ho, oh
(Get on the floor, get on the floor) Oh, oh
(Put on a show, get on the floor) Ho, oh
You're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more

Okay, this just in, girl, the paper so long
Always seem like I gotta wait for so long
So long 'til you get off from work, but listen
I got some better positions for you to take in so long
Always strap up just for safety then go long
Then do my touchdown dance in it no clothes on
We might fuck around and slip tonight
You're Kryptonite, should probably have a cape to throw on
On my Eddie Murphy Boomerang for ya
Got a bunch of old girls that I threw away for ya
I been in the gym doing two-a-days for ya
So I can lift ya up when I do the thang to ya
D-do do the thing to ya, girl truth be told
You set the pace then you ride it like cruise control
The shit feel so right gotta tell somebody
I just can't decide who should know, I'll keep a secret for ya

I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom, that was there when I moved in

Okay fine, I'm a terrible liar
Girl, what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine?
You the girl that's gon' be there when it's marrying time
And I'ma fuck you like we havin' an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffin' you though
Presidential shit girl you up on the poles
Sayin' this a private show, oh, boy, don't start
Keep this whole stripper thing secret in a pole vault
North pole boy from the T.O
They ain't really ready for me and that J.T. though
Cook for ya and then I break it down like a kilo
Got a camera watching every single move like casinos
Cabaret, oh, oh (Put on a show, get on the floor)
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret, oh, oh (Put on a show, get on the floor)
You're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
(Get on the floor, get on the floor)
(Put on a show, get on the floor)
You're giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more30Embed
