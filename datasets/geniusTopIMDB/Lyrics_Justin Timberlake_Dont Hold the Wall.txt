Donâ€™t Hold the Wall Lyrics
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't-don't-don't hold the wall
Dance-dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

Come on the floor with them legs
It's gettin' down but I'll get up
'Cause I heard you tell your girlfriend
That "I deserve better"
Well, I think you look better
But you're so far, I had to go get ya
Take you to the light, it's dark in the back
You started movin', you put an arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink and you're getting closer to me
Dance in the light, startin' to see
You started moving, you're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go

So baby, hold on
Dance (Uh!), don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance, don't-don't-don't hold the wall
Baby, hold on
Dance-dance (Yeah), don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance-dance-dance, don't hold the wall
Dance (What you do to me)
Dance, don't-don't-don't hold the wall
Dance-dance (What you do to me)
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

Dance-dance, don't hold the wall
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall

I think I heard what you said
He's not what you thought and you're fed up
I heard your girlfriend tell you, you could do better
Well, I'm the best ever
But you're so far, I had to come get ya

Take you to the light, it's dark in the back
You started movin', you put an arch in your back
Closer to me, closer to me
Sippin' your drink and you're getting closer to me
Dance in the light, startin' to see
You started moving, you're getting closer to me
And now you won't even let me go

So baby, hold on
Dance (Uh!), don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance, don't-don't-don't hold the wall
Baby, hold on
Dance-dance (Yeah), don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance-dance-dance, don't hold the wall
Dance (What you do to me)
Dance, don't-don't-don't hold the wall
Dance-dance (What you do to me)
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't hold the wall
Dance, don't hold the wall


Baby, hold on
Dance, don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance, don't-don't-don't hold the wall
Baby, hold on
Dance-dance, don't hold the wall
Let go
Dance-dance-dance, don't hold the wall
Dance (What you do to me)
Dance, don't-don't-don't hold the wall
Dance-dance (What you do to me)
Da-da-dance, don't hold the wall
