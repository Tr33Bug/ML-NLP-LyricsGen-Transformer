Filthy Lyrics
Hey, if you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
Hey, if you know what's good
(If you know what's good)

Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
All my haters gon' say it's fake
I guess I got my swagger back
I said, "put your filthy hands all over me"
You know this ain't the clean version
And what you gonna do with all that meat?
Cooking up a mean serving, huh

No question, I want it
Fire up, everybody smokin'
Your friends, my friends and they ain't leaving 'til six in the morning
Six in the morning
Come chill, baby, you the coldest
Go for 'em, put 'em on notice
You don't wanna walk through here

Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah
Exactly what you like times two, yeah
Got me singing, "ooh, ooh"
So, baby, don't you mind if I do

Look, put your filthy hands all over me
You know this ain't the clean version
And what you gonna do with all that beast?
When I leave the cage open, huh, walk to me, uh
You might also like
No question, I want it
Fire up, everybody smokin'
Your friends, my friends and they ain't leaving 'til six in the morning
Six in the morning
Come chill, baby, you the coldest
Go for 'em, put 'em on notice
You don't wanna walk through here

Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah
Exactly what you like times two, yeah
Got me singing, "ooh, ooh"
So, baby, don't you mind if I do

Come on, break it down
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
Hey, if you know what's good
(If you know what's good)

Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
All my haters gonna say it's fake
Baby, don't you mind if I do (I do)
Exactly what you like times two (Times two)
Got me singing, "ooh, ooh"
Baby, don't you mind if I do (If I do, come on)

Your friends, my friends and they ain't leaving 'til six in the morning
Six in the morning, m-m-morning
Your friends, my friends and they ain't leaving 'til six in the morning
Six in the morning

So put your filthy hands all over me
You know this ain't the clean version
Go on and put your filthy hands all over me
No, this ain't the clean version

Do you see me?
Can you find me?
Look closer, through the trees
Do you see it?27Embed
