Gimme What I Don’t Know (I Want) Lyrics
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

Why you standing so far away? Minding manners and looking on by
Why don't you come out to play?
And get closer to your animal, inside

Baby, I act like the gentleman that your mama would love (Ooh, get to know me)
Baby, you act like a lady, don’t have to cover it up (Things you wanna show me)
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love (Teach me slowly)
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

Show me your teeth, and spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Rare breed but you’re out as a stray, ay, sideshow in front of the whole crowd

Baby, I act like the gentleman that your mama would love (Ooh, get to know me)
Baby, you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love (Teach me slowly)
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want

Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

Deep in the jungle where the creatures meet
The animals come out when they make the sounds of the beat
They pull out they skin so you can really see
That you’re dealing with a whole new breed

Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle

Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know I want5Embed
