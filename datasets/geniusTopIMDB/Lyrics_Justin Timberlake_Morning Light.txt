Morning Light Lyrics
Look, every time there's a new sunrise
I open up my eyes
And I say to myself, "In the whole wide world of guys
I must be the luckiest alive"

'Cause I'm in love with you
Layin' here in the mornin' light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night
Look, I can't even get out of bed
With the thoughts you're puttin' in my head
So I say to myself, "I don't even wanna try"
Here, every part of me is paralyzed

'Cause I'm in love with you
Layin' here in the mornin' light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Layin' here in the mornin' light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night

I know I got somewhere to go
Mmm, but I'm thinkin' we should lay here real low (Lay here real low)
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's no lie
Ooh, I could watch you 'til the day I die

'Cause I'm in love with you
Layin' here in the mornin' light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Layin' here in the mornin' light (In the mornin' night)
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight just one more, one more nightYou might also like4Embed
