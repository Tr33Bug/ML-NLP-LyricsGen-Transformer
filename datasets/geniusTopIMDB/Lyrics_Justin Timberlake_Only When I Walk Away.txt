Only When I Walk Away Lyrics
Girl, this little game you play
You don't stop 'til you go too far
So what's a man like me to say?
With a bullet laying in my heart

Damn love, we go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do about this damn love?
Is this shit in sync or insane, love?
I guess that's the way we play it
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

What's that, baby, what you say?
'Cause you don’t want to light up this torch
'Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burn it down 'til there ain't no more

Damn love, how did this sound get so amped up?
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is this shit in sync or insane, love
I guess that’s the way we play it

She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

Cold, so cold, yeah
Cold, so cold, yeah
You might also like
You should see the look on your face
Baby, when I finish what you start
I can’t hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Damn love, how did this shit get outta my hands, love?
Laid you to rest, you say (Damn love)
This shit’s insane, it’s insane love
Ain’t that the way we play it

She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, but only when I walk away

Cold, so cold
But only when I walk away
Cold, so cold
You love me, don't you?
But only when I walk away
Cold, so cold
Only when I walk away
Cold, so cold
Only when I walk away
Cold so cold
Tell me, you love me, don't you?
Only when I walk away
Ah, so cold
Ah, so cold
Ah, so cold
Ah, so cold
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
You love me, don't you?
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
She loves me now
She loves me not
She loves me now
But only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
What am I gonna do with all this damn love?
What am I gonna do with all this...
Only when I walk away
Only when I walk away
Hol' up, hol' up
Only when I walk away
(I fuckin' hate you) Hol' up
(You fuckin' ruined me) Hol' up
Only when I walk away
Don't you ever...

She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone and tell me, "Baby do you stay?"
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay"
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay"
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, yelling, begging, crying, "Baby, please stay."
(Only when I walk away)
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone, tell me, "Baby, please stay."
She only love me when I walk away
I said, "Fuck you, bitch, we don't care what you say."10Embed
