Say Something Lyrics
Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh

Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there

Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere
There's melody and harmony for you and me tonight
(Ooh, whoa) I hear them call my name

Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing38Embed
