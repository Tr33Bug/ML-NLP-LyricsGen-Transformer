September Lyrics
Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda

My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
You might also likeAnd we say
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

The bell was ringin', aha
Our souls were singin'
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day

Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

Break it down for me (Say do you remember)
Dancin' in September

Ba de ya
Say do you remember
Do you remember?
Ba de ya - dancin' in September (We're dancin' in September)
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Uh huh! (Bring it back now)
Dancin' in September
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer3Embed
