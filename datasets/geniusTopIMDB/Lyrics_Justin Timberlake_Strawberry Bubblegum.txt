Strawberry Bubblegum Lyrics
Hey, pretty lady
This goes out to you (This goes out to you, you, you)
I know I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day
(This goes out to you, you, you)
This is dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Pretty lady, when you walk by
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, sunshine
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving, it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
And baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you
You might also like
So tell me why we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you don’t wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl, I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving, it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
And baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I'll make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl if you’d be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop


Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want, now, my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet
That's what you told me when I touched on your lips
Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent, ah
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
Then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(Little girl, would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
Hey, hey, hey
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(Little girl, would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I’ll love you 'til I make it pop15Embed
