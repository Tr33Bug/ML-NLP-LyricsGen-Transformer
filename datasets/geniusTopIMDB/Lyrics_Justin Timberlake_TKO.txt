TKO Lyrics
In all, enthrilling new, living sound

Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Lights out, TKO
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult, uh
Girl, I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go? 'Cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

It cuts right on my heart, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

Don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit, babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins if somebody’s heart is swole
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go? It just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

It cuts right on my heart, yeah, it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

Don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit, babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
