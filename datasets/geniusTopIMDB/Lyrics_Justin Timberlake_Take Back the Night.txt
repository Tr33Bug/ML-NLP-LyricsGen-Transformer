Take Back the Night Lyrics
Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it? Listen, uh

Yeah, this was your city
You did it all and more, broke every law except for one, babe
Attraction, are you ready?
I know you feel it, pull you nearer 'til you feel it again, oh

I wanna do somethin' right
But we can do somethin' better
Ain’t no time like tonight
And we ain’t tryna save it 'til later
Stay out here livin' the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
And you got that lil' somethin' I like
A little something I've been wantin' to borrow
Tonight's the night, come on, surrender
I won't lead your love astray, astray, yeah
Your love's a weapon
Give your body some direction
That's my aim, then we could
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there's nothin' left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinnin', sweatin', you can't catch your breath
Take back the night
Ooh, don't know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling's right, then raise your glass and let's
Take back the night

Take back the night
They gon' try to shut us down, but I'll be damned if we gon' let 'em
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you're gon' mess around and find out there ain't no one better
Take back the night, oh
Yeah

Rare, there's not too many
No one but you and crowded rooms, we can do anything (Yeah)
Attraction can drive you crazy
And the way you move when you go crazy, that's incentive for me

I wanna do somethin' right
But we can do somethin' better
There ain't no time like tonight
And we ain't tryna save it for later
Stay out here living the life
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow
And you got that lil' somethin' I like
A little something I've been wantin' to borrow
Tonight's the night, come on, surrender
I won't lead your love astray, astray, yeah
Your love's a weapon
Give your body some direction
That's my aim, then we could
You might also like
Take back the night
Come on, use me up until there's nothing left
Take back the night
Dizzy, spinnin', sweatin', you can't catch your breath
Take back the night
Ooh, don't know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling's right, then raise your glass and let's
Take back the night

Take back the night
They gon' try to shut us down, but I'll be damned if we gon' let 'em
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you're gon' mess around and find out there ain't no one better

Break it, break it down now
Break it, break it down now
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Yeah, yeah, oh, uh
(And the horns say, alright)
(And the horns say, alright)
(Uh, ooh, and the horns say, alright)
(And the horns say)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)
Take it over
Yeah, yeah
Y'all ready to have a good time out there, ladies and gentlemen?
Ladies and gentlemen, JT and the Tennessee kids
Let your hair down, baby
Take back the night, take back the night
Take back the night
Ooh, we don't know when the sun is rising next
Take back the night
So if the feeling's right, then raise your glass and let's
Take back the night

Take back the night, take back the night
They gon' try to shut us down, I'll be damned if we gon' let them
Take back the night, take back the night
You know you're gon' mess around and find out there ain't no one better

(And the horns say) Alright
(And the horns say) Uh
(And the horns say) Feels good to me
(And the horns say) Alright, ooh
Take it over
