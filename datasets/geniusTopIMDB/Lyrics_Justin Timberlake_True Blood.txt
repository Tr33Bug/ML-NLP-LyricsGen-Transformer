True Blood Lyrics
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Red was the color of her eyes
She put me in a meditation state
Her skin is white, so white
Looked like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
When it's time for feeding and her body wakes
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out in me
When we raise hell, I can't stay away

Aw, give it to me now
(So evil in the dress)
It circulates, you start to feel it
(Devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to evoke the spirit
(Got you on the floor)
Ooh, she comes alive when you look killing
(Hungry for some more)

Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round, I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
You might also like
It makes me say...

Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I don’t want to escape
All of you ones that have tried
Find out that they have made the final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect bloodmate

Aw, give it to me now
(So evil in the dress)
It circulates, you start to feel it
(Devil in the flesh)
Once she starts to evoke the spirit
(Got you on the floor)
Ooh, she comes alive when you look killing
(Hungry for some more)

Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round, I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say...
It makes me say...

Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad
I don't wanna think
'Cause the others wanna burn with me
But they don't hold a candle
It feels like

It feels like...
The others wanna burn with me
But they don't hold a candle (Candle, candle, candle)
Now, some funky guitar...
Give it to me...
(Break)

Hey, I think she's got that true blood
Every time you're 'round, I can smell it in you
She's got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
It's that demon next to me that's got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
She's got that true blood
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes say...

Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah, give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl


Yeah...
Yeah...
Yeah...
Yeah...
Yeah...
Now that you got me
(Now that you got me)
Tell me what you gonna do with me
(Tell me what you gonna do)
I taste your blood
And found out you were the perfect fit
C'mon, momma (C'mon)
Show me what you're working with
C'mon, momma (C'mon)
And, show me what you're working with
(Show me what you working with)
Now that you got me
Tell me what you gonna do with me
'Cause I can taste your blood
I found out you were my perfect fit
C'mon, momma
Show me what you're working with
I said, "C'mon, momma"
And, show me what you're working with

You got that (True blood)
We got that (True blood)
You got that (True blood)
