True Colors Lyrics
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged, oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
The darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

Show me a smile then, don't be unhappy
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just, call me up
'Cause I will always be there
And I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors are beautiful
I see your true colors, shining through (True colors)
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow, ohh, ohh, ohh like a rainbow

Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing, oh-ohhh
This world makes you crazy
Taking all you can bear
Just, call me up
'Cause I'll be always be there

And I see your true colors, shining through
I see your true colors, and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
To let them show
Your true colors, true colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow (Ohh-ohh)
Like a rainbow, ooh-oohYou might also like13Embed
