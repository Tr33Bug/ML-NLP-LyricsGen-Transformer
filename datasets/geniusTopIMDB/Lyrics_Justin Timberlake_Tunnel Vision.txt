Tunnel Vision Lyrics
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it

Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
For too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore

A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you, yeah
You might also like
Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you, yeah
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
In on you, in, in on you
I only see you, yeah
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
In on you, in, in on you
I only see you, yeah

I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it

A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you, yeah

I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I only see you, yeah
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I know you like it, I know you like it
I only see you, yeah29Embed
