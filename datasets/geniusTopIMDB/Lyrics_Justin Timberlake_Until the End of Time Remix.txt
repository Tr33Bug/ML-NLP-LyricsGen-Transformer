TranslationsTürkçeUntil the End of Time (Remix) Lyrics
Ooh
Oh-oh-oh
Hey, hey
Hey
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Sing
Listen
I woke up this mornin'
And heard the TV sayin' somethin'
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm goin'
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me lets me know that I'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had, in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

You got me singin', Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
Ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
Everybody, sing, Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
Everybody's singin', Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah

Now if you're ever wonderin'
About the way I'm feelin'
Well, baby boy, there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing
Sick and tired of tryna save the world
I just wanna spend my time bein' your girl
And what you give me lets me know that we'll be alright

Until the end of time

Boy, you got me singin', Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
You got me singin', ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
Everybody's singin', ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
Everybody's singin', ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah
