Until the End of Time Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Hey, hey, oh yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Listen

I woke up this mornin'
And heard the TV sayin' somethin'
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm goin'
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me lets me know that I'll be alright
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Well, that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

You got me singin', "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah"
Ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
Everybody, sing, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah"
Everybody's singin', "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah"

Now if you're ever wonderin'
About the way I'm feelin'
Well, baby girl, there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessin'
Sick and tired of tryna save the world
I just wanna spend my time with you, girl
And what you give me lets me know that we'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had (All I had) in this life
(Don't you know that?) That would be enough until the end of time
(Oh, whoa)
Rest your weary heart (Rest your heart) and relax your mind (Relax your mind 'cause)
'Cause I'm gonna love you, girl, until the end of time

Girl, you got me singin', "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah"
Ohh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah
Everybody, sing, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah"
Everybody's singin', "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa, yeah"

This one's for the lovers
If you're out there, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Break it down one time

Oh, oh oh, oh oh oh, whoa, yeah
Oh, oh oh, whoa
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh, oh oh, whoa
'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
That would be enough until the end of time6Embed
