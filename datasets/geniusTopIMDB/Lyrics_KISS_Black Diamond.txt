Black Diamond Lyrics
Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Got you under their thumb
Hit it!

Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond

Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too (ooh-ooh-ooh)
And though you don't ask for pity
There's nothing that you can do, no no

Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond


Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

Whoo, black diamond, yeah
Whoo, black diamond
