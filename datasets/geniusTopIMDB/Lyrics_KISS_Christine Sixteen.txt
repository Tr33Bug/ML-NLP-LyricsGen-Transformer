Christine Sixteen Lyrics
She's got me dizzy
She sees me through to the end
She's got me in her hands
And there's no use in pretending

Christine sixteen
Christine sixteen

She drives me crazy
I want to give her what I've got
And she's hot every day and night
There is no doubt about it
(Christine sixteen)
I don't usually say things like this to girls your age
But when I saw you coming out of school that day
(Christine sixteen)
That day I knew, I knew
I've got to have you, I've got to have you

She's been around, but she's young and clean
I've got to have her, can't live without her, whoa no

Christine sixteen
Christine sixteen
