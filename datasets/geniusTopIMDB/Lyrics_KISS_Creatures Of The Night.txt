Creatures Of The Night Lyrics
Searching in the darkness, running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow, nothing left to say
Victims of the moment, future deep in doubt
Living in a whisper until we start to shout

We're creatures of the night, we're creatures of the night, hey

Breathing in the madness, spitting out the lies
Searching for an answer, keep your alibis
Don't know where we're going, just know where we've been
Remember when the clock strikes twelve, the losers always win

Searching in the darkness, running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow, nothing left to say
Gathering up our courage, ready for the fight
Howling in the shadows until we start to bite
