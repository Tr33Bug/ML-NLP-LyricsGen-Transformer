Domino Lyrics
Lemme tell ya my story
I got a man-sized predicament
And it's a big one, goes like this, yeah

My my
Ow! Yeah..
Never had confession, never had a home
Never had no worry, until I met Domino
Ain't the virgin Mary, love her I confess
Got my hesitations
Because she kisses like the kiss of death
Loves lots of money, back's against the wall
Calls me Sugar Daddy
She knows she's-a got me by the balls
They call her Domino -so fine
Ow
Got a reputation, haven't got a hope
It's a sticky situation
If she ain't old enough to vote
Loves to play with fire, loves to hurt so good
Loves to keep me burning
Because she's a bad habit, bad habit
Bad habit that's good, good, good
They call her Domino, Domino, Domino
Do it, Bruce do it
Ow!
Every damn time I walk through that door
It's the same damn thing
That bitch bends over, and I forget my name - ow
Loves lots of money, back's against the wall
Calls me Sugar Daddy
She knows she's-a got me by the balls - ow!
Loves to play with fire, love her I confess
Got no hesitations, because she's a bad habit, yeah
Bad habit, she's a bad habit!
