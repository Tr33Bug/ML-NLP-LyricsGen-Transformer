Forever Lyrics
I got to tell you what I'm feeling inside, I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes, girl I'm out of my head over you
I lived so long believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time

It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be loving you forever

I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't want to go it alone
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be loving you forever
Yeah!

I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
Because I lived my life believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time

It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be loving you forever
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be loving you foreverYou might also like3Embed
