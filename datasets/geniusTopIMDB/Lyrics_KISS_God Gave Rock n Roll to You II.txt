God Gave Rock ‘n’ Roll to You II Lyrics
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone

Do you know what you want? You don't know for sure
You don't feel right, you can't find a cure
And you're getting less than what you're looking for
You don't have money or a fancy car
And you're tired of wishing on a falling star
You got to put your faith in a loud guitar
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone (oh yeah)
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone

"Now listen"
If you want to be a singer, or play guitar
Man, you got to sweat or you won't get far
Because it's never too late to work nine-to-five
You can take a stand, or you can compromise
You can work real hard or just fantasize
But you don't start living until you realize -I got to tell ya!

God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone


God gave rock and roll to you (to everyone he gave the song to be sung)
Gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you (to everyone he gave the song to be sung)
Gave rock and roll to you, saved rock and roll for everyone
Saved rock and roll
You might also like
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone (oh, yeah)
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to everyone
God gave rock and roll to you, gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone

I know life sometimes can get tough! And I know life sometimes can be a drag!
But people, we have been given a gift, we have been given a road
And that road's name is... Rock and Roll!

Yeah
Oh yeah  yeah  yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oooooo
Yeah! Hey!
That mean you! And you! That means you too!
How many people here like the sound of rock and roll music?
Well, I do! I do! I do!..2Embed
