Hard Luck Woman Lyrics
If never I met you
I'd never have seen you cry
If not for our first "Hello"
We'd never have to say goodbye

If never I held you
My feelings would never show
It's time I start walking
But there's so much you'll never know
I keep telling you, hard luck woman
You ain't a hard luck woman

Rags, a sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love ya
I can't forget about ya
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, 'til you find your man

Before I go, let me kiss you
And wipe the tears from your eyes
I don't wanna hurt you, girl
You know I could never lie

I keep telling you, hard luck woman
You ain't a hard luck woman
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, 'til you find your man

Rags, a sailor's only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags, I really love ya
I can't forget about ya
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, 'til you find your man
You'll be a hard luck woman
Baby, 'til you find your man

Oh yeah, bye-bye, so long, don't cry
I'm just packing my bags, whoa, leaving you
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, baby, don't cry
I gotta keep on movin', yeah, movin'
Bye-bye, my baby
Ooh, don't cry, lady, oh1Embed
