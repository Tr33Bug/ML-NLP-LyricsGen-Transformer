Heavenâ€™s on Fire Lyrics
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uuuuuhhhh

I look at you and my blood boils hot
I feel my temperature rise
I want it all, give me what you got
There's hunger in your eyes
I'm getting closer, baby hear me breathe (hah, hah, hah)
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and you'll never leave
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire

I got a fever raging in my heart
You make me shiver and shake
Baby don't stop
Take it to the top, eat it like a piece of cake
You're coming closer, I can hear you breathe (hah, hah, hah)
You drive me crazy when you start to tease
You could bring the devil to his knees

Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire

Oooohhh-oh Heaven's on fire, Oooohhh-oh Heaven's on fire, Oooohhh-oh

I'm getting closer, baby hear me breathe (hah, hah, hah)
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and you'll never leave
You might also like
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly, Heaven's on fire13Embed
