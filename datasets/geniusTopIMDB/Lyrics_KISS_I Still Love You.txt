I Still Love You Lyrics
You tell me that you're leaving
And I'm trying to understand
I had myself believing
I should take it like a man
But if you've got to go then you've got to know
That it's killing me
And all the things I never seem to show
I've got to make you see
Girl, it's been so long
(Tell me) Tell me how could it be
One of us knows the two of us don't belong
In each others company
It hurts so much inside, you're telling me goodbye
You want to be free
And knowing that you're gone and leaving me behind
I gotta make you see
I gotta make you see
I gotta make you see

I still love you
I still love you
I really, I really love you
I still love you

People tell me
I should win at any cost
But now I see as the smoke clears away
The battle has been lost
I see it in your eyes, you never have to lie
I'm out of your life
Tonight I'll dream away and you can still be mine
But I'm dreaming a lie
Dreaming a lie
Makes me want to die
You might also like
'Cause I still love you
I still love you
Baby baby, I love you
I still love you

And when I think of all the things you'll never know
There's so much left to say
'Cause girl, now I see the price of losing you
Will be my hell to pay
My hell to pay
Each and every day
Hear what I say

I still love you
I still love you
I really, I really love you
I still love you
Baby baby, I love you
I love you
I really, I really love you3Embed
