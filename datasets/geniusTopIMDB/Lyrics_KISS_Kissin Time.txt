Kissinâ€™ Time Lyrics
Come on, Charlotte
Wake up, San Diego, Milwaukee, Miami
Put your two lips together and kiss

We're kissing in Cleveland and Cincinnati too
Way out in Chicago, I'll tell you what to do
They party all over, even in St. Lou
So, baby, get ready, and I'll be kissing you
Oh-oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight

We're kissing in Dallas
And Philly's going wild
So let's kiss Atlanta, ho!
You know we'll make it smile
Oh, we love the women, hey!
Way down in Tennessee
So, baby, come on now, and start a-kissing me, yeah!

Oh-oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight


Kiss all of Seattle, LA to Baltimore
You know we been kissing in 'Frisco, so let's kiss some more
Let's do it in Detroit, they all know the score
So, baby, oh baby, what are we waiting for?
You might also like
Oh-oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight

Oh-oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonight
Oh-oh, 'cause anytime is a kissing time, USA
So treat me right, don't make me fight
And we'll rock and roll tonightEmbed
