Lick It Up Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Don't want to wait until you know me better
Let's just be glad for the time together
Life's such a treat and it's time you taste it
There isn't a reason on earth to waste it
It isn't a crime to be good to yourself

Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (It's only right now)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Woo yeah)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Come on, come on)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Uh)
Don't need to wait for an invitation
You got to live like you're on vacation
There's something sweet you can't buy with money
Lick it up, lick it up
It's all you need, so believe me honey
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself

Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (It's only right now)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Woo yeah)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Come on, come on)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Come on)

It's only right now (it's only right now)
Ooh yeah (ooh yeah) ooh yeah (ooh yeah), yeah yeah
Oooooooohhhhhh, wooo!

Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (It's only right now)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Woo yeah)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Come on, come on)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Aww)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh-oh-ohh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)You might also like4Embed
