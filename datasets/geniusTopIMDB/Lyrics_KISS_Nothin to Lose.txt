Nothinâ€™ to Lose Lyrics
Before I had a baby
I didn't care anyway
I thought about the back door
I didn't know what to say, yeah yeah
But once I got a baby
I, I tried every way
She didn't wanna do it
But she did anyway, yeah yeah
But, baby, please don't refuse
You know you got nothin' to lose

(You got nothin' to lose)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Well, nothin')
You got, got nothin' to lose (Yeah, baby)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Whoo, you got nothin')
You got, got nothin' to lose (You g-g-g-g-got nothin')
You got, got nothin' to lose (Well, come on, mama)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Yeah, shake your huh)
You got, got
You got, you got, you got nothin' to lose

So now I got a baby
And we've tried every way
You know she wants to do it
And she does anyway, yeah yeah

But, baby, please don't refuse
You know you got nothing to lose

(You got nothin' to lose)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Yeah, baby)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Ha ha ha ha ha, yeah)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Ah, you feel so good)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Well, come on, mama)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch yeah)
You got, got nothin' to lose (Well, come on)
You got, got
You got, you got, you got nothin' to lose
