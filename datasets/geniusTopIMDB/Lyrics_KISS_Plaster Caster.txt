Plaster Caster Lyrics
Baby's getting anxious, the hour's getting late
The night is almost over, she can't wait
Oh, things are complicating, my love is in her hands
And there's no more waiting, she understands

The plaster's gettin' harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love
For her collection, her collection
Plaster caster, grab a hold of me faster
And if you wanna see my love, just ask her

And my love is the plaster, yeah, she's the collector
She wants me all the time to inject her

The plaster's gettin' harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love
For her collection

Plaster caster (Plaster caster)
Grab a hold of me faster (Plaster, faster)
And if you wanna see my love, just ask her (Ask her)
Go on, ask her


The plaster's gettin' harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love
For her collection

Plaster caster (Plaster caster)
Grab a hold of me faster (Plaster, faster)
If you wanna see my love, just ask her (Ask her)

Plaster caster (Plaster caster)
She wants my love to last her (Last her, last her)
And she calls me by the name of master (Master)

Plaster caster (Plaster caster)
Grab a hold of me faster (Plaster, faster)
If you wanna see my love, just ask her (Ask her)

Plaster caster (Plaster caster)
Grab a hold of me faster (Plaster, faster)
And if you wanna see my love, just ask her (Ask her)1Embed
