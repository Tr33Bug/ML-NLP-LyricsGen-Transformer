She Lyrics
She walks by moonlight
No one really knows
Enchanted starlight
Never going home

I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good

Doing well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes
I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so good


Doing well for others
She doesn't really know
The powers are within her
As she takes off her clothes

I know she's going down, going
Everybody knows she's so goodYou might also likeEmbed
