Shock Me Lyrics
Your lightning's all I need
My satisfaction grows
You make me feel at ease
You even make me glow

Don't cut the power on me
I'm feeling low, so get me high

Shock me (Make me feel better)
Shock me (Put on your black leather)
Shock me (We can come together)
And baby, if you do what you've been told
My insulation's gone
Girl, you make me overload

Don't pull the plug on me, no no
Keep it in and keep me high

Shock me (Make me feel better)
Shock me (Put on your black leather)
Shock me (We can come together)
C'mon


Shock me (Baby)
Shock me (Oh yeah)
Shock me (Baby)
Shock me (Oh yeah)

Shock me (Make me feel better, oh yeah)
Come on and shock me (Put on your black leather, baby)
I'm down to the bare wire
Shock me (We can come together, oh yeah)
I wanna feel your power
You might also like
Shock me (Make me feel better, oh yeah)
I'm down to the bare wire
Shock me (Put on your black leather, baby)
Come on, come on, shock me1Embed
