War Machine Lyrics
Want to bite the hand that feeds me, want to turn the tides
Set the demons free and watch them fly
Strike down the one who leads me, I'm going to take his place
Going to vindicate the human race

Better watch out because I'm a war machine
Better watch out because I'm a war machine

Take the reins of power and seize them
Draw the battle lines
Armageddon's just a matter of time
Tear down the voice of reason, let the arrows fly
Your freedom's just a state of mind, yeah
Better watch out because I'm a war machine
Better watch out because I'm a war machine
Better watch out because I'm a war machine
Better watch out because I'm a war machine
Better watch out because I'm a war machine
Better watch out because I'm a war machineYou might also likeEmbed
