Computer Love Lyrics[Intro]
Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love

[Verse 1]
Another lonely night, another lonely night
Stare at the TV screen, stare at the TV screen
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
I need a rendezvous, I need a rendezvous
[Chorus]
Computer love
Computer love
Computer love
Computer love

[Verse 2]
I call this number, I call this number
For a data date, for a data date
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
I need a rendezvous, I need a rendezvous

[Chorus]
Computer love
Computer love
Computer love
Computer love
