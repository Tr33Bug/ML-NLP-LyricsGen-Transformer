Computer Love Lyrics
Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love
Computer love, computer love

Another lonely night, another lonely night
Stare at the TV screen, stare at the TV screen
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
I need a rendezvous, I need a rendezvous
Computer love
Computer love
Computer love
Computer love

I call this number, I call this number
For a data date, for a data date
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do
I need a rendezvous, I need a rendezvous

Computer love
Computer love
Computer love
Computer love
