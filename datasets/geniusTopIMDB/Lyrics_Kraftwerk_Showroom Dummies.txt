Showroom Dummies Lyrics
Eins, zwei, drei, vier

We are standing here
Exposing ourselves
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We're being watched
And we feel our pulse
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We look around
And change our pose
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We start to move
And we break the glass
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We step out
And take a walk through the city
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We go into a club
And there we start to dance
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummiesYou might also likeEmbed
