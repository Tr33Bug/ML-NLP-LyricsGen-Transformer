Showroom Dummies Lyrics[Intro]
Eins, zwei, drei, vier

[Verse 1]
We are standing here
Exposing ourselves
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

[Verse 2]
We're being watched
And we feel our pulse
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
[Verse 3]
We look around
And change our pose
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

[Verse 4]
We start to move
And we break the glass
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

[Verse 5]
We step out
And take a walk through the city
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

[Verse 6]
We go into a club
And there we start to dance
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

[Outro]
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummiesYou might also likeEmbed
