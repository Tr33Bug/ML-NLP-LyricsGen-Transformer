TranslationsРусскийThe Model Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's a model and she's looking good
I'd like to take her home, that's understood
She plays hard to get, she smiles from time to time
It only takes a camera to change her mind

[Verse 2]
She's going out to nightclubs, drinking just champagne
And she has been checking nearly all the men
She's playing her game and you can hear them say
She is looking good, for beauty we will pay
[Verse 3]
She's posing for consumer products now and then
For every camera, she gives the best she can
I saw her on the cover of a magazine
Now she's a big success, I want to meet her againYou might also like1Embed
