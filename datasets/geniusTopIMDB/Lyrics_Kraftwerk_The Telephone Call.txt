The Telephone Call Lyrics[Verse 1]
I give you my affection and I give you my time
Trying to get a connection on the telephone line

[Hook]
You're so close but far away
I call you up all night and day

[Verse 1]
I give you my affection and I give you my time
Trying to get a connection on the telephone line
[Hook]
You're so close but far away
I call you up all night and day
You're so close but far away
I call you up all night and day

[Verse 2]
I give you my affection and I give you my time
Trying to get a connection on the telephone line
I call you up from time to time
To hear your voice on the telephone line
I call you up from time to time
To hear your voice on the telephone lineYou might also likeEmbed
