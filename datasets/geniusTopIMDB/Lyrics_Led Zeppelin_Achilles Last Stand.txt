Achillesâ€™ Last Stand Lyrics
It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh, to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh, to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah
Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah

Oooooh, yeah

Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh, Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again
You might also like
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth, oh, oh, oh , oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
(Ohhhhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhhh)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oooooh oooh, oh3Embed
