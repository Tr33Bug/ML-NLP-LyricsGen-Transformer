TranslationsPortuguÃªsCommunication Breakdown Lyrics
Hey, girl, stop what you're doin'!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your loving touch

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane
Hey, babe, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane
Suck!


Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane! Yeah!

Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me all night)
(I want you to love me all night)
Communication breakdown
(Whoa, ah, a whoa oh)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me)
(I want you to love)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love, yeah)
(I want you to love)
Communication breakdown
(I want you to love)...You might also like3Embed
