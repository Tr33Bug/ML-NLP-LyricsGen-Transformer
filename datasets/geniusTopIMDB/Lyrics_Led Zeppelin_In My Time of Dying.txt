In My Time of Dying Lyrics
In my time of dying, want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do is take my body home
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus got to make out, should know
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make it my dying bed

Meet me, Jesus, meet me, ooh, meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord, please meet me with another pair
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Oh, oh, well, well, well, so I can die easy, Jesus gonna make up
Somebody, somebody, oh, oh
Jesus going to make up, Jesus going to make it my dying bed
Oh, Saint Peter, at the gates of heaven, won't you let me in?
I never did no harm, I never did no wrong
Oh, oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn, let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did no harm, did no harm
I've only made the young ones, I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong
No, not once, oh no
Ah good


Oh, I did somebody some good, somebody some good, yeah, oh
Oh, did somebody some good, yeah, I must of did somebody some good, yeah
Oh, I believe I did
I see the smiling faces, I know there must be lipstick traces, oh


And I see them in the streets and I see them in the field
And I hear them at my feet and I know it's got to be real
Oh Lord, deliver me, all the wrong I've done
Oh, you can deliver me, Lord, I only wanted to have some fun
Oh, hear the angels marching, they're marching
Hear them marching, hear them marching, the marching

Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
My Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, ah, oh
Ah my Jesus, hey, yeah, it's got to be my Jesus, oh-whoa
It's got to be, it's got to be my Jesus, it's got to be, oh
It's got to be my Jesus, oh, take me home
Come on, come on, I can hear the angels singing
Oh, here they come, here they come, here they come
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Oh, it feels pretty good up here, pretty good up here
Oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Ooh, I'll see you again, come on
Take it, take it, take it, take it, yeah, yeah, hey, hey, ooh yes
Oh, I'm goin' to make it my dying, dying, dying...
