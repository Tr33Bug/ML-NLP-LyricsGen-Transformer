No Quarter Lyrics
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight, oh oh
The snow falls hard, and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter
Aaaah!


Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more, oh
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh

They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Oh!
The pain, the pain without quarter, oh yeah!
They ask no quarter (Without quarter, quarter, quarter)
They give no quarter (Giving me, giving me no...)
Oh (I hear the dogs of doom are howling more!)You might also like21Embed
