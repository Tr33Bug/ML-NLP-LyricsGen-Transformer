Since Iâ€™ve Been Loving You Lyrics
Oh!

Working from seven
To eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
'Cause I love you, baby, how I love you, darling
How I love you, baby, my beloved little girl, little girl
But, baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you, I really did the best I could

I've been, I've been working from seven
To eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now!

Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind

Watch out!

I said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears, they fell like rain
Don't you hear them? Don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them? Don't you hear them falling?

Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, I hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them newfangled
Newfangled back-door men
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been a-working from seven, seven, seven
To eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag
A drag, drag
Ah yeah! It makes it a drag

Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
And just one more, just one more
Oh, yeah!
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind22Embed
