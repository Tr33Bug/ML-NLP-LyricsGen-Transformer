Tangerine Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three, four
One, two

Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours, they bring me pain

Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again
And I do


Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in betweenYou might also like13Embed
