Trampled Under Foot Lyrics
Greased and slicked down fine
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road
Mama, it ain't no sin

Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
Ooh, trouble-free transmission
Helps your oils flow
Mama, let me pump your gas
Mama, let me do it all

Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

Check that heavy metal
Underneath your hood
Baby, I can work all night
Believe I got the perfect tools

Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

A model built for comfort
Really built with style
Specialist tradition
Mama, let me feast my eyes
You might also like
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

Factory air-conditioned
Heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours
Mama, it's the perfect size

Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout

Grooving on the freeway
Gauge is on the red
Gun down on my gasoline
Believe I'm gonna crack a head

Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout...
I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about
Ooh, yeah, yes
Drive on
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes
I'm coming through

Come to me for service
Every hundred miles
Baby, let me check your points
Fix your overdrive

Talking 'bout love
I'm talking 'bout love
I'm talking 'bout

Ooh yeah, fully automatic
Comes in any size
Makes me wonder what I did
Before we synchronized

Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
I'm talking 'bout

Oooh, feather-light suspension
Konis couldn't hold
I'm so glad I took a look
Inside your showroom doors

Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
Oh, I can't
Oh, I can't

Oh, I can't stop talking about love
I can't stop talking about love
Ooh, let me go on down, go on down
Go on down, go on down, go on down, yeah
I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about love, oh yeah
I can't stop talking about love or my baby
I can't stop talking about love, my baby
My baby, my baby, yeah
Push, push
Push it
Push, push
Oooooooohhh7Embed
