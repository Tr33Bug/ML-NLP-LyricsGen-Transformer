What Is and What Should Never Be Lyrics
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time
Oh..
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh, what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be?

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time


So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you, yeah

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky, ...
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine, by taking our time
You might also like
Hey, ho, but the wind won't blow, and we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show
Catch the wind, we're going to see it spin, we're going to...sail, leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? Oh, I love ya
Do no no no no no no. C'mon now
I want you now14Embed
