All Night Long Lyrics
All night long
All night long I think of you
All night long
All night long I think of you
Well, I'm worryin' about my baby
But my baby won't be true

All day
All day I sit and cry
All day
All day I sit and cry
Well, I'm worryin' about my baby
How my baby pass me by?
Ow, sock it to 'em

I thank you, baby
Everything you done for me
I thank you, baby
Everything you done for me
Well, you know that I love you
My heart is so full of miseryYou might also likeEmbed
