Baby Lyrics
Baby
Don't you need a man like me?
Yeah yeah yeah yes, baby
Don't you need a man like me?
We could be so happy together
Try to raise a family

Baby
Sorry I've got to go
Yeah yeah yeah yes, baby
Sorry I've got to go
I'm going to come back to see you, baby
When you wanna love me some more
Yes, baby
Don't you need a man around?
Yes, baby
Don't you need a man around?
We could be so happy together
I'm the sweetest man in town

Baby
Sorry I've got to go
Yeah yeah yeah, baby
Sorry I've got to go
I'm going to come back to see you, baby
When you wanna love me some moreYou might also likeEmbed
