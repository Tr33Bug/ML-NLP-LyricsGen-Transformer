By the Light of the Silvery Moon Lyrics
By the light of the silvery moon
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Oh, oh, honeymoon, keep a shining in June
Your silvery beam will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon
By the light of the moon

Oh, oh, by the light of the silvery moon
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Oh, oh, honeymoon, keep a shining in June
Your silvery beam will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon
By the light of the moon

Mhm, by the light of the silvery moon
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Oh, oh, honeymoon, keep a shining in June
Your silvery beam will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon
By the light of the moon

Oh, oh, by the light of the silvery moon
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Oh, oh, honeymoon, keep a shining in June
Your silvery beam will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon
