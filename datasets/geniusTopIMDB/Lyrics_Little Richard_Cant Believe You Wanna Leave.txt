Canâ€™t Believe You Wanna Leave Lyrics
I can't believe you wanna to leave
When you know that'll hurt me so
Down on bended knee
Oh, beggin' please not to go

Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that that'll drive me mad
My life, my heart
My love is in your hands
And now you gonna leave me
You gonna leave me for another man

Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that'll drive me mad


Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Don't you know that'll drive me madYou might also likeEmbed
