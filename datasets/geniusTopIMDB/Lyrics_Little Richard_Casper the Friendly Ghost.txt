Casper the Friendly Ghost Lyrics
Casper the friendly ghost
The friendliest ghost you know
Though grown-ups might look in anger and fright
The children all love him so
Casper the friendly ghost
He couldn't be bad or mean
You know he jump and play, sing and dance all day
The friendliest ghost you've ever seen

He always say, "Hello"
He's really glad to meet ya
Wherever he may go
You know he's kind to every living creature
Grown ups don't understand
Why children all love him the most
But kids all know that he loves them so
Casper the friendly ghost

Casper, and he's friendly
And he's friendly
Woo
Ow, ow, ow, ow

He always say, "Hello"
He's always glad to meet ya
Wherever he may go
He's kind to every living creature

Grown-ups don't understand
Why children all love him the most
And kids all know that he loves them so
Casper the friendly ghost
