Good Golly Miss Molly Lyrics
Good Golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good Golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

From the early, early morning
To the early, early night
When you caught Miss Molly
Rocking at the House of Blue Lights
Good Golly, Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

Momma, Papa told me
"Son, you better watch your step"
If they knew about Miss Molly
I'd have to watch my pa myself

Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
Ahhhhh!


Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Oh, when you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

Going to the corner
Gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you hug me and kiss me
Make me ting-a-ling-a-ling
You might also like
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call2Embed
