Green Power LyricsPeople talkin' about the power of love
They said it moves mountains, oh yes indeed
But what will love buy you?
From life's sweet fountain?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Give me the power to buy me happiness
When I don't have enough
To buy some easy living
When things get rough
Come on
Come on
And give me that
(Green power)
Hey, give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Do it to me
(Green power)
Hey hey hey
Give it to me
Give it to me, y'all
Money can't buy you love
(Buy you love)
That's oh so true
Oh yes it is
So that when love has broke your heart
Money will comfort you
Oh yes it will, oh yes it will
Well, if money is number two
We have to try a little harder
So when love runs out
We can make it a little farther
Come on
Come on
And give me that
(Green power)
Hey!
Give me
Give me
Give me
Give it
(Green power)
Sock it to me
Sock it to me
Sock it to me
Sock it to me

Oh yes oh yes
Say all the love in the whole wide world
You gonna give it all to me
Oh yes, baby
What else you got for me, honey?
Sock it to me

Got to have it
Make it green

Oh baby, give me the old presidents
Just to pay my little rent, now

Somebody know that I want it
Got to have it, don't have none
Need it, y'all
(Green power)
Everybody wants some, Everywhere
Everybody needs some
