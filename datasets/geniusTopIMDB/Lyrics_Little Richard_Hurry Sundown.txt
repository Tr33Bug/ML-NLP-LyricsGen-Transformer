Hurry Sundown LyricsHurry down
Hurry down. sun
Hurry down
I said, sun
Won't you hurry on, on down?
Let the weary day be over
I'm so tired of the hurt
I've been taking, my heart has been aching so
Don't mind struggling
I don't mind livin' on a little
If someday my kids
Are laughing together
And having things that I never own
I can feel the change a-coming
Freedom drums in the distance, they are drumming
Telling the world of a brand new future has begun
So you gotta hurry, sundown
I can't wait to see the morning
There's a lot of work
I must lend a hand to
So bring on that new day
A great tomorrow is on its way
(Hurry, sundown)
(Hurry, sundown)
Hurry down, sundown
(Hurry, sundown)
Hurry down, sundown
(Hurry, sundown)
(Hurry, sundown)
Hurry down, sundownYou might also likeEmbed
