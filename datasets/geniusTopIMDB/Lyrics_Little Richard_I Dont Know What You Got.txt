I Donâ€™t Know What You Got Lyrics
You never treat me kind
You're poor, honey, all the time
You doin' me, me no good
I'd leave you if I only could

Baby, I don't know what you got
Honey, I don't know what you got
But it's got me
I believe it's got me
You not very, very much to look at
But you know just where it's at
You don't have one thin dime
Still I can't leave you behind

Baby, I don't know what you got
Honey, I don't know what you got
But it's got me
I'm tellin' you, it's got me

Baby, baby, baby, I feel so all alone
Sometimes I just cry, I sigh
Sometimes I even moan
Because baby, I don't know what it is
But I find myself living at your will
Oh baby, please
Sometimes my best friend comes to me on my job
And he looks at me and he said
"Richard, man, you don't know what's going on"
And I look at my friend because I'm innocent
And my friend look at me and says
"Richard you don't know what's going on
I got something to tell you"
And look what my friend tells me
This what he say to me
You might also like
Now, you cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat on me
But baby let me be

Honey, I don't know what you got
Baby, I don't know what you got
But it's got me
I cry sometimes because I know it's got me

Listen, I gave you all the money I had in the bank
Not one time, not one time did you say thanks

But baby, I don't know what you got
Honey, I say, I don't know what you got
Sometimes it makes my cry
I don't know what you got
I feel sometimes like I wanna to die
I don't, oh oh oh baby
Sometimes it makes me wanna moan
Sometimes it makes me wanna leave my happy homeEmbed
