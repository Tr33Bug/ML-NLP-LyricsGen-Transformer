If Youâ€™re Happy and You Know It Lyrics
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands

If you're happy and you know it
Stomp your feet
If you're happy and you know it
Stomp your feet
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it
If you're happy and you know it
Stomp your feet
If you're happy and you know it
Shout hooray
If you're happy and you know it
Shout hooray
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it
If you're happy and you know it
Shout hooray

If you're happy and you know it
Do all three
If you're happy and you know it
Do all three
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it
If you're happy and you know it
