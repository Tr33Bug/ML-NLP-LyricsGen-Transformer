King of Rock and Roll Lyrics
And it came to pass
That in the year of rock and superstars
King Richard returned from exile to claim his throne
And from around the world, the cry was:
"The King! The King! King Richard is back!
Long live the king! Long live the king!
King Richard is back, the king! King Richard is back!
Long live the king! Long live the king!"

Good golly Miss Molly, go and tell everybody
Every Johnny, Joe and Jack that the king is back
We gonna let it reety-deety, gonna let it all burn
Gonna have a celebration, for the king returns

I'm the king of rock and roll
I'm the king of rock and roll
Now I'm gonna sing and shout it
There ain't no doubt about it
I'm the king of rock and roll

Tom Jones said that daddy in {?]
But I can beat his  with my king sized 


Ike and Tina Turner got an earthquake sound
But I'm the man from Macon and I'm gonna put 'em down
Elvis Presley, have you heard the news?
I'm gonna walk over your blue suede shoes

You might also like
One and two, Three Dog Night
I bet your bark is much bigger than your bite


Creedence Clearwater
Don't you know your honor?
Tell Sly and the Stone to leave rock and roll alone
Aretha Franklin is the queen of soul
But who wants to be the queen
When you're the king of rock and roll?
