Long Tall Sally Lyrics
Gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John
He claim he has the misery but he has a lot of fun

Oh, baby
Yes, baby
Whoo, baby
Having me some fun tonight, yeah

Well, long tall Sally, she's built for speed
She got everything that Uncle John need
Oh, baby
Yes, baby
Whoo, baby
Having me some fun tonight, yeah

Well, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley

Oh, baby
Yes, baby
Whoo, baby
Having me some fun tonight, yeah ow


Well, long tall Sally, she's built for speed
She got everything that Uncle John need

Oh, baby
Yes, baby
Whoo, baby
Having me some fun tonight, yeah
