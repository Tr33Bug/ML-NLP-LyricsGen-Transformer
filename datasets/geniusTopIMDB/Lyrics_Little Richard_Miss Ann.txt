Miss Ann Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, Miss Ann
You're doing something no one can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Miss Ann
You're doing something no one can
Because believing and deceiving
It's driving me to grieving now

I wanna hear, hear, hear Miss Ann
I wanna hear her call my name
I wanna hear, hear, hear Miss Ann
I wanna hear her call my name
Because she can't call it loud
But she calls it so sweet and so plain
Yes, I told Miss Ann once
And I told Miss Ann twice
Yes, I told Miss Ann once
And I told Miss Ann twice
Boys, when I'm with Miss Ann
I'm living in paradise, ow

If she think I'm gonna let her be free
How wrong can Miss Ann be
If she think I'm gonna let her be free
How wrong can Miss Ann be
I'm in love with Miss Ann
And that's the way it's going to beYou might also likeEmbed
