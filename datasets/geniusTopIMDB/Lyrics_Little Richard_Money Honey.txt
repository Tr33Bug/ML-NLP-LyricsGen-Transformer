Money Honey Lyrics
You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I went to the window
I peeped through the blind
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind
He said

Money, honey, a-huh-huh
Money, honey
Money, honey, if you want to get along with me
Well, I screamed and I hollered
I was so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I loved the best
I finally got my baby about half past three
She said I'd like to know what you want with me
I said

Money, honey, a-huh-huh
Money, honey
Money, honey, if you want to get along with me

Well, I said "Tell me baby, what's wrong with you?
From this day on our romance is through?
I said Tell me baby, face to face
How could another man take my place?
She said

Money, honey, a-huh-huh
Money, honey
Money, honey, if you want to get along with me

Well, I've learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the winds may blow
The women may come and the women may go
But before I say I love you so
I want
You might also like
Money, honey, a-huh-huh
Money, honey
Money, honey, if you want to get along with meEmbed
