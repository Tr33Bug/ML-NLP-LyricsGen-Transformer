Poor Dog (Who Canâ€™t Wag His Own Tail) Lyrics
Self-preservation is the first law of nature
Abide by the rules of the one who made you
The good Lord help those who help themselves
Look out for number one before you help somebody else

'Cause it's a poor dog
Now, it's a poor dog
It's a poor dog can't wag his own tail
He can't wag his own tail
Now, it's a mighty poor captain, can't sell his own ship
And it's a poor, poor actor, can't read his own script
It's a poor foundation, can't hold up a house
Now, it's a mighty poor cat, can't even catch a mouse

'Cause it's a poor dog
It's a poor dog
It's a poor dog can't wag his own tail
He can't wag his own tail

Now, a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, oh yeah
Now, a man ain't no stronger than he really really thinks
From little acorns, a big tree grows
And it's a mighty mighty poor rooster that can't even crow

'Cause it's a poor dog
It's a poor dog
It's a poor dog can't wag his own tail
He can't wag his own tail

Now, a poor dog, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a poor dog
It's a poor dog
Woo, a poor dog, hey
Always tend to somebody else's business
And he's always mindin' somebody's business
Listenin' and barkin'
I can hear him howlin'
He's a poor dog, woo-hoo, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
