Ready Teddy Lyrics
Ready, set, go man go
I got a girl that I love so

I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll
Goin' to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock and roll, baby, she's the apple of my eye

I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll

All the flat top cats and all the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint's really jumping, the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style

I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready, whoo
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll, ow

Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll

All the flat top cats and all the dungaree dolls

The joint's really jumping, the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style

I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll

Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock and roll, baby, pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left, I shuffle to the right
Gonna rock and roll to the early, early night
I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll1Embed
