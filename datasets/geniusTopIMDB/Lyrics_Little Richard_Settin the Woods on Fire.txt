Settinâ€™ the Woods on Fire Lyrics
Ah, come on, baby, come on
Ow, ow, ow, ow

Comb your hair, and paint and powder
You act proud and I'll act prouder
You sing loud and I'll sing louder

Tonight we're setting the woods on fire
Hey, you're my girl and I'm your fella
Dress up in your hot pants of yellow
You look swell but I look sweller

Tonight we're setting the woods on fire

We're peeking all the honky tonks
Tonight we're having fun
We'll show the block a brand new dance
That never has been done

Now, I don't care who think that we're silly
You'll be dapper and I'll be dilly
We'll order up two bowls of chili

Tonight we're setting the woods on fire, ow, ow, ow

Ooh, we're setting the woods on
Ooh, we're setting the woods on
Ooh, we're setting the woods on
Tonight we're setting the woods on fire
Ooh, we're setting the woods on
Ooh, we're setting the woods on
Ooh, we're setting the woods on
Tonight we're setting the woods on fire
You might also like
We'll put aside a little time to fix a flat or two
My tires and tubes are doing fine
But the air is showing through
Oh, you clap a hand and I'll start bowing
We'll do all the law allowing
Tomorrow we'll be back down plowing

Tonight we're setting the woods on fire

Set it on fire
Oh, God, we got to set it on fire
Woo-hoo, set it on fire
Hey Lord, we got to set it on fire
I, gotta, gotta set it on fire
Oh, baby, got to set it on fire
Woo, woo, we got to set it on fireEmbed
