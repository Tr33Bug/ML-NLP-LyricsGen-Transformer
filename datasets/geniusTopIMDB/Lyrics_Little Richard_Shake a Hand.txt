Shake a Hand Lyrics
Just leave it to me (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
Don't ever be ashamed (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
Just give me a chance (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
I'll take care of everything (Sha-en-dot-sha-en-dot)
Your troubles I'll share (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
Let me know and I'll be there (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
I'll take care of you (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
Anyplace and anywhere (Sha-en-dot-sha-en-dot)

Shake a hand, shake a hand
(Shake a hand, shake a hand)
Shake a hand, shake a hand
(Shake a hand, shake a hand)
Shake a hand, shake a hand
(Shake a hand, shake a hand)
Shake a hand if you can
(Shake a hand if you can)

Be truthful to me (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
I'll be truthful to you (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
I'm in love with you so (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
Till I don't know what to do (Sha-en-dot-sha-en-dot)
So, let's call it a day (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
I said all I have to say (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
Except don't forget to pray (Sha-en-dot-oh-ho)
And shake a hand every day (Sha-en-dot-sha-en-dot)

Shake a hand, shake a hand
(Shake a hand, shake a hand)
Shake a hand, shake a hand
(Shake a hand, shake a hand)
Shake a hand, shake a hand
(Shake a hand, shake a hand)
Shake a hand if you can
(Shake a hand if you can)You might also likeEmbed
