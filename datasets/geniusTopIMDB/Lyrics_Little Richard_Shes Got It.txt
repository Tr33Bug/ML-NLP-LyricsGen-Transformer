Sheâ€™s Got It Lyrics
There's a sweet little girl that lives down the street
Some people think she's square but I think she's sweet
You can see her every day, strolling up and down the way
Looking so pretty and this is what I say

She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her
Big blue eyes, long black hair
Dimpled cheeks and she's no square

She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her

Ruby lips, shapely hips
When she walks down the street all the cats flip

She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her

She loves to sing, hot rod queen
She's real gone in everything

She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her, ah
You might also like
Loves to sing, hot rod queen
She's real gone in everything

She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her, ah

When the music's hot, loves to bop
She'll dance till the jukebox pop

She's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
Ooh baby, she's got it
I can't do without her, yeah

Yeah, she's got it
Oh, oh, she's got it
Ooh, she's got it
Yeah, she's got it
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, ahEmbed
