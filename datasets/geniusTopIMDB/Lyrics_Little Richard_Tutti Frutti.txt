I got a girl named Sue
She knows just what to do
I got a girl named Sue
She knows just what to do
She rocks to the east, she rocks to the west
But she's the girl that I love best

Tutti frutti, oh rooty
Tutti frutti, oh rooty, whoo

Tutti frutti, oh rooty
Tutti frutti, oh rooty

Got a girl named Daisy
She almost drives me crazy
Got a girl named Daisy
She almost drives me crazy

She knows how to love me, yes, indeed
Boy, you don't know what she do to me

Tutti frutti, oh rooty
Tutti frutti, oh rooty, whoo
