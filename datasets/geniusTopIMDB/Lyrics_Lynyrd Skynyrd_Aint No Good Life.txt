Ain’t No Good Life Lyrics
Yeah

Ain't no good life
Not the one that I lead
'Cause the more I fight the sadness, yeah
It only seems the more that I grieve
Well, I look back on the good times
As some lost part of me
I want to know
Tell me, why is it so?
Well, just 'cause I don't pray
Lord, that don't mean I ain't forgiven
Just because I'm alive
That don't mean I'm making a living
I'm gonna get myself together
I'm gonna try a dying attempt
Talking 'bout the good times slipping by
Yeah, I tell ya now
I don't even know where last month went
Well, I can't make no money, baby
Well, 'cause my money's already spent
And I know where it went
I said it went on that damn rent
Well, I, I don't mean change, baby
I need folding money
Well, I want loving
Said I don't need a buddy
But I don't need nobody now, woo

Ain't exactly my idea
It's sort of old, borrowed and blue
I'm just trying to say don't try that straight life, buddy
Woah, you'll find it kind of hard on you
Women, don't try to cook nothing up, ooh
Brother, you know you'll only wind up in your own stew
Just don't let nobody tell you
Oh, what you oughta doYou might also likeEmbed
