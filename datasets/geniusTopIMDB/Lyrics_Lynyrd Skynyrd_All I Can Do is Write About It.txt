All I Can Do is Write About It Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well this life that I've lead has took me everywhere
There ain't no place I ain't never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just ain't no place like home
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee

[Chorus]
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
[Verse 2]
Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowing
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathing
Well you better listen to my song

[Chorus]
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

[Verse 3]
I'm not trying to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well you can take a boy out of ol' Dixieland
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy

[Outro]
And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Because I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comesYou might also likeEmbed
