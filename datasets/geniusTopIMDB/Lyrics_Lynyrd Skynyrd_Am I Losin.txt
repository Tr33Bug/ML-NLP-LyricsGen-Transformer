Am I Losinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
I recall when I used to come home, never had a dime
But, Lord, I always had a good time
And I recall drinking wine with one of my friends
Lord, I can't go back again

[Chorus]
Am I losin' my own way back home?
Am I losin' a good friend that I've known?
Am I losin', won't you tell me how I've sinned?
Why am I losin' one of my best friends?
[Verse 2]
And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well
It goes to show, Lord, you just can't tell
Now my friend won't talk to me, let me tell you why
He thinks I've changed because of a dollar sign

[Chorus]
Am I losin' my own way back home?
Am I losin' a good friend that I've known?
Am I losin', won't you tell me how I've sinned?
Why am I losin' one of my good friends?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And it's so strange when you get just a little money
Your so-called friends want to act just a little funny
Yes, they'll blame you
But I'm not the one that's here to blame
It's you, my friend, that has really changed
Its a shame, such a shame
Am I losin' once again?

[Verse 3]
Why these things happen, Lord, I don't understand
But, Lord, it can sure hurt a man
Why won't my friend take me as I am?
'Cause your friend, Lord, is the most important thing
You might also like[Chorus]
Am I losin' my own way back home?
Am I losin' a good friend that I've known?
Am I losin', won't you tell me how I've sinned?
Why am I losin' one of my best friends?

Tell me people, what good is that?Embed
