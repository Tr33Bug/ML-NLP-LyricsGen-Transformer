Cheatinâ€™ Woman Lyrics
Cheating woman make you crazy
Cheating woman make you a fool
She'll leave your heart so lonely
Brother there's nothing you can do
Well I can't stand the pain no more
She don't want my love for sure
She don't want poor me
Knocking on her front door

Why did you make me love you sister
When you knew you was untrue
You loved every man with pants on
Yes a dozen for you is too few
Well I'm gon' get my pistol girl
I'm gonna shoot you and end your world
Then you won't bother poor me
Won't bother poor me no longer
Cheating woman - gonna shoot you


Oh woman why you do me
Oh Lord the way you do
I done everything I can baby
Seem like nothing reaches you
Well I'm gonna get that pistol gal
I'm gonna shoot you and all your pals
You ain't gonna bother poor me, yeah
You won't bother poor me no longerYou might also like2Embed
