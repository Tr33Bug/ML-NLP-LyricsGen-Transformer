Cominâ€™ Home Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's been so long since I've been gone
Another day might be too long for me
Traveling around I've had my fill
Of broken dreams and dirty deals
A concrete jungle surrounding me
Many nights I've slept out in the streets
I paid my dues and I changed my style
Seen hard times
All over now
[Chorus]
I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love
To stay

[Verse 2]
I miss old friends that I once had
Times, they've changed and I'll be glad when I
Go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But, why I'm here, I really can't see
And now

[Chorus]
I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love

[Bridge]
To stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days

[Verse 3]
I miss old friends that I once had
Times, they've changed and I'll be glad when I
Go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But, why I'm here, I really can't see
And now

[Chorus]
I want to come home
It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love

[Outro]
To stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better daysEmbed
