Cry for the Bad Man Lyrics
Well, he walks so tall, to be so small
Never met a man who's stranger
He lives his life for a dollar sign
And to deal with him is dangerous
Well, he knocked me down but I'm on my feet
Now I'm so much wiser
I'd rather quit and go back home
Than to deal with the money miser

Let's cry for this bad man
I sing a song for the bad man
Well, you treat me right baby, I'll treat you right
That's the way it's supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me
Well I work seven days a week
Eight when I am able
When you take my money from me, you take food from my mama's table

Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man

Oh baby you know who you are
Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man, way down in Georgia

Well, you treat me right baby, I'll treat you right
That's the way it's supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me
Well, when you take my money baby, when you hurt my family
It's like walking through the swamps without no shoes
Step on a snake, it scares you
You might also like
Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man

Let's cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man

Oh baby straight to you
He's so bad, so bad1Embed
