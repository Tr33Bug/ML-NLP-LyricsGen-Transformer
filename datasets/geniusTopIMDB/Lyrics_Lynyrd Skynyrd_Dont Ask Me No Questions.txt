Donâ€™t Ask Me No Questions Lyrics
Well everytime that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got just got to come interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

Well its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinking the best of whiskey and playing in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm going to lose my mind
So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye, that's right

Well, "What's your favorite color?" and "Do you dig the Brothers?" is driving me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well don't you think that when I come home, I just want a little peace of mind
If you want to talk about the business buddy, you're just wasting time

So don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

I said don't ask no stupid questions
And I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishing
Well I guess that'll be okayYou might also likeEmbed
