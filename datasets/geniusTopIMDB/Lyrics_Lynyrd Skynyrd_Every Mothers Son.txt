Every Motherâ€™s Son Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well I've been riding a winning horse, for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder, is this the end of the line
No one should take advantage, of who they are
No man has got it made
If he thinks he does, he's wrong

[Chorus]
Every mother's son, better hear what I say
Every mother's son, will rise and fall someday
[Verse 2]
I've seen it happen so many times, so many times before
Some man's got so much money, he doesn't worry no more
Or he's got such a pretty woman, that'll treat him fine
Well my friend has been a fool
It happens everytime

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm not trying to preach to no one, to no one at all
I've seen so many of my good friends, just rise to fall
'Cause they got so much money, or a woman so fine
Well my friends have all been fools, it happens every time

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What I say

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What I say
Oh, every mother's son will rise and fall somedayYou might also like1Embed
