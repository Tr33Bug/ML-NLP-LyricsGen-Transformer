Four Walls of Raiford Lyrics
Well them four walls of Raiford, closing in on me
Doing three to five hard labor, for armed robbery
I had two years behind, but I could not wait the time
Every time I thought about it, well I died some more inside
And I had stripes on my back, memories that hurt
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt
Digging ditches for the chain gang, sleeping in the cold
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more

And I coming home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on this soldier
From the Florida-Georgia line
When they find me they must kill me
Oh Jesus save my soul
I can't go back down to Raiford
I can't take that anymore
Well these last few years behind me
Oh Lord, have been so sad
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad
Now they say I'm guilty, when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime
Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me
I had a pretty wife awaiting and two kids I had to feed
Well I'm one of America's heroes and when they shoot me down
Won't fly old Glory proudly, put my medals in the ground
