Georgia Peaches Lyrics
Well, you can see her walking down on Peach tree Street
She got high-heeled shoes and a dot on her cheek
She's looking good, she's headed downtown
Ain't got no money, honey
She knows her way around
I think she's cute, think she's cute as she can be
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach
Well these Georgia Peaches
Son they know their way around
They can take your money, son before you get sight of town
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach
Well, peaches, peaches. Love them Georgia Peaches 
Well them Georgia Peaches
Sure do got the style
They'll steal your heart with a Southern smile
Well they talk a little funny, but they look so fine
The older they get, I swear its like good wine
I think they're cute, think they're cute as they can be
Talking about a funny talking, honk-tonking Georgia Peach 
I just seem to fall in love with the wrong thingsYou might also likeEmbed
