Gimme Back My Bullets Lyrics[Verse 1]
Life is so strange when it's changing, yes indeed
Well I've seen the hard times and the pressure's been on me
But I keep on working like the working man do
And I've got my act together, going to walk all over you

[Chorus]
Gimme back my bullets
Put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around cause I done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done
Gimme back my bullets
[Verse 2]
Sweet talking people done ran me out of town
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around
But I'm leaving this game one step ahead of you
And you will not hear me cry because I do not sing the blues

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Been up and down since I turned seventeen
Well I've been on top, and then it seems I lost my dream
But I got it back, I'm feeling better everyday
Tell all those pencil pushers, better get out of my way
