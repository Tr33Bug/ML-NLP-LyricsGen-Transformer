Gimme Back My Bullets Lyrics
Life is so strange when it's changing, yes indeed
Well I've seen the hard times and the pressure's been on me
But I keep on working like the working man do
And I've got my act together, going to walk all over you

Gimme back my bullets
Put 'em back where they belong
Ain't fooling around cause I done had my fun
Ain't gonna see no more damage done
Gimme back my bullets
Sweet talking people done ran me out of town
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around
But I'm leaving this game one step ahead of you
And you will not hear me cry because I do not sing the blues


Been up and down since I turned seventeen
Well I've been on top, and then it seems I lost my dream
But I got it back, I'm feeling better everyday
Tell all those pencil pushers, better get out of my way
