Gimme Three Steps Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
What you trying to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"
I said, "Excuse me"
[Verse 2]
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, and mean, and
Big and bad, Lord, a-pointing that gun at me
"Oh wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble with you
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

[Chorus]
"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
For sure"

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you, son, well, it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well he turned and there screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door
You might also like[Chorus]
"Oh won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see-a me no more
Show me the back door"3Embed
