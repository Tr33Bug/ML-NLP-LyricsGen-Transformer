God & Guns Lyrics[Verse 1]
Last night I heard this politician
Talking 'bout his brand new mission
Liked his plans, but they came undone when he got around with God and guns
I don't know how he grew up
But it sure wasn't down at the hunting club
Cause if it was he'd understand a little bit more about the working man

[Chorus]
God and guns
Keep us strong
That's what this country
Was founded on
Well we might as well give up and run
If we let them take our God and guns
[Verse 2]
I'm here in my back of the woods
Where God is great and guns are good
You really can't know that much about 'm
If you think we're better off without 'm
Well there was a time we ain't forgot
You caressed all night with the doors unlocked
But there ain't nobody save no more
So you say your prayers and you thank the lord
For that peace maker
In the Dresser Drawer

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeaaa
Ooh
God and guns
Don't let 'm take
Don't you let 'm take
Don't let 'm take
Our God and guns

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Wohoho
God and guns
Wohohoo
