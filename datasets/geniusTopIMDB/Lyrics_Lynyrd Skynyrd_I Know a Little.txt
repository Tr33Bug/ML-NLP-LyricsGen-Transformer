I Know a Little Lyrics[Intro]
Yes sir

[Verse 1]
Well, the bigger the city, well, the brighter the lights
The bigger the dog, well, the harder the bite
I don't know where you been last night
But I think, mama, you ain't doin' right

[Chorus]
Say I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby, I can guess the rest
[Verse 2]
Well now I don't read that daily news
'Cause it ain't hard to figure where people get the blues
They can't dig what they can't use
If they stick to themselves they'd be much less abused

[Chorus]
Say I know a little
Lord, I do know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby, I can guess the rest

[Bridge]
Play me a little, oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, if you want me to be your only man
Said listen up, mama, teach you all I can
Do right, baby, by your man
Don't worry, mama, teach you all I can

[Chorus]
Say I know a little
Lord, I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby, I can guess the rest
You might also like[Outro]
Well, I know a little about love
Baby, I want your bestEmbed
