I Need You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ain't no need to worry
There ain't no use to cry
'Cause I'll be coming home soon
To keep you satisfied
You know I get so lonely
That I feel I can't go on
And it feels so good inside, babe
Just to call you on the telephone
And I said
[Chorus]
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby, I need you
I miss you more everyday

[Verse 2]
I woke up early this morning
And the sun came shining down
And it found me wishin' and a-hopin'
Mama, you could be around
Well you know that I need you
More than the air I breathe
And I guess I'm just trying to tell you woman
Oh, what you mean to me, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby, I need you
I miss you more everyday
What I say

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm tryin' to tell you I love you
In each and every way
I'm tryin' to tell you I need you
Much more than just a piece of leg
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh baby, I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need you
I miss you more every day

Ooh baby I love, love, love, love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need your sweet lovin'
I miss you more, more every day yeah
Ooh baby I love you
Baby I need you5Embed
