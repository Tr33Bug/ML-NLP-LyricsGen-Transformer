I’m a Country Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]
New York City is a thousand miles away
And if you ask me, I'll tell you that's okay
Well I'm not trying to put the Big Apple down
They don't need a man like me in town
Well I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
I work all day, just trying to make a dime
But that's all right, that's okay by me
Cause that's the way that it was meant to be

[Chorus]
Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be
[Verse 2]
I don't like smoke choking up my air
And some of those city folks well they don't care
I don't like cars buzzing around
I don't even want a piece of concrete in my town
I like sunshine, fresh clean air
Makes me feel like you wouldn't care but
That's all right, each to his own
But one smell from the city
And this country boy is gone
I said

[Chorus]
Big city, hard times don't bother me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

Well, I don't wanna even read about it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you something, let me tell you true
What's right for me, might not be right for you
Well, you live your way, I'll live mine
And I hope that you're happy all the time
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
I work all day trying to make a dime
But that's all right, that's okay by me
Because that's the way that it was supposed to be
You might also like[Chorus]
Big city, hard times, never bothered me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

[Bridge]
Let me tell you, I said

[Chorus]
Big city, hard times, never bothered me
I'm a country boy, I'm as happy as I can be

[Outro]
Ooh, that's my way, baby
I don't want you to even tell me about the big city
I don't wanna read about itEmbed
