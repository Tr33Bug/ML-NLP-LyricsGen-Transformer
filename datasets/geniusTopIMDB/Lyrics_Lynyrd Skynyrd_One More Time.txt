One More Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
How can you stand there smiling
After all you've done?
You know, it seems to make you happy
When you've hurt someone
Twice before, you fooled me
With your deceiving and lying
Come in and close the door one more time
One more time

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you've been gone so long
No one knows where
And you say that you still love me
Then show me you care
'Cause you got what it takes, sweet mama
To make a man feel fine
So I'll take the word of a liar one more time
One more time
[Chorus]
Girl, you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
Get burned every time
Yes, I'm a fool for you, baby, I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love one more time
One more time

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Girl, you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
I get burned every time
Yes, I'm a fool for you, mama, but I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love one more time
One more time

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm her fool once more
I can read her brown eyes
But when the rooster crows tomorrow
Well, it's her turn to cry
I'm headed down that old road
She lost her free ride
So tonight I'll take what I paid for one more time
One more time
