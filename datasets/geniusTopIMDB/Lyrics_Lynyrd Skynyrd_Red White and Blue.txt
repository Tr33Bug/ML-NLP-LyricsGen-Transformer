Red White and Blue Lyrics
We don't have no plastic L.A. friends
We aren't on the edge of no popular trends
Have never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We don't care if your a lawyer, or a Texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass at some liquor stand
But if you got soul, we hang out with people just like you

And my hair's turning white, my neck's always been red, my collar's still blue
We've always been here, just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say, we've always been red white and blue
We ride our own bikes to Sturgis
Pay our own dues
Smoking Camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where I've been, just look at my hands
Yeah I've driven by the White House, spent some time in jail
Mama cried all night but she still wouldn't pay my bail
I have been no angel, but even God he understands!


Well my Daddy worked hard, and so have I
We payed our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country
So what are they complaining about?
Yeah, we love our families, we love our kids
Don't you know its love that makes us all so rich
That's where it's at, if they don't like it they can just, get the Hell out!
