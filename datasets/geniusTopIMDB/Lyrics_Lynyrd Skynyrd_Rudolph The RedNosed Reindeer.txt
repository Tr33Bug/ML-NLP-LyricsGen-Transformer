Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer Lyrics[Intro]
You know there's Dasher and Dancer
Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

[Verse 1]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
[Chorus]
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

[Verse 2]
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Hey, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"You might also likeEmbed
