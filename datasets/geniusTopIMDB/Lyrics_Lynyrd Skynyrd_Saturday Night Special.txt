Saturday Night Special Lyrics
Two feets, they come a creepin'
Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin' naked
A creeper think he got nothin' to lose

So he creeps into this house, yeah
And unlocks the door
An' as the man's reaching for his trousers
He shoots him full of 38 holes
Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

Big Jim's been drinking whiskey
And playing poker on a losing night
An' pretty soon, Ol' Jim starts a-thinkin'
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
So Big Jim commence to fighting
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes

Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

Hmm, and that's the Saturday Night Special
For twenty dollars, you can buy yourself one, too
Here it come
You might also like
Oh, lemme tell you all about it

Hand guns are made for killing
They ain't no good for nothing else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself

So why don't we dump 'em, people, to the bottom of the sea?
Before some old fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you, or me

Mister Saturday Night Special
You got a barrel that's blue and cold
You ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

It's a Saturday Night Special
And I'd like to tell you what you can do with it, too
And that's the end of this song5Embed
