Searching Lyrics[Intro]
I asked the wiseman one sunny day
Can you help me find my way
You're so much older and wiser too
Would you help me mr wiseman
I'm feeling blue
Oh I'm not satisfied

[Verse 1]
He said you're not doing too bad, no not bad at all
You're just trying to walk son, before you can crawl
You got stacks of money to the sky up above
Now all you need is to find you a love
[Chorus]
He sent me searching to find my love
He sent me searching to the Lord up above
He sent me searching just to find the morning dove
And she'll tell you where to find your love
Oh mr wiseman, I need to find my love

[Verse 2]
You can have anything in this god's world
But you won't be happy son, 'til you find a girl
Now you can be happy boy, if you try
Find a woman son, and you'll be satisfied

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Oh Lord, he sent me searchingYou might also like1Embed
