Still Unbroken Lyrics[Verse 1]
Broken bones, broken hearts
Stripped down and torn apart
A little bit of rust - I'm still running
Counting miles, counting tears
Twisted roads, shifting gears
Year after year - it's all or nothing

[Chorus]
But I'm not home, I'm not lost
Still holding on to what I got
Ain't much left
No there's so much that's been stolen
I guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alone, still alive, Still UNBROKEN
I'm still alone, still alive
I'M STILL UNBROKEN
[Verse 2]
Never captured, never tamed
Wild horses on the plains
You can call me lost - I call it FREEDOM
I feel the spirit in my soul
It's something Lord I can't control
I'M NEVER GIVING UP WHILE I'M STILL BREATHING

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Like the wind, like the rain
It's all running through my veins
Like a river pouring down into the ocean
I'm out here on the streets
But I'm standing on my feet
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm still alone
Still alive
Still unbroken
I'm still unbroken
I ain't never going down
I'm still unbroken
