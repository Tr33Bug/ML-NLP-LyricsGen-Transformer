That Ainâ€™t My America Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wanna light up underneath the no-smoking sign
Sometimes I wish they'd tell me, how justice got so blind
I wish they'd just leave me alone cause I'm doing alright
You can take your change on down the road and leave me here with mine

[Chorus]
Cause that ain't my America
That ain't this country's roots
You wanna slam old Uncle Sam
But I ain't letting you
I'm mad as hell and you know I still bleed Red, White, and Blue
That ain't us
That Ain't My America
[Verse 2]
I was standing there in Dallas
Waiting on a plane
I overheard an old man
Tell a young soldier "thanks
The young soldier hung his head and said "it's hard to believe
You're the only one who took the time to say a word to me
And the old man said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's to the women and men who in their hands hold a Bible and a gun
And they ain't afraid of nothing, when when they're holding either one
Now there's kids who can't pray in school
$100 dollar tanks of gas
I can tell you right now this country ain't
AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT
NO
