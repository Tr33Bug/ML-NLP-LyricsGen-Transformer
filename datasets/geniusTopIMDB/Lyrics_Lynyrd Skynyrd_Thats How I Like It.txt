Thatâ€™s How I Like It Lyrics
Let me tell you

Where I come from it's grits and gravy not champagne and caviar
Got pickup trucks, there is no mercedes, that's who we are (Oooooh.. Yeah I wouldn't change a thing)
I am no saint sometimes a sinner and I can't tell you why
But I get up every morning and thank the man above (Oooooh WOOOoo my life is good)
Let me tell ya how good... hahaaa
Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down and old dirt road
That's How I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
There is nothing better than the sound of a crowd
American flag it makes me proud
That's how I like it
Wooooo...aaah... Listen now

There is no cell phone towers, you won't catch me online
Working with my hands for hours, is how I spend my time
And I don't stand in line for coffee, It is not my cup of tea
Out here in the country we got everything we need Ooooh Woooo yeah

Ooooohhhh
WOOooooo That's how I like it
