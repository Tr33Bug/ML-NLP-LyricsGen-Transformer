Thatâ€™s How I Like It Lyrics[Intro]
Let me tell you[?]

[Verse 1]
Where I come from it's grits and gravy not champagne and caviar
Got pickup trucks, there is no mercedes, that's who we are (Oooooh.. Yeah I wouldn't change a thing)
I am no saint sometimes a sinner and I can't tell you why
But I get up every morning and thank the man above (Oooooh WOOOoo my life is good)

Let me tell ya how good... hahaaa
[Chorus]
Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down and old dirt road
That's How I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
There is nothing better than the sound of a crowd
American flag it makes me proud
That's how I like it

Wooooo...aaah... Listen now

[Verse 2]
There is no cell phone towers, you won't catch me online
Working with my hands for hours, is how I spend my time
And I don't stand in line for coffee, It is not my cup of tea
Out here in the country we got everything we need Ooooh Woooo yeah

[Chorus]

Ooooohhhh[?]

WOOooooo That's how I like it

[Whistle]
