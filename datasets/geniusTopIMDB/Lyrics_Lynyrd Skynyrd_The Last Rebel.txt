The Last Rebel Lyrics[Verse]
There's a grey horse standing still
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
The rain pours off his hat
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes
Now the cannons are silent
His friends are all gone, gotta put it all behind him
If he ever wants to find his way home
He's the last rebel on the road
Just a boy with his old guitar
Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong
But he carried on, got a dream that will never die
Can't change him
No use in staying where you don't belong
Now he's rolling down the highway
Gone too far too fast
No one will ever find him
He'll never look back
[Chorus]
Because he's the last rebel
And he's all alone, He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel, the last rebel on the road

[Bridge]
There'll never be another like him
He's the last of a dying breed
Ain't no use trying to change him

[Chorus]
Because he's the last rebel
And he's all alone, He's the last rebel
His friends are all gone
He's the last rebel, the last rebel on the roadYou might also likeEmbed
