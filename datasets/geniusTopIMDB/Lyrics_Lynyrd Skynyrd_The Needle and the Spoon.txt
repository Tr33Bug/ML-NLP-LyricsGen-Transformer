The Needle and the Spoon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Thirty days, Lord and thirty nights
I'm coming home on an airplane flight
Mama waiting at the ticket line
Tell me son why do you stand there crying

[Chorus]
It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away, took me away
[Verse 2]
I've been feeling so sick inside
Got to get better, lord before I die
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said
You better quit, son before you're dead

[Chorus]
Quit the needle. quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
We're going to take you away. Lord, we going to take you away
It was the needle and the spoon

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again, Lord I've seen a lot of fools
Well, I hope you people, Lord can hear what I say
You'll have your chance to hit it some day

[Chorus]
Don't mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
It'll take you away

[Outro]
Lord, they gonna bury you boy
Don't mess with the needle
Now I know, I know, I know, I know, I knowYou might also like3Embed
