Things Goin’ On Lyrics
Well, have you ever lived down in the ghetto?
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream
Because there's things going on that you don't know

Too many lives they've spent across the ocean
Too much money been spent upon the moon
Well, until they make it right
I hope they never sleep at night
They better make some changes and do it soon
Do it now, do it to it

Well they're going ruin the air that we breathe
Lord have mercy
They're gonna ruin us all, by and by
I'm telling all you beware
I don't think they really care
I think they just sit up there
And just get high

Have you ever lived down in that ghetto?
And have you ever felt that cold wind blow?
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream
'Cause there's things going on that you don't know
Well if you don't know what I mean
Won't you stand up and scream
'Cause there's things going on that you don't know

Tell it
Tell it, tell it
