Tuesdayâ€™s Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Train roll on
On down the line, won't you
Please take me far away?

Now I feel the wind blow
Outside my door, it means I'm
I'm leavin' my woman
At home
Lord and
[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind again

[Verse 2]
And I don't know
Oh where I'm goin'
I just want to be
Left alone

Well, when this train ends
I'll try again, alright
I'm leavin' my woman
At home
Lord and

[Chorus]
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind
Train roll on, Tuesday's gone

A-many miles from my home, see I'm
