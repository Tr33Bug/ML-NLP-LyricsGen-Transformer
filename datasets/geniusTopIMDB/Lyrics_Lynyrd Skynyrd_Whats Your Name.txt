Whatâ€™s Your Name Lyrics
Well, its eight o'clock in Boise
Idaho
I'll find my limo driver
Mister, take us to the show
I done made some plans for
Later on tonight
I'll find a little queen, and
I know I can treat her right

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same?
Back at the hotel
Lord, we got such a mess
It seems that one of the crew
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar
What a shame
Won't you come upstairs, girl
And have a drink of champagne?

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Well, there ain't no shame
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same? Oh, yeah


What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same?
You might also like
Nine o'clock the next day
And I'm ready to go
I got six hundred miles to ride
To do one more show, oh no
Can I get you a taxi home?
It sure was grand
When I come back here next year
I wanna see you again

What was your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Well, there ain't no shame
What was name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl
Won't you do the same? Woo2Embed
