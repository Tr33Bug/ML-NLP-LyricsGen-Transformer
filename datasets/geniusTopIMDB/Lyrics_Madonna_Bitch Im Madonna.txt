TranslationsPortuguêsBitch I’m Madonna Lyrics
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're gonna love this
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can't touch this
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause I'm a bad bitch

We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us
I just wanna have fun tonight (Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight (Gonna blow up)


We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna

Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna

We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show
You might also like
I just wanna go up tonight
Pull me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight (Gon' blow up)

Uhh
Beep-beep, bitch, move

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna

You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?

Uh, poured up with my nose up and that rose up in that thinga
I'm froze up with my stove up 'cause he eating like it's his dinner
I run shit, I don't fall back 'cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got 'em awestruck, it's not a toss-up, I'm the winner
Beep-beep, bitch move, 'fore I bang-bang with that Uzi
That's Miu Miu on my shoes, ain't got a thing left for me to prove (Uh)
It's that bottle service all night, it's that pop and urban just right
It's that "go hard or go home" zone, bitch
I'm Madonna, these hoes know

We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna

We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are?
