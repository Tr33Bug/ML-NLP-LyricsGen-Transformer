TranslationsPortuguÃªsCome Alive Lyrics
I'm in the sky where I oughta be at, I've been watching you
Rocket ship takin' off in that, now I'm onto you
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

They say be all I can be
And all I want is peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's dreams
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream's real, it's alive
Come alive, come on

I can't react how you thought I'd react, I would never for you
Front line, I won't stand in the back, 'cause you want me to
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

They say be all I can be
And all I want is peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's dreams

Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream's real, it's alive
Come alive, come on
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come on
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come on
