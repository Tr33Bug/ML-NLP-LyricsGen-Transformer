TranslationsPortuguêsCrazy Lyrics
I spent all night waitin' up
It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong you're tryna make good

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Peel off my weakness, layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep 'round
I'm a force and I won't tame, babe
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I've seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you
You might also like
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

Eu te amo
Mas não deixo você me destruir
I put you on a pedestal, but statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the wall
Played the hand you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name
(Forget your name) Mmm

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy (Crazy)
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca (Louca)
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca15Embed
