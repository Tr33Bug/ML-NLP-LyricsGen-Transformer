TranslationsPortuguêsDie Another Day Lyrics
I'm gonna wake up, yes and no
I'm gonna kiss some part of
I'm gonna keep this secret
I'm gonna close my body now

I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day

Sigmund Freud
Analyse this
Analyse this
Analyse this, this, this, this, this

I'm gonna break the cycle
I'm gonna shake up the system
I'm gonna destroy my ego
I'm gonna close my body now

Uh
Uh

I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go
For every sin, I'll have to pay
A time to work, a time to play
I think I'll find another way
It's not my time to go
You might also like
I'm gonna avoid the cliché
I'm gonna suspend my senses
I'm gonna delay my pleasure
I'm gonna close my body now

I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go

Uh
Uh
I need to lay down

I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
