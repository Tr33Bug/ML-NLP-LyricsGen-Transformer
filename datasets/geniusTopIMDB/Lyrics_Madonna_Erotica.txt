Erotica, romance
Erotica, romance
My name is Dita, I'll be your mistress tonight
I'd like to put you in a trance
If I take you from behind, push myself into your mind
When you least expect it, will you try and reject it?
If I'm in charge, and I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild, let my mouth go where it wants to?
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance, all over

Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic

Once you put your hand in the flame, you can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction, in a little bit of pain
I can see you understand, I can tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, well, rise above
I only hurt the ones I love
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance, all over
You might also like

Put your hands all over my body

I don't think you know what pain is
I don't think you've gone that way
I could bring you so much pleasure
I'll come to you when you say
I know you want me (I'm not gonna hurt you)
I'm not gonna hurt you
Just close your eyes
