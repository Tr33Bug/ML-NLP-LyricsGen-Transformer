TranslationsPortuguÃªsGirl Gone Wild Lyrics
Oh my God (God)
I am heartly sorry for having offended thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of Heaven (Heaven)
And the pain of Hell (Hell)
But most of all, because I love thee (Thee)
And I want so badly to be good (Good, good, good, good, good)

It's so hypnotic (Hypnotic)
The way he pulls on me
It's like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
It's so erotic (Erotic)
This feeling can't be beat
It's coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

The room is spinning (Spinning)
It must be the Tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning (Sinning)
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favorite song
Turn me on
You might also like
I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl anyway, hey
Forgive me
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild5Embed
