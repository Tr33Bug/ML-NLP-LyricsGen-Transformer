TranslationsPortuguêsI Don’t Give A Lyrics
Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

You were so mad at me
Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup
Make a film, write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press, buy the dress
All of this to impress
RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row
You might also like
I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track?
I'm moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure, I don't give a
(I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a, I-I-I don't
I don't give a)

Shots fire!
Anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire!
You don't hear them bums on nothing, that's fire!
Tell 'em, "catch fire"
In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
Ayo Madonna (Yes, Nicki?)
Mi yuh say you original, Don Dada
Inna ya Gabbana, inna all ya Prada!
We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
Pops collar!
See, I really can't relate to your Volvo
And you can't get these shoes at the Aldo
When I let a dude go, that's his loss
I was cutting them checks, I was his boss!
Yo, I don't give a F you, curse nor bless you
Never let 'em stress you, yo
I ain't a businesswoman, I'm a business, woman!
And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman
I'm gonna be okay (Mama)
I don't care what the people say (Madonna!)
I'm gonna be alright (Nicki Minaj!)
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right
I'm moving fast, can you follow my track? (Let's go)
I'm moving fast and I like it like that (Catch up)
I do ten things all at once (Mama)
And if you have a problem, I don't give a

There's only one queen and that's Madonna
