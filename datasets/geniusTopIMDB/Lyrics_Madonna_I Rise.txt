TranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisI Rise Lyrics
Us kids don't know what we're talking about
That we're too young to understand how the government works
We call B.S.

I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it
I can't break down now
I can't take that now
Died a thousand times
Managed to survive
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)
I rise, I rise
I rise up above it, up above it
I rise, I rise
I rise up above it all

There's nothin' you can do to me that hasn't been done
Not bulletproof, shouldn't have to run from a gun
River of tears ran dry, let 'em run
No game that you can play with me, I ain't won

'Cause I'm goin' through it, yeah
I know you see the tragic in it (Alright)
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (Yeah)
I can't break down now
I can't take that now (I can't take that now)
Died a thousand times
Managed to survive (I managed to survive)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it, up above it
(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it all

I managed to survive
(B.S.)
Freedom's what you choose to do with what's been done to you
No one can hurt you now unless you want them to
(Unless you want)
No one can hurt you now unless you love 'em too (B.S.)
Unless you love 'em too

'Cause I'm going through it
Yeah, I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (Magic in it)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it, up above it
(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it all

Yeah, we gonna rise up (I will rise)
Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yes, we can, we can get it together (I will rise)
We'll rise up, we can get it together
Yeah, we gonna rise up (I will rise)
Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yes, we can, we can get it together (I will rise)
We'll rise up, we can get it together19Embed
