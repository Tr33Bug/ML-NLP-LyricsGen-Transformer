TranslationsPortuguÃªsVeni Vidi Vici Lyrics
Madonna, life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes, y'know?

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

(Talk to 'em, talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (Music saved my life)

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (What you did?)
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Uh) (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door (What?)
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers (murdered, murdered, murdered)
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trapper (trapper), any rapper (rapper)
Any politician, beautician, or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, either that or jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from
I was fearless like a renegade (Try to tell 'em)
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered
