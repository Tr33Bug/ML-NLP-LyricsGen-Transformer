Dawn Patrol Lyrics
Thermal count is rising
In perpetual writhing
The primordial ooze
And the sanity they lose
Awakened in the morning
To more air pollution warnings
Still we sleepwalk off to work
While our n-n-n-nervous systems jerk

Pretending not to notice
How history had forebode us
With the greenhouse in effect
Our environment was wrecked
Now I can only laugh
As I read our epitaph
We end our lives as moles
In the dark of dawn patrolYou might also like6Embed
