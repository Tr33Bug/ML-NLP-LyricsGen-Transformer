Last Rites / Loved to Deth Lyrics



Wow!
Whoa!
Your body's empty now as I hold you
Now you're gone, I miss you, but I told you
I remember bad times more than good
There's no coming back even if we could

I loved you to death
I loved you to death

If I can't have you, then no one will
And since I won't, I'll have to kill
My only love, something I've never felt
Now you've gone to Heaven
And I'll burn in Hell!

I loved you to death
I loved you to death

I, loved you, to death
I, loved you, to death
Whoa!
You might also like

*Laughter*

Oh, and now I'm down below, what do I see?
You didn't go to Heaven, you're down in Hell with me

And now you're coming back, "Baby, take me please"
I really think I would if you weren't such a sleaze
I loved you once, before you kept me on a string
I'd rather go without than take what you would bring

I loved you to death!
Whoa!1Embed
