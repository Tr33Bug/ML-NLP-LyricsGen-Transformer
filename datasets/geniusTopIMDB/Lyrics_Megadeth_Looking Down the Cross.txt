Looking Down the Cross Lyrics

Woah-oh, yeah
Now before they take me and my blessed life
Now you'll know why Deth was summoned here tonight
I'll recall my perils; they'll kill me in pride
No, I can't run away; there's no place to hide
Whoa-oh...

Though too much to live for, I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation, my death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt, the altar they've built; high priests of sin
Destiny, fate, the wicked one's gate beckoning you in
Beckoning you in

Down the walkways, through the blood-stained town
Looking down the cross, bleeding from the crown
Led to stay, to die beside the thieves
Kill the king of the world to be

And now to you, this will come a putrefying pestilence
More noxious than the serpent's breath, malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of Choronzon
More disease than the wind of the moonlight sun
Putrefaction you have caused, no need for confession

Now you wish you had a god to stop your demolition
Crushing the bones of the hundred-folds
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man, woman, child, no one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner

And this was all you got, so don these broken wings
The sands of time run out, bells of Hades ring
Is this a nightmare to unhallow thy name?
Smell of brimstone dancing in the flames
No help now as you fulfill his task
Chief of evil has got you by the ass
Set free to sit upon the throne
Just a dream? You're weeping all alone!

Looking down the cross, speak no evil
I'm looking down the cross, speak no evil
Looking down the cross, speak no evil
I'm looking down the cross, speak no evil
Whoa-oh-oh...2Embed
