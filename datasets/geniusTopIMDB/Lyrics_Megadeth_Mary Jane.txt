Mary Jane Lyrics
"Forgive me father, for I have sinned
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind...
And I'm still wide awake"
Mary Jane!

From the earth, up through the trees
I can hear her calling me
Her voice rides on the breeze
Oh, it's haunting me
No, can't get away
No, there's no escape (I'm going crazy)
If I know I'm going crazy
I must not be insane

(Ooh, hoo hoo)

Beware, my friends, as you pass by
As you are now, so once was I
As I'm now, so you must be
Prepare, my friends, to follow me

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
Fingers gripped around my brain
No control, my mind is lame
I'm in the astral plane, and I'll never be the same
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never

Beware, my friends, as you pass by
As you are now, so once was I
As I'm now, so you must be
Prepare, my friends, to follow me
You might also like
It hurts so bad
I can't breathe
Prepare to follow meEmbed
