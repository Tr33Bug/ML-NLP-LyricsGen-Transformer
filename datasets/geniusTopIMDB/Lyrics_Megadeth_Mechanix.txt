Mechanix Lyrics
Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car

Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!

We were shifting gears hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end, you know it feels too slow

Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!


I'm giving you my room service
And you know it's more than enough
Oh, one more time, you know I'm in love
You might also like
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life; fuck yeah!
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!
Huh!

Hahahahaha!

Yeah!4Embed
