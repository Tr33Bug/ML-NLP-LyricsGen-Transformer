The Conjuring Lyrics
Welcome to our sanguinary sect of worship
Feel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathematise all those who oppose us

Don't summon the Devil, don't call the priests
If you need the strength, the conjuring
Obey!


Behold, the flames rise from the compass' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil, and with the ashes you'll anoint

Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician
Light the candles, place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place the lash from a black cat's eye
A straw of a broom, fold, and burn, and centralize

Don't summon the Devil, don't call the priests
If you need the strength, then conjure me


I am the Devil's advocate
A salesman if you will
You know my name, you know my name

I met your father years ago
I gave him what he'd please
He called my name, and you'll do the same
You might also like
I'm claiming what is mine by right
It's time to close the deal
You're bought and sold, bought and sold

Come join me in my infernal depths
Mephisto's hall of fame
I've got your soul, I've got your soul

The conjuring
Obey!4Embed
