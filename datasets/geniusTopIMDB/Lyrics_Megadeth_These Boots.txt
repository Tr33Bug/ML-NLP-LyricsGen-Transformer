These Boots Lyrics
You keep sayin' you got somethin' for me
Somethin' you call love, but I call sex
You've been kissin' when you ought-a-be screwin'
And now someone else can kiss your ass

These boots are made for walkin', and that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You been lyin' and there ain't no believin'
And you keep sayin' what you want in the bed
You been stayin' when you ought-a-be-a leavin'
And what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walkin', that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you


You keep dressin' ways you shouldn't be dressin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned, ha!
I just found me a brand-new box spring mattress
What? You know, bitch, you got a lot to learn

These boots are made for walkin', and that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna stomp all over you
Yeah!

Are you ready, boots?
Are you ready, boots?
Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin'

And you think I'm kiddin', don'tcha?Embed
