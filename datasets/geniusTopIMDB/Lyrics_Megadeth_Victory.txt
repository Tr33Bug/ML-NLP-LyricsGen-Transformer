Victory Lyrics
Now one day I started telling everyone that
"Killing Is My Business" and I was hung like a martyr
For "Looking Down the Cross," my "Skull Beneath the Skin"
Prophesied "Last Rites, Loved to Death," my friends
Then I started seeing "Bad Omens" in my head
"Good Mourning, Black Friday," will I "Wake Up Dead"?
If "I Ain't Superstitious," then this won't mean a thing
But some crazy shit has happened since "The Conjuring"

Not even close, not even close
Not even close to overdose!
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Came "Anarchy" to "Set the World Afire"
Pain of "Hook in Mouth," "In My Darkest Hour"
Corruption of the world, "Peace Sells, nobody's Buying"
Ignorant religion, "Holy Wars," and the dying
"Tornado" nearly got me by the "Skin o' My Teeth"
"This Was My Life," "Foreclosure of My Dreams"
May the past "Rust in Peace" in "Hangar 18"
And "Countdown to Extinction" just be a bad dream
"Lucretia" said

Not even close, not even close
Not even close to overdose!

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory

Not even close, not even close
Not even close to overdose!

Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes, had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart, I am a victory2Embed
