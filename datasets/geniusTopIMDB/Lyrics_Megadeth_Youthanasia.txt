Youthanasia Lyrics
Who'd believe with the way things are here?
We'd be goin' anywhere telling people how to live
Who'd believe we'd spend more shippin' drugs and guns than to educate our sons?
Sorry, but that's what they did

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Oh, I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me
Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things
I've stepped over lots of bodies on my way
Thanks for the information, don't need no more anything

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Oh, I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We run for youthanasia7Embed
