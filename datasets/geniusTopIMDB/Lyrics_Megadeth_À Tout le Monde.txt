À Tout le Monde Lyrics
Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans, denied

So, as you read this, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred

À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free


So, as you read, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone, that's all
You might also like
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
