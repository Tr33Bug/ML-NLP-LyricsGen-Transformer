Blackened Lyrics
Blackened is the end, winter, it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth, never her rebirth
Evolution's end, never will it mend
Never

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of Earth, terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill, nothing left to kill
Never seen before, breathing nevermore
Never

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

Blackened!

Smoldering decay, take her breath away
Millions of our years, in minutes, disappears
Darkening in vain, decadence remains
All is said and done, never is the sun
Never

Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened
