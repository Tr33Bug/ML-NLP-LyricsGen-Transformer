Hero of the Day Lyrics
Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?
Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns (The window burns)
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?
You might also like
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they try
Mama, they try and break me (Mama, they try and break me)
Mama, they try and break me (Mama, they try and break me)
Mama, they try and break me (Mama, they try and break me)
Mama, they try
Mama, they try...4Embed
