Leper Messiah Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three, four, one

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown

Please, please, spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees, knees, falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah

Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain

Chain, chain, join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, fame, infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power, we see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah

Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
You might also like

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie11Embed
