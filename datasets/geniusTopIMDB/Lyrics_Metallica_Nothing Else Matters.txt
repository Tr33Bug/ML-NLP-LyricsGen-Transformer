So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are

And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view

And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are

And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
You might also like

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say

And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view

And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are

No, nothing else matters
