Now That We’re Dead Lyrics
When darkness falls, may it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain, may it be
It’s all we’ve ever known
When flame consumes, may it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won, may it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever2Embed
