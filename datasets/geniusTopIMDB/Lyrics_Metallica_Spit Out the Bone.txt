Spit Out the Bone Lyrics
Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought 'cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within

Disappear like man was never here
Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

Plug into me, I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate
Accelerate, utopian solution
Finally cure the Earth of man
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution
Set on course a master plan

Reinvent the earth inhabitant

Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone
You might also like
The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machined the new divine


Stop breathing and dedicate to me
Stop dreaming and terminate for me
All meaning you dedicate to me
All feelings you terminate for me


Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah11Embed
