TranslationsPortuguÃªsNederlandsThe God That Failed Lyrics
Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Not the word, not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds (It feeds)
It grows (It grows)
It clouds all you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

Find your peace, find your say
Find the smooth road on your way
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds (It feeds)
It grows (It grows)
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed, yeah

Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

Follow the god that failed, yeah
Broken is the promise
Betrayal, betrayal, yeah11Embed
