Alwayz Into Somethin Lyrics
Ninteen-ninety-mothafucking-one
N.W.A back in this mothafucker, yo
Takin' out all you commercialized-ass niggas
And we're on this laid back track
And we're doin' this one kinda smooth
So whatcha gonna do, Dre? - Kick it!

And so on, let the shit flow on
Because I need somethin' to go off on
The mothafuckin' D-R-E servin' a death wish
So I'mma hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the B-en-z
I got 44 ways of gettin' paid
Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To scoop up Ren, I heard shots
1, 2, 3, then I seen a nigga
Hoppin' the fence and it was Ren on the mothafuckin' trigger
He got in the Benz and said
"Dre, I was speakin' to yo' bitch O'Shea”
And as we roll on, I seen the patroller creep
So we got ghost before they peeped
Me and Ren in a black CE, yo
Bumpin' some funky shit by the D.O.C
I gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see
I got a have it if I'm not paid thoroughly
I start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'
Ba-ba-ba-ba! Fuck the mothafuckin' police cause they push that black man down and they kick him in his mothafuckin' balls. Goddamn police, fuck them! Come down, MC Ren

I heard a dope beat, somebody told me that Buck did it
But if Dre didn't do it I can't fuck with it
N.W.A is like a mix a fix a trix
Real niggas with big dicks
You're takin' a chance when you think that
Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit, ain’t shit but a killin'
For a nigga labeled as bein' a mothafuckin' villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
How so many prayed I'd be a mothafuckin' failure
Real niggas gotta have top rankin'
I hooked up with three more niggas and started makin'
Funky-ass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you don't want a confrontation
Real niggas don't play
Yella, Eazy, me, and the nigga nigga Dre
Yo, always makin' sure that my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'

Boom-boom! Look at that bitch walking down the mothafuckin' street
Now she know the Admiral wanna hold my dick in
Because that bitch’s booty is so na-na-na-na-na-na-nasty
You might also like
Yeah, the world's most dangerous group
Definitely in this mothafucka
Sendin' a shout-out to all the bitches out there
Yo, you can get the pick up to suck a dick up 'til you hiccup
You know what I'm sayin'

Yo, cause I'm a nigga for life
And I really don't give a fuck
I'm goin' for mine, every time
I see a fuckin' softy, punk strong as coffee
A nigga like that best to back up off me
Yo, cause these are the days and the times of the real niggas
False niggas, end up as tossed niggas
And that's on the real, cause I'm a nigga that kills
Again and again, so tell 'em what's up Ren

If I'm not into nothin', I don't feel right
So I grab the nine and the clip and go and murder mothafuckas at night
Because I'm startin' to fiend, from sittin' in a cell
Where the crime was too tragic I couldn't make bail
So now they gotta hold me
And listen to rehabilitation over and over, sayin' they told me
But I don't give a fuck cuz I know my shit is pumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'
1991 and N.W.A get the job done
Admiral Dancehall gonna sing this little tale 'bout a girl that's quick fi lick me dick, it goes something like this....
Da girl quick fi lickin' me dick, da girl quick fi lickin' me dick
Da girl quick fi lickin' me dick, she got a dirty habit
