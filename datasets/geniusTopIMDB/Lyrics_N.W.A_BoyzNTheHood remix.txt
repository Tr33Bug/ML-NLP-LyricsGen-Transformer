Boyz-N-The-Hood (remix) LyricsCruisin' down the street in my 64'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA
'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' shit
Donald B in the place to give me the pace
He said, My man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead, L.A. Times, front page
'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball, my breath start stinkin'
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left, I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb h*** says somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid *** by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin *** wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the h***
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross, cold knocked him out
'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' ***
I'm rollin' hard now, I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 'round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a u, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time
'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' ***
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the County Jail
Two days later in Municipal Court
Kilo G on trial, cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire, then came Suzy
The *** came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
'Coz the boyz-n-the-hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy 'coz I ain't sayin' ***You might also likeEmbed
