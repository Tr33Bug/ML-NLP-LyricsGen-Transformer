Chin Check (Extended Version) Lyrics
 911, What are you reporting
 Hello 911, Help me, Help me
 What is your emergency
 There's someone in my house, There's some men in my house
 Can you please verify your address for me
 151 Shenandoah, Shenandoah
 Ma'am where inside the house are you
 (Oh My God)
 Ma'am where inside the house are you
 In my room, they're in my room
 Ma'am calm down, Deputies are on the way
Is the door locked
 (Shriek)
(Shotgun shell chambered, Followed by gunshot)
 Ma'am?
 N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a

(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a) What the fuck's up Dre
You tell me, you talk to Ren
Im right here nigga
(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a) Release the hound
Bow wow wow
Wha wha wha what what what, what

I'm a Nigga Wit an Attitude thanks to y'all
And I don't give a fuck I keep it gangsta y'all
I'mma ride for my side in the C.P.T
God bless the memory of Eazy-E
If it wadn't for me where the fuck you'd be?
Rappin like the Treacherous Three, fuckin cowards
I'd have seen Dre rockin parties for hours
And I'd have seen Ren fuckin bitches from Howard
And I'd have seen Snoop give away Eddie Bauer's
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers

This the shit niggas kill for
They hear the Villain niggas spittin' with them nigga flows
Fuck you hoes, fuck you bitch ass niggas too
Got something for your throat
These niggas wearin' skirts like the pope
Who them niggas that you love to get (us)
Who them niggas that you fuckin' wit' (us)
They be screaming we the shit (what)
The saga continues, with the worlds most dangerous group
Four deep in the coup√©
(It's the Villain)

Cause I'mma nigga 4 life, so I'mma nigga til I diz-ie
(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
I'mma smoke where I wanna smoke (fuck that)
I'mma choke who I wanna choke (fuck that)
(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
I'mma ride where I wanna ride (fuck that)
Cause I'mma nigga 4 life, so I'mma motherfuckin nigga til I diz-ie

A pencil, a pen, or a Glock
Im the original, subliminal, subterranium
Titianium, criminal minded, swift
D-R-E with that fuck a bitch shit (fuck a biatch)
A couple o' notes and get you hog-tied in rope
Dope like tons of coke, cutthroat
You don't want the pistols to whistle
Candy paint Impala
I make hoes pop collars

God damn hoes, here we go again
Fuckin with Ren, playin' to win
(he got the) coke in hand, (I got the) juice and gin
Same shit you was fuckin wit way back then
We keep it crackin' from the actin to the jackin
G'ed up C'ed up motherfucker blaze the weed up
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
I stay on deck so me don't get wet
Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
Let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not?
 Why the fuck not?
 Why the fuck not?
 Why the fuck not?
 Cause I'm tight as the night
I had to wipe activator off the mic, in 1985

(N N, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
Real niggas, biatch, you know, ha hah

We cause tragedy, erratically
Systematically, in your house without a key
How fucked up that'd be
Gat'll be near your anatomy, my form of flattery

Assault and battery, cus we coming with that street mentality
Straight west coast rider academy
Concrete nigga, that's my reality
 We tend to bus' on niggas that get mad at me
 Was it a bitch in the mix
 Well it had to be

Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be
(Yea thats right)
