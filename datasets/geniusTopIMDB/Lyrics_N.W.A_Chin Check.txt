Chin Check Lyrics
What the fuck's up, Dre?

You tell me, you talk to Ren

I'm right here nigga
Release the hound

Bow wow wow
I'm a nigga wit an attitude thanks to y'all
And I don't give a fuck I keep it gangsta y'all
I'mma ride for my side in the C.P.T
God bless the memory of Eazy-E
If it wasn't for me where the fuck you'd be
Rapping like the Treacherous Three, fucking cowards
I'd have seen Dre rocking parties for hours
And I'd have seen Ren fucking bitches from Howard
And I'd have seen Snoop give away Eddie Bauer's
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers

This the shit niggas kill for
They hear the villain niggas spitting with them nigga flows
Fuck you hoes, fuck you bitch-ass niggas too
Got something for you broke
These niggas wearing skirts like the pope
Who them niggas that you love to get
Who them niggas that you fuckin' with
Love to yell that we the shit
The saga continues with the world's most dangerous group
Four deep in the Coupe

I'mma smoke where I wanna smoke, fuck that
I'mma choke who I wanna choke, fuck that
I'mma ride where I wanna ride, fuck that
Cause I'mma nigga for life, so I'mma nigga til I diz-ie
I'mma smoke where I wanna smoke, fuck that
I'mma choke who I wanna choke, fuck that
I'mma ride where I wanna ride, fuck that
Cause I'mma nigga for life, so I'mma nigga til I diz-ie
You might also like
A pencil, a pen, or a Glock
I'm the original, subliminal, subterranean
Titanium, criminal minded, swift
D-R-E with that fuck a bitch shit
A couple of notes and get you hog-tied in rope
Dope like tons of coke, cut-throat
You don't want the pistols to whistle
Candy paint Impala
I make hoes pop collars

God damn hoes, here we go again
Fucking with Ren, playing to win
He got the Coke and Hen - I got the juice and gin
Same shit you was fucking with way back then
We keep it cracking from the acting to the jacking
G'ed up C'ed up motherfucker blaze the weed up
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
I stay on deck so me don't get wet

Look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
Let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not
Why the fuck not
Why the fuck not

Why the fuck not

Cause I'm tight as the night
I had to wipe activator off the mic, in 1985

Real niggas, biatch, you know, ha hah

We cause tragedy, erratically
Systematically in your house without a key
How fucked up that'd be
Gat'll be near your anatomy, my form of flattery

Assault and battery, cause we coming with that street mentality
Straight west coast rider academy
Concrete nigga, that's my reality

We tend to bust on niggas that get mad at me

Was it a bitch in the mix

Well it had to be

Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be

I'mma smoke where I wanna smoke, fuck that
I'mma choke who I wanna choke, fuck that
I'mma ride where I wanna ride, fuck that
Cause I'mma nigga for life, so I'mma nigga til I diz-ie
I'mma smoke where I wanna smoke, fuck that
I'mma choke who I wanna choke, fuck that
I'mma ride where I wanna ride, fuck that
Cause I'mma nigga for life, so I'mma muthafuckin nigga til I diz-ie20Embed
