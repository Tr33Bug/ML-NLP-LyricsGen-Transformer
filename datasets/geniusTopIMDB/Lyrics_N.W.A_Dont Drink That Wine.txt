Donâ€™t Drink That Wine Lyrics
Yo! Bitch, don't you know I'll beat your mother'...
Oh, oh! you
'Ey, what's happenin' everybody?
It's your mayn nigga behind the mothafuckin' trigga, Willy Johnston!
And I'm in front of the liquor store with all the bitches, thieves and dopeheads
And I got my man Edmond Woodrow Jones
Aaand the Johntson Sisters (no relation)
So then put little something together,.. to tell y'all... what's really goin' on!
Mia put this shit on!

Coke would be better, just - it's easy to fiiiind!
If that won't do, - smoke a joint o-or twoo-ooo!
Don't drink that wii-iii-iine! - Woooaahhh, that wii-ii-iine!
