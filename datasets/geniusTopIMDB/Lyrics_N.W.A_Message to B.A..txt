Message to B.A. Lyrics
A message to Benedict Arnold: No matter how hard you try to be, here's what they think about you!


Hello? I was at The Celebrity... and I was wonderin' how that punk Ice Cube got his ass beat by ATL!

Yo! Dat nigga was sayin' he from Compton? He ain't from Compton, he from a planet called: "Punk!" It is full of pussy protein and pearl tongue!

All I wanna know is why y'all let his punk-ass in the group in the first place, when you knew what kinda bitch he was?

Yeah, I was in the New Music Seminar in New York!
And I watched that punk muthafucka run... while the rest of his homeboys got they ass beat!

Hello? I'm callin' to say since Ice Cube was suckin' so much New York dick...can he come and eat sum of this Chicago pussy?

I smell...  PUSSY!

Yeah, nigga; when we see yo' ass, we gon' cut your hair off and fuck you with' a broomstick!

Think about it, punk muthafucka!You might also likeEmbed
