Panic Zone Lyrics
Panic Zone, don't get your girl in here
A way out in here, a way out in here
A way out in here, a way out in here
A way out in here, a way out in here
A way out in here, a way out in here
Panic Zone, don't get your girl in here
Panic Zone, don't get your girl in here
Panic Zone, don't get your girl

It's called the panic zone (the panic zone)
That's right, the panic zone
Some people call it torture
But it's what we call home
(We are the renegades of this territory
And you're the prey)
I'm the Arabian Prince (and we're N.W.A.)
Don't interfere with the sound you here
'Cause it's a dangerous groove
I'm in control of your mind and soul
Don't be afraid, just bust a move
So far from home
You're on your own
In the land of the unknown
It's the darkside, the darkside
It's called the panic zone
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
The underworld is taking control
You're not only in dimension of sight and sound
But of mind
There's a sign post up ahead, and it reads
"The Panic Zone"

Now the party is at its peak
So we suggest you move your feet
N.W.A. create the groove
And Dr. Dre create the beat
So if you got the juice
And you're feelin' loose
Let the music take your mind
The freaks are here
Don't interfere, our world is one of a kind
This place is called the west
West-Coast of the USA
The Panic Zone's home base
In a place we call L.A
So ladies, all the ladies
If you're all alone
Just call Arabian Prince
In the panic zone (pa-pa-panic zone)
You might also like
A way out in here, a way out in here
A way out in here, a way out in here
A way out in here, a way out in here
A way out in here, a way out in here
