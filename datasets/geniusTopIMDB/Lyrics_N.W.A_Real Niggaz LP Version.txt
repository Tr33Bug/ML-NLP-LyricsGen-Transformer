Real Niggaz (LP Version) Lyrics
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should've covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
Bend ya ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don't try to hang, you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up you ass, you'll get hemorrhoids
Because if you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10

First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think that rap would last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums of so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Titles are takin'
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in

It's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas

You can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find ya
Cause a nigga like Ren's only two steps behind ya
Don't look back, cause you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without Nike's on
Don't say it's psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I get the right flow
You might also like
All these niggas with the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead

Back, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
With that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get?
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real

Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats
They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Because if I let you slide, it's just cause you lucked up
Don't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas

Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad its
Sucka muthafuckas like you making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A - criticized for what we say
But I'm a do this shit anyway
Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in

It's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas
Yeah, motherfucker, it's the real thing
You are now
Real, real niggas, niggas

N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990's
Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E
And I am MC Ren, yo, N.W.A taking over this muthafucka y'allEmbed
