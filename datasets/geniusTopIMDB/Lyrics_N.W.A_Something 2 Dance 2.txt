Something 2 Dance 2 Lyrics
Yo, give me somethin' to dance to
Calling the police, calling the G-Men
Calling all Americans to war in the Underworld

Arabian Prince, back wit' a style that's hype
Not slow and low, it's the fast type
Getting dumb, can you hear the drums?
Yo Dre, why don't you pump it up some?
I pumped it up so now what's up?
Yo Yella boy, add a little cut
What the hell, you think we need some bells?
Yeah, homeboy, might as well
There it is, so now what's next?
A little sss-, so find me a-
Hold it, wait a minute
You need somethin' else in it
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove, bust a move
Yo, yo, I'm tired, what about you?
Man this is somethin' to dance to
Man that's wack, everybody used that
Yo, why dont you bring back the other track
Yeah there you go that's what I'm sayin
I like it when that dope stuffs playin
Real loud, in ya ear hole
Man let's go, I think my feet are swoll' from dancin' so damn much
Man, I don't give a what
You wanna leave? With all these females pullin' on my sleeve?
Aight, bet, you can jet, homeboy, no sweat
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove, bust a move
(Here I come to save the day)
This is somethin' to dance to

Let the bass kick
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance to
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance to
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance to
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance to
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance to
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance to
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance toYou might also like4Embed
