Made Nas Proud  Lyrics
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin
I ain't mad at you, young king, this unsung song is hauntin'
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn
She birthed in September, took my first wind, again, the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas, weak flow, yo Cole let's murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
'Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas, just bein' nasty, nigga
Military hat, fatigue pants saggin', Henny'd up
Execs askin' will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor, Arm and Hammer
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer
Yet still bein' my mama's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was gettin' mad
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warnin'
Global warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'
That's some advice I never got
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock
While you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time
Now I'm playin' Born Sinner loud, saw you live, rock the crowd
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud
You might also like
So you ain't let Nas down
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga
You ain't let Nas down
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin', nigga
You ain't let Nas down

Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end53Embed
