Birds Lyrics
Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over
Nestled in your wings, my little one
Is special, morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over, ohYou might also like3Embed
