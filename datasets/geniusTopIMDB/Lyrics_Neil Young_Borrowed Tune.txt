Borrowed Tune Lyrics
I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it matters
I'm having my doubts

I'm watching the skaters
Fly by on the lake
Ice frozen six feet deep
How long does it take?
I look out on peaceful lands
With no war nearby
An ocean of shaking hands
That grab at the sky

I'm singing this borrowed tune
I took from the Rolling Stones
Alone in this empty room
Too wasted to write my own

I'm climbing this ladder
My head in the clouds
I hope that it mattersYou might also likeEmbed
