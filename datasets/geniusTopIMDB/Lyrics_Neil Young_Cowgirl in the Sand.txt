Cowgirl in the Sand Lyrics
Hello, cowgirl in the sand (Hello, cowgirl in the sand)
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet, sweet smile?

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game
Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hoping that we'd turn bad

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game

Hello, woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems?
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down

Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you
That makes you want to play this gameYou might also like3Embed
