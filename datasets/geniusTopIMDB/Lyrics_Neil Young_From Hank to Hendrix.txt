From Hank to Hendrix Lyrics
From Hank to Hendrix, I walked these streets with you
Here I am with this old guitar, doing what I do
I always expected that you would see me through
I never believed in much but I believed in you

Can we get it together? Can we still stand side by side?
Can we make it last like a musical ride?

From Marilyn to Madonna, I always loved your smile
Now we're headed for the big divorce, California-style
I found myself singing like a long-lost friend
The same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end

Can we get it together? Can we still stand side by side?
Can we make it last like a musical ride?


Sometimes it's distorted, not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringing through
New glass in the window, new leaf on the tree
New distance between us, you and me

Can we get it together? Can we still walk side by side?
Can we make it last like a musical ride?You might also likeEmbed
