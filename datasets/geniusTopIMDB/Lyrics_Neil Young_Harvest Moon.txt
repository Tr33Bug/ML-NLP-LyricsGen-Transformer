Harvest Moon Lyrics
Come a little bit closer, hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping, we could dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising, let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing, let's go out and feel the night

Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon
When we were strangers, I watched you from afar
When we were lovers, I loved you with all my heart
But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate, see it shining in your eye

Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon


Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moonYou might also like7Embed
