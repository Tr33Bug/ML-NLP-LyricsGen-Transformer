Iâ€™m the Ocean Lyrics
I'm an accident, I was driving way too fast
Couldn't stop though, so I let the moment last
I'm for rolling, I'm for tossing in my sleep
It's not guilt though, it's not the company I keep

People my age, they don't do the things I do
They go somewhere while I run away with you
And I've got my friends, and I've got my family too
And I got her love, she's got my love too
And I can't hear you, but I feel the things you say
And I can't see you, but I see what's in my way
Now I'm floating, 'cause I'm not tied to the ground
Words I've spoken seem to leave a hollow sound

On the long plain, see the rider in the night
See the chieftain, see the braves in cool moonlight
Who will love them when they take another life?
Who will hold them when they tremble for the knife?

Voicemail numbers on an old computer screen
Rows of lovers, parked forever in a dream
Screaming sirens echoing across the bay
To the old boats from the city far away

Homeless heroes walk the streets of their hometowns
And rows of zeros on a field that's turning brown
They play baseball, they play football under lights
They play card games and we watch them every night
Need distraction, need romance and candlelight
Need random violence, need entertainment tonight
Need the evidence, want the testimony of
Expert witnesses on the brutal crimes of love

I was too tired to see the news when I got home
Pulled the curtain, fell into bed alone
Started dreaming, saw the rider once again
In the doorway, where she stood and watched for him
Watched for him

I'm not present, I'm a drug that makes you dream
I'm an aerostar, I'm a cutlass supreme
In the wrong lane, trying to turn against the flow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow

I'm the ocean
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertow
I'm the ocean, I'm the giant undertowEmbed
