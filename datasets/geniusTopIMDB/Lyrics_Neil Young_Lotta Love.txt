Lotta Love Lyrics
La la la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

It's gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love
Or we won't get too far
So if you look in my direction
And we don't see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I
It's gonna take a lotta love
To get us through the night
It's gonna take a lotta love
To make things work out right
So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
'Cause my head needs relating
Not solitude

Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love

La la la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

It's gonna take a lotta love (It takes a lotta love)
To change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love (It takes a lotta love)
Or we won't get too far
It's gonna take a lotta love (It takes a lotta love)
It's gonna take a lotta loveYou might also likeEmbed
