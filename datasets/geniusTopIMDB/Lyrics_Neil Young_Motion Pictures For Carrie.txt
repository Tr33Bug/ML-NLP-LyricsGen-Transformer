Motion Pictures (For Carrie) Lyrics
Motion pictures on my TV screen
A home away from home and I'm living in between
But I hear some people have got their dream
I've got mine

I hear the mountains are doing fine
Morning glory is on the vine
And the dew is fallin'
The ducks are callin'
Yes, I've got mine
Well, all those people
They think they got it made
But I wouldn't buy, sell, borrow or trade
Anything I have to be like one of them
I'd rather start all over again

Well, all those headlines, they just bore me now
I'm deep inside myself, but I'll get out somehow
And I'll stand before you
And I'll bring a smile to your eyes
Motion pictures
