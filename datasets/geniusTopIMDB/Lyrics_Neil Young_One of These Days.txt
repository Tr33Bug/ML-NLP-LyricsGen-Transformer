One of These Days Lyrics
One of these days, I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
I'm going to try and thank them all for the good times together
Though so apart we've grown

One of these days, I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days, one of these days
One of these days and it won't be long (It won't be long)
It won't be long (It won't be long)
And I'm going to thank that old country fiddler
And all those rough boys who play that rock 'n' roll
I never tried to burn any bridges
Though I know I let some good things go

One of these days, I'm gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days, one of these days
One of these days and it won't be long (It won't be long)
It won't be long (It won't be long)

From down in L.A. all the way to Nashville
From New York City to my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak, some are strong

One of these days, I'm going to sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days, one of these days
One of these days and it won't be long (It won't be long)
It won't be long (It won't be long)
You might also like
One of these days, one of these days
One of these days and it won't be long (It won't be long)
It won't be long (It won't be long)
One of these days, one of these days
One of these days and it won't be long (It won't be long)
(It won't be long)1Embed
