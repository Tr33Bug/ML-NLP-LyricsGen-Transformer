Revolution Blues Lyrics
Well, we live in a trailer at the edge of town
You never see us because we don't come around
We got twenty five rifles just to keep the population down
But we need you now and that's why I'm hanging around
So you be good to me and I'll be good to you
And in this land of conditions I'm not above suspicion
I won't attack you but I won't back you

Well, it's so good to be here asleep on your lawn
Remember your guard dog? Well, I'm afraid that he's gone
It was such a drag to hear him whining all night long
Yes, that was me with the doves, setting them free near the factory
Where you build your computer love
I hope you get the connection 'cause I can't take the rejection
I won't deceive you, I just don't believe you

Well, I'm a barrel of laughs with my carbine on
I keep 'em hopping till my ammunition's gone
But I'm still not happy, I feel like there's something wrong
I got the revolution blues, I see bloody fountains
And ten million dune buggies coming down the mountains
Well, I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars
But I hate them worse than lepers and I'll kill them in their carsYou might also likeEmbed
