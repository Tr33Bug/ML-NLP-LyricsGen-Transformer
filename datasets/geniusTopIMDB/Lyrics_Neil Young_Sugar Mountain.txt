Sugar Mountain Lyrics
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette
You might also like
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon3Embed
