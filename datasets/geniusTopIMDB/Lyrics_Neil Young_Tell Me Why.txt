Tell Me Why Lyrics
Sailin' heart ships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell?
Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell?

Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay
But young enough to sell?You might also like6Embed
