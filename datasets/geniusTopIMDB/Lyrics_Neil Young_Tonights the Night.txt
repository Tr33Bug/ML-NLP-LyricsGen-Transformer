Tonightâ€™s the Night Lyrics
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night (Yes it is)
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Well, late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night

Early in the morning, at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
'Cause, people, let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he'd died out on the mainline

Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night


Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
Well, early in the morning
Just about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
You might also like
Tonight's the night, yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, oh yes, it is
Tonight's the night
Oh, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
