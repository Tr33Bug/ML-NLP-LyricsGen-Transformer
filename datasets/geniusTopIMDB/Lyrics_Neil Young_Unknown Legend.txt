Unknown Legend Lyrics
She used to work in a diner, never saw a woman look finer
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor
She grew up in a small town, never put her roots down
Daddy always kept moving so she did too

Somewhere on a desert highway, she rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life, the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes
You know it ain't easy, you got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now she's dressing two kids, looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes

Somewhere on a desert highway, she rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life, the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes


Somewhere on a desert highway, she rides a Harley-Davidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
She's been running half her life, the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathesYou might also like4Embed
