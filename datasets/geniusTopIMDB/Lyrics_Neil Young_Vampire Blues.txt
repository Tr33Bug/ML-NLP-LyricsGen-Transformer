Vampire Blues Lyrics
I'm a vampire, baby, sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, baby, sucking blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, baby, sell you twenty barrels worth

I'm a black bat, baby, banging on your window pane
I'm a black bat, baby, banging on your window pane
Well, I'm a black bat, baby, I need my high octane

Good times are comin', I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are comin', I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are comin', but they sure are comin' slow

Well I'm a vampire, baby, suckin' blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, baby, suckin' blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, baby, I'll sell you twenty barrels worth
Good times are comin'You might also like1Embed
