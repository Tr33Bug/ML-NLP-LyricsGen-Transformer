Walk On Lyrics
I hear some people been talking me down
Bring up my name, pass it 'round
They don't mention the happy times
They do their thing, I do mine

Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later, it all gets real
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on
I remember the good old days
Stayed up all night getting crazed
Then the money was not so good
But we still did the best we could

Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
Sooner or later, it all gets real
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk onYou might also likeEmbed
