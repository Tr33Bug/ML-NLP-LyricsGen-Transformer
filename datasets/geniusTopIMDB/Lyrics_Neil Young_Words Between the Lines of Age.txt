Words (Between the Lines of Age) Lyrics
Someone and someone were down by the pond
Looking for something to plant in the lawn
Out in the fields, they were turning the soil
I'm sitting here hoping this water will boil
When I look through the window and out on the road
They're bringing me presents and sayin' hello

Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of age
If I was a junkman selling your cars
Washing your windows and shining your stars
Thinking your mind was my own in a dream
What would you wonder and how would it seem?
Living in castles a bit at a time
The King started laughing and talking in rhyme

Singing words, words
Between the lines of age
Words, words
Between the lines of ageYou might also like1Embed
