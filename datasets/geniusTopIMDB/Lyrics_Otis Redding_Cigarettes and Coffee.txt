Cigarettes and Coffee LyricsIt's early in the morning
About a quarter 'til three
I'm sitting here talking with my baby
Over cigarettes and coffee, now
And to tell you that
Darling I've been so satisfied
Honey, since I met you
Baby, since I met you
All the places that I've been around
And all the good looking girls I've met
They just don't seem to fit in
Knowing it's particularly sad, yeah
But it seems so natural, darling
That you and I are here
Just talking over cigarettes and drinking coffee
And oh, my heart cries out
Love at last I've found you, oh now
And honey won't you let me
Just build my whole life around you
And while how complete, how complete my whole life would be, yeah
If you would take things under consideration
And walk down this aisle with me
And I would love it, yeah
People, I say it's so early in the morning
Ooh, it's a quarter 'til three
We're sitting here talking
Over cigarettes and drinking coffee, now, lord
And I'd like to show you, well
I've known nothing but good old joy
Since I met you, darling
Honey, since I've met you, baby, yeah
I would love to have another drink of coffee, now
And please, darling, help me smoke just one more cigarette, now
I don't want no cream and sugar
'Cause I've got you now, darling
But just let me enjoy, help me to enjoy
This good time that we'll have, baby
It's so early, so early in the morning
So early, so early in the morning
And I've got you
And you've got me
And we'll have each other
And we don't, we don't want nothing but joy, y'all
Nothing but joyYou might also like1Embed
