Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song) LyricsFa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
I keep singing them sad, sad songs, y'all
Sad songs is all I know
I keep singing them sad, sad songs, y'all
Sad songs is all I know
It has a sweet melody tonight
Anybody can sing it any old time
It touches your heart
Puts you in a groove
And when you sing this song
It'll make your whole body move
It goes, Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Your turn
My turn
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Your turn now
All my life I've been singin' sad songs
Tryin' to get my message to you, honey
But that's the only song, y'all, I can sing
And when you get through singin'
My message will be to you
It goes, Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Your turn now
It's a lovely song, y'all
Sweet music, honey
It's just a line, oh but
It tells a story, baby
You got to get the message
A stone message, honey
A lovely line, baby
I'm worried in mind, watch me
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Your turn
Everybody's turn, everybody
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
One more time
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa
Worried in mind, y'all
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa...You might also likeEmbed
