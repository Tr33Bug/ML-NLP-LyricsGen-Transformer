Free Me LyricsTurn me loose
There ain't no use
Free me darling
Don't hang me up
Let me go from your love, now
Just like a prisoner
You got me chained and bound
Unlock 'em, Let me go, let me go
Get 'em from around
Turn me loose
There ain't no use
Free me baby, Let me go, Turn me loose
From your love, now
You know I did love you, yeah
Do anything in the world for you
I try my best, I try my very best, yeah, please
The way your treating me
Keep me in misery
I'm so weak, I'm so weak, I'm so weak
To walk away
It's up to you
To say we're through
Oh, free me baby, let me go, turn me loose baby
From your love
I got to tell you, Listen this
I know sometime
I wonder do you really love me
And if you don't, if you don't
You got to let me know
Let me go
Your love is not shown
Break these chains
Break them, tear them apart
Let me love again
You might also likeTurn me loose
There ain't no use
Let me go, darling
If you don't want me
Free me
Let me go
Unchain me
From your loveEmbed
