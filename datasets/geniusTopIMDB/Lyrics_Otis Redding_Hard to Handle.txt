Hard to Handle Lyrics
Baby, here I am, I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to go home with me
I've got some good old loving and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on you you got to come back for more

Boys and things will come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug store loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yes I am
Action speaks louder than word and I'm a man of a great experience
I know you got you another man but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I wanna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so won't you place your ad with me?

Boys will come a dime by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but ten cent loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now, yes I am

Baby, here I am, I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to go home with me
I've got some good old loving and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on you you got to come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug store loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yes I am

Give it to me, I got to have it
Give it to me, good old lovingYou might also likeEmbed
