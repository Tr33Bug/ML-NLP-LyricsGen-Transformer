I Want to Thank You LyricsI want to thank you for being so nice now
I want to thank you for giving me my pride
Sweet kisses too and everything you do
I know I'll never find another one like you
If I prove my love, it won't be true
Oh, my my darling
How, how can I forget you?
I remember the first day that we met
I taught you how to smoke your first cigarette
You were so sweet in everything you did
And oh darling, you made me seem so big
Just to have you right there in my arms
Just to hold, to squeeze
All of your sweet loving charm
I wanna thank you
Darling, I wanna love you
I wanna thank you again and say bye bye
I wanna thank you again, oh, how I will cry
Sweet kisses to you in everything you do
Darling, I wish I had another one like you
Just to hold you, have them in my arms
It'll bring back memories
Of all of your sweet loving charm
I wanna thank you, yeah
Darling, I wanna love you
Baby, I wanna hold you
Please please, let me kiss youYou might also likeEmbed
