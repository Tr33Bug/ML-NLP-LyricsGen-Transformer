Love Man Lyrics
I'm a Love Man
Call me a Love Man
Ooh baby, I'm a Love Man
That's what they call me, I'm a Love Man
I'm six-feet-one, weigh two-hundred-and-ten
Long hair, real fair skin
Long legs and I'm outta sight
Hey, little girl, I wanna take you out
'Cause I'm a love man
That's what they call me, I'm a Love Man
Make love to you in the mornin', girl
Make love to you at night now
Make love to when you think about it
I'm gonna bet you everything's alright
'Cau-cau-cau-cau...

'Cause I'm a Love Man
Ooh baby, I'm a Love Man
That's what they call me, I'm a Love Man
Baby, call the Love Man
I'm six-feet-one, weigh two-hundred-and-ten
Long hair, real fair skin
I'm long-legged and I'm outta sight
My, my baby, I wanna take you out
'Cause I'm a love man
Ooh baby, I'm a Love Man
Take my hand; let me holler one time, OW!


Love Man, that's all I am now
I'm just a Love Man
Ooh baby, call me the Love Man
Yes I am, I'm just a Love Man

Which one of you girls want me to hold you?
A Which one of you girls want me to kiss you?
Which one of your girls wants me to take you out?
