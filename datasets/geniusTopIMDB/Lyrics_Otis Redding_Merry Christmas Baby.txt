Merry Christmas, Baby Lyrics
Merry Christmas, baby
Sure do treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby
Sure do treat me nice
Bought me a diamond ring for Christmas
I feel like I'm in paradise

I feel mighty fine, y'all
I've got music on my radio
Feel mighty fine, girl
I've got music on my radio, oh, oh, oh
I feel like I'm gonna kiss you
Standing beneath that mistletoe
Santa came down the chimney
Half past three, y'all
Left all them good ol' presents
For my baby and for me, ha, ha, ha
Merry Christmas, baby
Sure do treat me nice
You bought me all those good ol' presents
I love you, baby, rest of my life

Merry Christmas, girl
Merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby
Sure do treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby
I said you sure do treat me nice
You bought all those lovely things, yeah
I feel like I'm in paradise

I wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
Happy New Year, ha
A Merry Christmas, honey
Everything here is beautiful
I love you, baby
For everything that you give me
I love you, honey, more, Lord have mercy
Merry Christmas, honeyYou might also likeEmbed
