My Girl Lyrics
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And it's cold outside, I've got the month of May

Oh, I guess you'd say
What can make, ooh, me feel this way?
It's my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

I've got so much loving, oh, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song that I can sing, than the birds in the trees
Oh, I guess you will say
Ooh, what can make me feel this way?
It's my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, ooh, hoo

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I don't need no money, all I need is my fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one big man can claim

Oh, I guess you'd say
Ooh, "What can make you feel this way?"
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

Ooh, I've got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
I've even got the month of May with my, my, my girl
Talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, talkin' 'bout, ooh, ooh, oohYou might also likeEmbed
