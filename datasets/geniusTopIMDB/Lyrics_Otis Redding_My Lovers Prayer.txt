My Loverâ€™s Prayer LyricsThis is my lover's prayer
I hope it'll reach out to you, my love
This is my lover's prayer
And I hope you can understand it, my love
My life is such a weary thing
But it might be old pressure bringing rain
You keep me wanting, waiting and wishing
When I know deep down, I'm not to blame
What you gonna do tonight
When you need some lovin' arms to hold you tight?
Tell me, what you gonna do tonight
When you need my heavy voice to tell you goodnight?
Honey, but you can't let that be no problem
You've got to come on home and help me solve 'em
Then I won't be missing you
And honey, my lover's prayer would be all over, oh my
What can the matter be, now?
It can't be too serious we can't talk it over
Living in this misery, darling
You can't make my life all over
Honey, but don't you let that be no problem
Just come on home and help me solve 'em
Then I won't be missing you, I won't be missing you
And my lover's prayer would be all over
It got to be all over, honey, all over
Don't keep my life going round in so many circles
This is my lover's prayer, come on, come on, come on home
This is my lover's prayer
I'm singing out to you and I hope it will reach you, darling
This is my lover's prayer, I hope to get the message to youYou might also likeEmbed
