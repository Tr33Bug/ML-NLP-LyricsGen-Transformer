Open The Door Lyrics
I've been so wrong, so many times
And you know what I'm talkin' about
We've all been wrong a time in our life
And we all make mistakes sometimes of leaving what's good for us
I made that mistake, and now I'm tryin' to get back to my baby

This runnin' round, sure 'nough, is killin' me
Let me, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me ease on in
Look into my eyes
Can't you see I got to come on in?
I ain't lyin', and I ain't smilin' 'bout it, baby
Open the door or I'm bustin' in
Because this runnin' around
Sure 'nough, sure 'nough, is killin' me
Yes it is, it's killin' me, baby
I got to come on in
Let me in, baby, please, let me in
I got to come on in, honey
Open the door
Open the door
Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me ease on in
Mama, mama, got to come in
Open the door
I can't stand this cold
Let me in this house
I'm tired of this runnin' around
Tired of being, tired of being all alone
Standing out here and walkin' with, walkin' with
Or walkin' with someone
I'm tired of just being out here
I'm tired of being out here, it's cold
Open the door, open the doorYou might also likeEmbed
