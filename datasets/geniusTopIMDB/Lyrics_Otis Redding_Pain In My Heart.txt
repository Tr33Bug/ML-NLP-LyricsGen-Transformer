Pain In My Heart Lyrics
Pain in my heart, she's treating me cold
Where can my baby be? Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart just won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be? Lord, where can she be?

Another day has began to get tough
Said I want you to come back, come back, come back, baby
Till I had enough, oh
A little pain in my heart just won't let me be
I wake up at restless nights, Lord, and I can't even sleep
Mmm hmm, yeah

Another day has began to get rough
Said I want you to love me, love me, love me, baby
Until I get enough, oh

Pain in my heart
A little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Someone stop this pain
Someone stop this pain, ohYou might also like1Embed
