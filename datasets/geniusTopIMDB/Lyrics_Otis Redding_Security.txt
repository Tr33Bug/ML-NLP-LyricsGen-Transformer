Security Lyrics
I want security, yeah
Without it I'm at a great loss, oh now
Security, yes
And I want it at any cost, oh now
I don't want no money right now, no no no no no no
I don't want no paper
But security, I'll have all of these things, yes
All of these things here now
Security, yes
That's all I want from you, oh now
Security, yeah
And a little love that will be true, oh
Your sweet tender lips you know they tells me
That you're the one for me
Darling, how can I forget
How can I forget, yeah


I want security, yeah
I'm telling you once again, oh now
Security, and I want it in the end, oh now
Your sweet tender lips you know they tells me
That you're the one for me
Darling, how can I forget
How can I forget, yeah

Come on, with just a little bit of soul right now, baby
Lord, everything is gonna be alright
One more time, just one more time, baby
Don't it, don't it sound pretty good right now, sugar?
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, baby
I need a little security right now, baby
Come on, come onYou might also likeEmbed
