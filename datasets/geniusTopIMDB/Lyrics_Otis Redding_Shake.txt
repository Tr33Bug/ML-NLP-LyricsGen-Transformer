Shake with the FEELING!
Shake with the FEELING!
Listen while I'm talkin' to you now
Tell you what I'm gonna do now
There's a new thing going around now
I'll tell what to put down now
You move your body all around
And just shake
Thats the way you do it Shake, Shake, Shake it baby
Shake it like a bowl of soup
Let your body loop de loop
Put your hands on your hip
Come on and let your backbone slip
Move your body like your hip
And just shake!
Shake early in the morning
Shake early in the evening
A Ring-A-Ling-a-Ling
Honey, Shakin' is the greatest thing
But if you really roll Gotta do the thing with SOUL!
Shake shake with all your might now
If you do it, do it right now
Put your hands on your hip,yeah
Come on and let your backbone slip
Move your body like your hip
And just shake

Early in the morning
Early in the evening All night long, y'all!
