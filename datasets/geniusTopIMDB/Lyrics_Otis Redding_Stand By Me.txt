Stand By Me Lyrics
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand by me
Now darling, darling
Whenever I'm in trouble
Darling, won't you stand
I need just a little helping hand
Now, now, now
And darling, darling
Won't you stand by me

If the sky we look upon, now, now
Should tumble and fall
All of the mountains may crumble
May crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, no, no, no, no, I won't shed no tears
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand by me

Now darling, darling
I said I need somebody right now
I need just a little helping hand
Need someone to come pick me up
And let you stand by me
Come on, come on now, baby, yeah
Baby, come on, come on and stand, stand by me
And darling, darling, stand by me
Come on, pretty baby, stand there, stand, stand by me
Come on and help me, baby
I need a little love, come on and stand right be
Whenever I'm in trouble, won't you stand
Come on and stand by me
My, my, my, my, my baby, come on
I need a little bit of love
I need someone to come on, darling, just stand by meYou might also likeEmbed
