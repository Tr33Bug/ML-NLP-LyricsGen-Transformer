The Glory of Love Lyrics
Give a little, take a little
And let your little heart just cry a little
That's the story of
That's the glory of love
Y'all, I know what I'm talking about, mhm

Sigh a little, yeah, cry just a little
And let that old wind just blow right on by a little, yeah
That's the story of
That's the glory of love
I still know what I'm talking about, y'all
When this whole world gets tired of us
We'll have each other and all our charms
When this whole world gets through with us
We'll have each other's arms, yeah yeah

Cry a little, sigh just a little
Let that old wind just-a blow right by a little
That's the story of
That's the glory of love, oh

It's the glory, glory, the glory, the glory of
It's the glory of love
Everybody knows it's the story of, it's the story of
It's the glory of love
I got to tell you 'bout the glory of, the glory of
The glory of love
You got to know what the glory is, the glory is
Everybody ought to know what the glory of love is
The glory of, it's the glory of, the glory of love
Everybody know it's the glory of, it's the glory of
Lord have mercy...You might also like1Embed
