White Christmas Lyrics
I'm, I'm dreaming, dreaming of a white, white Christmas
Just like the ones that I used to know
Honey, it's where the treetops, treetops glisten
Little bitty, little bitty, little bitty children, they'll try to listen
To hear, hear for the sleigh bells that are ringing in the snow
I wanna tell you one more time what I am thinking about

I, I, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, yeah
With every Christmas card that I'll write you, oh
I want you to know
May your days, may your days be so merry, merry and bright
Oh darling, I wished all of 'em
One more thing
And may all, all of your Christmases
And may all, and may all of your Christmases
Baby, may your days be merry, merry, so merry and bright
Lord have mercy, I wished all of 'em, honey
And may all of your Christmases be so white
Have mercy, of a white, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm dreaming, dreaming of a white, white Christmas
Baby, baby, all I'm dreaming, dreaming of a Christmas
Yeah, lovely, white Christmas
One with snow, the one with everybody...You might also likeEmbed
