Wonderful World LyricsI Don't know much about history
Don't know much about biology
Don't know much about the science book
Don't know much about the French I took
All I do know is I love you
And I wonder  if you love me too
Ooh, what a wonderful world this gonna be
I don't know much about geography
Don't know much about trigonometry
Don't know much about the algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
All I do know, one and one is two
And I wonder if you love me too
What a wonderful world this gonna be
Now, I don't claim to be an A student
But that's what I'm trying to be
But by being an A student, baby
Look like I can win your love for me
Don't know much about the history, now
Don't know much about biology
I don't know much about the science book
Don't know much about the good French I took, oh
What I do know is I love you
And I wonder if you love me too
Ooh, what a wonderful world this could be
Good God, I don't claim to be an A student
But that's what I'm trying to be
But if I have to be an A student, baby
I'm gonna win no love for me
I don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about the algebra
Don't know what a good slide rule is for
But I do know, one and one is two
And I wonder if you love me too
What a wonderful world this gonna be
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha
I've been trying, I've been trying, I've been tryingYou might also likeEmbed
