(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher & Higher Lyrics
Your love keeps lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So give me love, which is my desire, honey
I'm gonna be at your side, forevermore
Now, you know your love keeps lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So give me love, oh, which is my desire
I'm gonna be at your side, forevermore

Now, I was once down and broken hearted
And disappointment was my closest friend
And then you, you came in, heated hearted
And you know he never, showed his face again
Now, you know your love keeps lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So give me love, which is my desire
I'm gonna be at your side, forevermore


Know your love, lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So give me love, which is my desire
I'm gonna be at your side, forevermore
Now, you know your love keeps lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So give me love, which is my desire, honey
I'm gonna be at your side, forevermore

Oh, I've got to tell you 'bout it
Keep me, lift me on up, lift me
Lift me little higher, now, keep me going all up
I wanna higher, higher, higher, higher
Get me up there, I gotta get on up there
Lift me, lift me, lift me, lift me
Keep on lifting me, up, up, up, up, up, up
Gotta get on up, gotta, gotta, get on up there
Lift a little, little bit...You might also likeEmbed
