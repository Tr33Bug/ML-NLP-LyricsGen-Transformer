Youâ€™re Still My Baby LyricsYou're gone away, yeah yeah
And you done left me alone, yeah
I've got nobody to call my own
I believe it's bye, bye, baby, yeah
I wish you a lot of luck, darling
But you're still my baby, my baby
Told you I love you, honey, yes, I did
Many, many, many times again, yeah
I've always played a losin' hand
But it's bye, bye, bye, baby
That's what you're tellin' me
I wish you a lot of luck, darling
But I'm letting you know you're still my baby, ooh yeah
You may be, yes you may be
A thousand miles away, yeah
No matter how far or you may be
Lookin' at me somewhere right here in this town
Lord, Lord, but tell me all I, all I
All I want to know, know, tell
Tell me what did I do, honey
Why, why, why did you put me down, darling, darling
Somebody, somebody help me
Of all this pain, yeah
But I've always played a losin' game
But it's bye, bye, baby, yeah that's what you tellin'
Lots of luck, darling but I want you to know
That you're still my baby, my baby, baby, yeah
You're still my baby, yeah, I want you to know
No matter where you go, go
No matter where I see you
I want you to be my baby
No matter what the world do to you, honey
I want you to be my baby
No matter how big you get honey
I want you to be my baby
No matter what you afford to take
You can always come back and be my babyYou might also likeEmbed
