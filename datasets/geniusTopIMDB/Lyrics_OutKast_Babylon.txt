Babylon Lyrics
I came into this world high as a bird
From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted, but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
And bitches, they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route, turn each other out, burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?
But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down when you speak from your heart—now that's hard
While we ranting and raving 'bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats they got some shit that'll blow out our backs from where they stay at
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping (Hoping), wishing (Wishing), praying
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith)
In you, in you

I'm fascinated by the way your nipples peak at me through your blouse
Freaky me, freaky you can't help but be a-roused
'Scuse me, Lord, lustful thinking, but that's the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on until we felt excited then (Aaaah)
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what I'm talking about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong

Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you (Oh, ooh)
You might also like
People don't know the stress I'm dealing with, day to day (Day)
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee
Moping around and wondering where she stay, saw her last that she lay
Give it another day, I say, but the Lord, he taketh away
Now give it back, Lord, 'cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store, crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth before a nigga like Daddy was born
But they be making it seem that my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean, my lyrics ain't clean?

Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (So I keep hoping)
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying (Praying)
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you (My faith in you)
In you
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here, someday, we will be gone (I keep hoping)
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you (Keep my faith)
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith—13Embed
