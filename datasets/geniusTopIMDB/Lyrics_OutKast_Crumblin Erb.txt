Crumblin’ Erb Lyrics
Yessuh, let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Poverty got me selling thangs, guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up
But still André got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine, thinking that you gots
Ample time to do this, have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less, bet' be ready
When they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest and
You's gone, up outta here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, wassup?
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me, I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but, shit, they missed me, huh
I'm getting nice with them thangs, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and, yes, my man, I'm true to dat
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses, diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters, count 'em, nigga, fuck a nine
See, I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys, kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayonara suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page
Ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets
Like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over
You might also like
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

Wooo! Big Boi
Got a Tampa Nugget blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping
It's simply marvelous, time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit to take another hit, so hit it
Of the cannabis sativa weed reefer, yeah, smoke shit
It's all day e'ery day 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world, peace

We is gonna smoke out until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards I be buryin'
Coming around my shop with that, see, nigga, you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting, I be having your posse ducking
Nothing but King Shit, I am asking, sucka, can you hang?
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle sprinkle, motherfucker, don't be crying on me
That southern cess be in my chest until I'm chillin' in peace, yeah
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

Ah, shit now
Coming in like two fat hoes sitting off on Corn Flakes
Dropping these things like French fries in hot grease
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast
The J-O-I, just to let y'all niggas know
Forever pimping, never slipping, that's how it is
That how it's gon' be, that's how it was in the past
That's how it's gon' be in the futures, nigga
It's all day everyday, so what you wanna do with it?
Bring that shit on, know what I'm saying? Yeah

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb12Embed
