Gangsta Shit Lyrics
Some of that uh, LTD Lincoln Town Car
Some of that El Dorado funk, know what I'm talking about
Gangsta Shit, you know, lay back, cool out, yeah
You know we keep it crunk around here, A-town style
Getting head on the highways yeah, but this what I wanna know

Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, O-N-P, G-Double O-D-I-E, so fresh so clean
Back with Stankonia, Dungeon Family-ee
Pearl Cadillac on D's and Vogues, flip flops, T-shirts and Dickies
It's the return of Billy Ocean, Cuervo is my drink
Stank, stank means you got the funkiest, dopest heat on the street
Three G ski, Slimm, Big Boi and this is C B-O-N-E
If you need some back-up, find your own
Ya girl gonna give you grief at home
Just tell her these hoes wanna be on the same team that she's playing on

Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Outkast, Goodie Mob, and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps

Dope boys in the trap like to stack the dough, when beef come around, can't let it go
When my funds turn legit, I'mma let you know, ridin' rims real good down Old National
It's trappable—two bed, Jacuzzi bath, it's natural—puttin' cheese in ya stash
Un-taxable—futhermuckers get mad, steady watching myself, got eyes in my back
Don't take no slack when you managing the trap, if you work out, gotta get it right back
I trap by day, boy, rap by night, C-Bone in this bitch, College Park trump tight

I'm pimp tight, give a fuck, niggas know what's up
It's T-Mo and Outkast in the back of my truck
We gotta simple little problem that we got to solve
It like it ain't about the money, we got to handle the job
No colors or rags, just guns and masks
We not scared to blast and dip off fast
With the Dungeon clique, just pulled a lick
Now what you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps
Back on the scene, a sack of green sitting on chrome and rubber bands
Paint looking like Candyland, it's Slimm, the southpaw triggerman
Flippin' work and whippin' weight, rock up, roll and get the papes
Chop them hoes and then you skate, back to the block wit the deflate
Grams the O's, slabes to whole one's da flake
A young nigga holdin big face foldin'
Pimps are known for catching runaways
A good hustler's known to keep his gun away
First nigga run up and try to jack mine
First nigga fuck up to get flat-lined
Pack still stainless Coupe and Verts brainless
Y'all don't wanna fuck wit me, the trunk be  bangin
Off the chain danglin', y'all know that I'm from CP
(When do ya shoot boy, shot don’t reverse, send to the downtown send for the nurse)

Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps

OutKast with a K, yeah, them niggas are hard
Harder than a nigga tryna impress God
We'll pull your whole deck, fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
Get full, and niggas, niggas
Pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
As if pitbulls went out of style, made a vow to myself
If it's for the wealth I'll stop, well put it like this
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer or fall
I dont stall, slow drag wit' your brain against the wall
Yeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side don't fall
All y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for? You're on that reefer and on that 2Pac
In front of them ooh-wops, trying to show out, that's the ho route
Talking loud talking bout that's gangsta shit4Embed
