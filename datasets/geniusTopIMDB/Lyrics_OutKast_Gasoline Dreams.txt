Gasoline Dreams Lyrics
Woo
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go
All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga 'round me playing married or paying child support
I can't cope
Never made no sense to me, one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids
Woe, woe
The world is moving fast and I'm losing my balance
Now, time to dig, low, low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up, you with me?
Say shit, sho, sho
Now let me ask y'all this

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time
On a first offense drug bust—fuck the ho-lice!
That's if you're racist or you're crooked
Arrest me for this dope, I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world 'cause over a million people took it
Look at me, I'm out of your jurisdiction, now you're lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me, sir
Don't make me call L.A.—he'll have you walking, sir
A couple of months ago, they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes, and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law?
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage, we scream
Don't everybody, everybody...
You might also like
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Officer of the most high
You touch me, you touch the apple of his eye
If they kick us out, where will we go?
Not to Africa 'cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kinfolk
Still eating pork
Abomination, desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on Judgment Day
Hip-hip-hooray!
Mystery, Babylon the great
The mother of harlots is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled
The lake of fire is calling

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go11Embed
