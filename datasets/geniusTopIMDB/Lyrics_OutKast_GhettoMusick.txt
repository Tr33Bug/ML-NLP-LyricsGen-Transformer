GhettoMusick Lyrics
Woo!
Turn me up, don't turn me down
Cut me up, don't let me down
Find, find a way

Find a way to get out, a-without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
GhettoMusick
GhettoMusick (Woo)
Find a way to get in, to fit in, to get on
To get out, without a doubt
GhettoMusick
GhettoMusick
Climbing out this hole (Climbing out this hole)
With a frown on my face
(In the place to be) In the place to be and not to be at the same time

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us—

Find a way to get out, a-without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
GhettoMusick
GhettoMusick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out, without a doubt
GhettoMusick
GhettoMusick

I just want you to know how I feel (How I feel)
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel, oh, I
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
Ask my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse—she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip-hop standard destroyer
Leave a motherfucker open like a foyer
"He from the Dirty"— now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit, and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth
This planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame you've obtained
You ought to be detained
By the Hip-Hop Sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh, new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy, 'cause if it's not, we gotta fight, like

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't wait 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us—
Find a way to get out, a-without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
GhettoMusick
GhettoMusick (Woo)
Find a way to get in, to fit in, to get on
To get out, without a doubt
GhettoMusick

I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?10Embed
