Mamacita Lyrics
Mahogany Team Queens up on the rise
Be careful, watch your back, blackbirds don't wear disguise
How we comin, comin hard.. camels too slow
Stick up kids do anything, hustlers keep loot to show (what?)
The game is hot you could never be a winner
Just begun a game so considered a beginner
Masada for real, this shorty here is here to stay
Mahogany go platinum after that we just parlay
I'm from the Bricks we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks
Fuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nixed
This life is plush I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want
Italiano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?
Can't be a joke I've been through too many games
Niggas laugh, but my expression wasn't hardly the same
Show me respect cause it's due, you keep the fear
Cause I'll get over and believe I'll come back at you
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Yo, now, you and your nigga shit shaky
And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
Lump in your throat, feel like a trachea, oh dummy
The pain that's in your chest done made it's way down to your tummy
You wide open, you start smokin' with your girl
She nigga-bashin', sayin', "You don't need em in your world, niggas all dogs!"
If niggas all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and her done got to drankin'
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drunk and your girl done got to thinkin'
She talkin bout, "Girl you look so beautiful"
You say, "thank you," bein' nice, you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua, how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you, she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do -- you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, "Bitch don't ever disrespect me, never not at all"
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause
Then black ball laws of balance at all cost
You might also like

Que pasa, que pasa? Check this out
Quiet nights like this, might twist one for the mota
On the balcony, I got a sofa
Nights like this is perfect, for this Spanish Fly
Can you come over, somethin, I wanna show ya
Told ya once we was gon' take a trip, touch you
With my lips where you like it, it's time, don't fight it
Piggy-back ride to the sofa, in the microwave
I got your favorite Stouffer's, lasagna, that's how much
I want ya, fuck flowers
The ceremony starts from the shower with the water
I got somebody's daughter in the Doctor headquarters, chillin
Prepare for this sex drillin, she said somethin in Spanish
Got me feelin mannish, me and you fin' ta vanish
Real quick, feel this shit, got cheese, tryin to make cheese
To get you pregnant overseas
Maybe make sho' that's my seed
Quiet nights like this, bachelor like me is single
Talkin to you Miss Bilingual
Let's mingle in the crowd, watch them show, pop some Moet
Tryin to get you so wet, never been to Spain
Never been a lame, horny, ever since I been a tiny
Fuckin with niggas with ageless bodies
Talkin to me, while I squeeze it bare
Let me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna

Friday night boi, breakin the old school out, boi we cruisin
Bout fo' niggas and fo' hoes, it ain't gon be nobody losin
But they choosin
Better get in where you fit in cause it's crucial
I'm tryin to cut bout two of them girls
Cause that just what I'm used to
I mean that
The first that look my way just gon' get splack packed
From the front to the back this cognac got my throat burnin like burlap
Everybody cheesin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like Pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew
Like Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus
The easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie
She thought we was some motherfuckin genies
So I checked her, like the king I am, no disrespect intended
Told her, and her silly friends
"Get out" before they got offended
To the La Quinta we went, layin them hoes down
On the freestyle tip, geyeah!
