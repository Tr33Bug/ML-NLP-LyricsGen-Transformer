Millennium Lyrics
Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse, but now I'm pacin' back and forth
Inside, I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say "amen"
I hope He understands I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say "forget it"
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and, like Riddick
Bowe, I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
"It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass", but that gets old too
I'm weakenin' like a deacon doing dirt
What am I s'posed do?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Planets and stars)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (Earth, Jupiter, Mars)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Clothes, hoes, cars)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (It's who you are)

See, from bedknobs to broomsticks, we lookin' to start some new shit
I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your craniums with juices
See, Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong, 'cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, "I'm proud of you people
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white, not black"
Shit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we fallin' apart
You lookin' me in my eye, but you ain't feelin' me in your heart
Yes, yes, Lord, give me the power, we live in the final hour
These niggas, they leavin' me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marching, 'cause they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch?
