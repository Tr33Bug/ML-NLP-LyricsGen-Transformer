Prototype Lyrics
I hope that you're the one
If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do things I know you like

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

(Today) Today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do something out of the ordinary
Like catch a matin√©e
Baby, you are the prototype
(I think I'm) I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that, but hey
We can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

(Let's go) Let's go to the movies, yeah
And, action!
Come here
Nah, come here
Uh-uh, I said, come here
Come here

I think I'm in love again (Girl, right now)
I think I'm in love again (I wanna say)
I wanna say, Stank you (Stank you) very much
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world
I think I'm in love again (I can't, I'm not)
I can't afford to not record
I think I'm in love again (I think I wanna say)
I think I wanna say Stank you, Stank you smelly much
I think I'm in love again
For pickin' me up, pickin' me up out to this world (Stank you)
Hey, hey John (Very much)
Are we recording our ad libs?
I think I'm in love again
Really? Were we recording just then?
Let me hear that, that first one when I first- (Stank you very much)
I think I'm in love again (Stank you very much)
I think I'm in love againYou might also like15Embed
