Return of the “G” Lyrics

Yeah, yeah it goes like this right here
Like uh, niggas always be hollering "peace"
You know what I'm saying, "peace my brother"
Peace this, peace that, you know what I'm saying but
Every time I uh try to get a peace of mind
Niggas try to get a piece of mine
So I gotta grab my piece
It's the return of the gangster, thanks ta'
Them niggas that's on that blow that run up in your crib
Which contains your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
They do not want to hear it
Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit, get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas that think you soft and say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches, and switches, and hoes, and clothes, and weed
Let's talk about time travelin', rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin', get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that got them kids
That got enough to buy an ounce
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never
Seein' light 'til they end up being like yo' sorry ass
Robbin' niggas in broad-ass daylight get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas who get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?
When y'all gon' break up? When y'all gon' wake up?
Nigga I'm feelin' better than ever what's wrong with you
You get down!

Gangsta (it's the return, it's the return–turn–turn–turn)
Ooh (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn, it's the return, return)
Gangsta (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn)
Ooh (It's the return, it's the return–turn–turn)

Man, a nigga don't want no trouble
A playa just want to kick back with my gators off
And watch my lil' girl blow bubbles
But still ready to rhyme, standing my ground never back down
Willin' to rob steal and kill any thang that threatens mine
But good luck couldn't be bought, see
Many a fights had to be fought, G
For a nigga to ride these Vogues
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck is gon' be the first nigga we attack
Don't want that, but it comes though, most of the time when you don't know
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that slow dough
We worked for everything we have and gon' stick up for
Each other, like we brothers from another mother
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers
And never the nut huggin' punk motherfuckers
So quit spreading them rumors
We ain't Club Nouveau
Gangsta (it's the return, it's the return–turn–turn–turn)
Ooh (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn, it's the return, return)
Gangsta (It's the return–turn, it's the return–turn)
Ooh (It's the return, it's the return–turn–turn)
