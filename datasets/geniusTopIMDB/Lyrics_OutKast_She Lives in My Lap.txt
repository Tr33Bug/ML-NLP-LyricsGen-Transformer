She Lives in My Lap Lyrics
What's wrong? What are you afraid of?
The Love Below

She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
Ah, but she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
Oh, she lives in my lap (Forever my fiancée)
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
She lives in my lap (I'll get the courage one day)

Make me want you, make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are, then forget you
Girl, remind me just who we are
We're oh so close, but yet so far

Baby, why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them, I care about you
Baby, I love you
You've got me open wide (I love you)
Just come inside (baby)
It's yours (it's yours), I'm yours (I'm yours)
For sure (for sure), play, baby, play

She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
Oh, she lives in my lap (Forever my fiancée)
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
She lives in my lap (I'll get the courage one day)
