Alive Lyrics
"Son," she said, "have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy was nothing but a...
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him, but I'm glad we talked"
Oh, I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, oh
While she walks slowly across a young man's room
She said, "I'm ready for you"
Why, I can't remember anything to this very day
'Cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare
I, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive, yeah

Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

"There's something wrong", she said, well of course there is
"You're still alive," she said, oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question?
And if so, if so who answers? Who answers?
I, oh I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh I'm still alive
Yeah, I, oh I'm still alive
Yeah, I, ooh, I'm still alive!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
