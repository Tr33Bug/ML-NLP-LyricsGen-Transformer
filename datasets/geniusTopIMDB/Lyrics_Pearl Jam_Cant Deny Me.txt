Canâ€™t Deny Me LyricsAnd now you want me to breathe
And be so grateful
For the air that I need
Don't make me pitiful
And in the morning light
We're just the same, you and me
Out on the go, send officials
My propensity to breed
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You might be rich, but you can't deny me
Got nothin', got nothin' but the will to survive
You can't control and you can't deny me
Your lies are sick, they're sick and they're vile
You can't deny me
Try to talk down to me
My mind it ain't so simple
Where's your vocabulary?
Your ignorance is sinful
You plant your lying seeds
Watch as the roots take hold
The country you are now poisoning
Condition critical
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
I know it's true and you can't deny me
Got nothin', got nothin', you got nothin' to hide
Little bullshit whore, and you can't deny me
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
It's all so sick and you can't deny me
You can't deny me
You can't deny me
You don't defy me
You can't deny me
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You know you're sick and you can't deny me
Got nothin', just nothin', you got somethin' to hide
We see right through you and you can't deny me

You can't deny me1Embed
