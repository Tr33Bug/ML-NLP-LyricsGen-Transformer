Come Back Lyrics
If I keep holdin' out
Will the light shine through?
Under this broken roof
It's only rain that I feel

I've been wishing out the days
Oh, oh, oh, come back

I have been planning out
All that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away
Know that I still remain true
I've been wishing out the days
Please say, that if you hadn'ta gone now
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are
Oh, oh, come back

And these days, they linger on
And in the night, I been waitin' for
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
I go to sleep

If I don't fall apart
Will my memories stay clear?
So you had to go
And I had to remain here

But the strangest thing today
So far away and yet you feel so close
And I'm not gonna question it any other way
There must be an open door for you
Oh oh oh, to come back
You might also like
And the days, they linger on, yeah
And every night, what I'm waitin' for, oh, oh
Is the real possibility I may meet you in my dream
Sometimes you're there and you're talking back to me
Come the morning, I could swear that you're next to me
And it's okay

It's okay, it's okay

I'll be here, come back, come back
I'll be here, come back, come back
I'll be here, come back, come back
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh7Embed
