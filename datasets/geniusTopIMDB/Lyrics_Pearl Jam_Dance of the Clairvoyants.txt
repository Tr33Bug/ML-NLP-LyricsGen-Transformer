Dance of the Clairvoyants Lyrics
Confusion is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
Big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the future's no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before

The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man
Can be greater than the sum
That's not a negative thought
I'm positive, positive, positive
Falling down, not staying down
Coulda held me up rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river

Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the future's no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before

Numbers keep falling off the calendar's floor
We're stuck in our boxes
Windows open no more
Couldn't lift up the forget-me-nots
Not recalling what they're for
I'm in love with clairvoyants
'Cause they're out of this world

I know the girls wanna dance
Fall away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things

Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
(I know the girls wanna dance away their circumstance)
(I know the boys wanna grow their dicks and fix and file things)
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes8Embed
