Dissident Lyrics
She nursed him there, ooh, over a night
I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say? What to say?
But soon she was down, soon he was low
At a quarter past, a holy no

She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissidence, a dissident is here
And to this day she's glided on
Always home but so far away
Like a word misplaced
Nothing said, what a waste
But when she had contact with the conflict
There was meaning but she sold him to the state

She had to turn around

When she couldn't hold, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissidence, a dissident is here, oh!

Oh
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)

She gave him away when she couldn't hold
No, she folded, a dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissidence, a dissident is here
Oh, couldn't hold on, she couldn't hold
No, she folded, a dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place
Oh, a dissident is hereYou might also like4Embed
