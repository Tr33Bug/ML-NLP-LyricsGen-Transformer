Even Flow Lyrics
Freezin'
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin'
Maybe he'll see a little better, set of days, ooh yeah
Oh, hand out
Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ooh yeah
Oh, dark grin
He can't help, when he's happy he looks insane, hm yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again...
Kneelin'
Looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin'
Understands the weather of the winter's on its way
Oh, ceilings
Few and far between all the legal halls of shame, hey

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
...Ah, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away

Yeah!
Woo, ah yeah... fuck it up


Hey man, you got a dollar?
Come on, just some spare change, man, I know you got
Well, God bless you, man, God bless you
You might also like
Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away... yeah!
Woo, ah yeah...37Embed
