Footsteps Lyrics
Don't even think about reachin' me
I won't be home
Don't even think about stoppin' by
Don't think of me at all

I did a what I had to do
If there was a reason, it was you

Ah, I don't even think about getting inside
Voices in my head
Ooh, voices
I got scratches all over my arms
One for each day since I fell apart
I did a what I had to do
If there was a reason, it was you

A Footsteps in the hall
It was you, you
Oh, pictures on my chest
It was you
It was you

I did a what I had to do
Oh, and if a there was a reason
Oh, there wasn't no reason, no
And if there's something you'd like to do
Oh, just let me continue to blame you

A Footsteps in the hall
It was you, you
Oh, pictures on my chest
It was you, youYou might also like1Embed
