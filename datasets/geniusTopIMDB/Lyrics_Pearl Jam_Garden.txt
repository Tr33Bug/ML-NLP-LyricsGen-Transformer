Garden Lyrics
(She don't wander in here, don't wander in here, she)
(She don't wander in here, don't wander in here, she)

The direction of the eye, so misleading
The deflection of the soul, nauseously quick
I don't question our existence
I just question our modern needs
(She don't wander in here, don't wander in here, she)
(She don't wander in here)
I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face, blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone

After all is done and we're still alone
I won't be taken, yet

I'll go with my hands bound
I will walk with my face, blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone

I don't show, I don't share
I don't need, yeah, what you have to give


I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face, blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of
You might also like
I will walk with my hands, bound
I will walk, into your garden
Garden of stone!
I don't know, I don't care
I don't need you for me to live! Yeah yeah yeah
Uh-uh-uh
