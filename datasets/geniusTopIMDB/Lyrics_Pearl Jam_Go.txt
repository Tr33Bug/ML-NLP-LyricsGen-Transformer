Go Lyrics
Oh, please don't go out on me, don't go on me now
Never acted up before, don't go on me now
I swear I never took it for granted, just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you, just passing it on

Go
Fuck

Once fastened, servile, now you're getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly with such disarm
I pulled the covers over him, should have pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis, a fool not a fucking god
No
Time
Suck
My

Please, don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please... no, oh!

Suck blood
Touch, please
Tunnel vision
Tuck, time
See

Please, please, please
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please, don't you want me?
Don't go on me
Please, don't go on meYou might also like5Embed
