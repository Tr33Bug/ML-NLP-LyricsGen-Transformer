I Am Mine Lyrics
The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithin' and hopin' to buy themselves time
Me, I figure, as each breath goes by
I only own my mind

North is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in-between is mine
I am mine
And the feeling, it gets left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

The ocean is full 'cause everyone's cryin'
The full moon is lookin' for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine

And the meaning that gets left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significant, behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight

Whoo!

And the feelings that get left behind
All the innocents broken with lies
Significance between the lines
We may need to hide
You might also like
And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
We're all different behind the eyes
There's no need to hide, yeah4Embed
