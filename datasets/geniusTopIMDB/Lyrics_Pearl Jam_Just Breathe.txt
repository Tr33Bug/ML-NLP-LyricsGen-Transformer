Just Breathe Lyrics
Yes I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others they got none, uh-huh

Stay with me, oh, let's just breathe

Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
Yeah I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed
Stay with me, you're all I see

Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean

I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, uh-huh

Nothing you would take, everything you gave

Did I say that I need you?
Oh, did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean, ahâ€¦

Nothing you would take, everything you gave
Hold me 'til I die, meet you on the other sideYou might also like27Embed
