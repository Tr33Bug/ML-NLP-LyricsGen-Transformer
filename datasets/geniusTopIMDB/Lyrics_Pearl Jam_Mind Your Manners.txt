Mind Your Manners Lyrics
I've got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that I'm done believing
Now the truth is coming out
What they've taken
Is more than a vow
They've taken your innocence
And then they throw 'em on a burning pile
All along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"

I caught myself believing
That I needed God
And if it's out there somewhere
We sure could use hymn now
Try my patience
My patience tried
This world's a long love letter
That makes me want to cry, ah ah ay ay

All along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"
That's all they're saying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else
You might also like

And all along they're saying
"Mind your manners!"
Always praying
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else

Go to Heaven, that's swell
How do you like your living hell?
Go to Heaven, that's swell
How do you like your living hell?
Go to Heaven, that's swell
How do you like your living hell?
