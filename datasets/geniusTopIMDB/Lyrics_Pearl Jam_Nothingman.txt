Nothingman Lyrics
Once divided, nothing left to subtract
Some words when spoken can't be taken back
Walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking
Future's above, but in the past he's slow and sinking

Caught a bolt of lightning
Cursed the day he let it go

Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something, nothingman
She once believed in every story he had to tell
One day she stiffened, took the other side
Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
One just escapes, one's left inside the well

And he who forgets
Will be destined to remember, oh, oh, ohh

Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something, nothingman

Ooh, she don't want him (she don't want him)
Oh, she won't feed him after he's flown away

Oh, into the sun
Ah, into the sun
Burn (burn), burn, burn

Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something, nothingman

Nothingman
Coulda been something, nothingman
Uh, uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh oh9Embed
