Oceans Lyrics
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards you
Know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next

Of the next time we touch, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You don't have to stray
Though oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore

I will be, I will be there once more, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oohYou might also like5Embed
