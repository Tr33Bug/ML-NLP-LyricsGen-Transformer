Rearviewmirror Lyrics
I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize

I couldn't breathe, holding me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive
I seem to look away
The wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled

Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive, yeah

Saw things, saw things
Saw things, saw things clearer, clearer
Once you were in my rear-view mirror
I gathered speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all, I'm far away
Hard to believe, finally the shades are raised
Hey, yeah

Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you) Rear-view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you) Rear-view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you) Rear-view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
(Once you) Oh yeahYou might also like9Embed
