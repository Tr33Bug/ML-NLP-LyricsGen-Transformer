Release Lyrics
I see the world, feel the chill
Which way to go, windowsill
I see the words on a rocking horse of time
I see the birds in the rain

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain, release me
Oh, oh I
Oh, oh

Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself like you somehow
I'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
I'll open up, release me
Release me, release me, ah, release me

Oh, oh I
Oh, whoa, ah ooh, oohYou might also like19Embed
