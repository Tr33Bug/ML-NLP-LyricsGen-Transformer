Superblood Wolfmoon Lyrics
Superblood wolfmoon
Took her away too soon
Superblood wolfmoon
Took her away too soon

I can hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once you were somewhere and now you're everywhere
I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right
I ask for forgiveness, I beg of myself
Feeling angry, knock it off the shelf
Right now I feel a lack of innocence
Searching for reveal, hypnotonic resonance
I feel not much of anything
And the cause is life or death
Throughout the hopelessness, focus on your focusness
I've been hoping that our hope dies last
I don't know anything, I question everything
This life I love is going way too fast
Both my eyes are swollen, my face is broken
And I'm hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your fist

She was a stunner and I am stunned
And the first thought and second thought was "could be the one"
I was a prisoner, her keys and the cuffs
Yeah, I was feeling fortunate to be locked up
But the world kept a-spinning, always felt like it was ending
And love notwithstanding, we are each of us fucked

I would hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once you were somewhere and now you're everywhere
I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right
I ask for forgiveness, I beg of myself
Feeling angry, knock it off the shelf

Superblood wolfmoon
Took her away too soon
Superblood wolfmoon
Took her away too soon
Superblood wolfmoon
Took her away too soon

I can hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once you were somewhere and now you're everywhere
I'm feeling selfish and I want what's right

Focus on your focusness, don't allow for hopelessness
I've been hoping that our hope dies last
I don't know anything, I question everything
This life I love is going way too fastEmbed
