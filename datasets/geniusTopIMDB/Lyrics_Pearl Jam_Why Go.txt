Why Go Lyrics
She scratches a letter into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday another child won't feel as alone as she does
It's been two years and counting since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed by some stupid fuck and mommy agrees

Why go home? Why go home?
Why go home?

She seems to be stronger but what they want her to be is weak
She could play pretend, she could join the game, boy
She could be another clone
Ooh! Ah! Ah yeah
Why go home? Why go home?
Why go home? Why go home?
What you taught (Why go home?)
Put me here (Why go home?)
Don't come visit (Why go home?)
Mother, sing me (Why go home?)


Why go home? Why go home?
Why go home? Why go home?
What you taught me (Why go home?)
Put me here (Why go home?)
Don't come visit (Why go home?)
Mother, mother, yeah (Why go home?)
Why go home? Why go home?
Why go home? Why go home?
Why go home? Why go home?
Why go home?
