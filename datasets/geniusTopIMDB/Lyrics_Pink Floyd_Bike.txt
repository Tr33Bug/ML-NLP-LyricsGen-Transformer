TranslationsNederlandsBike Lyrics
I’ve got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It’s got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
I’d give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing

I’ve got a cloak, it’s a bit of a joke
There’s a tear up the front
It’s red and black, I’ve had it for months
If you think it could look good then I guess it should
You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing

I know a mouse, and he hasn’t got a house
I don’t know why I call him Gerald
He’s getting rather old, but he’s a good mouse

You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing

I’ve got a clan of gingerbread men
Here's a man, there's a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish, they’re on the dish

You’re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I’ll give you anything, everything if you want thing
I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let’s go into the other room and make them work
