TranslationsEspañolDon’t Leave Me Now Lyrics
Ooh, babe, don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder in front of my friends

Oh, babe, don't leave me now
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
(Need you, need you, need you, need you, need you, need you)
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

Oh, babe, don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe, why are you running away?

Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
