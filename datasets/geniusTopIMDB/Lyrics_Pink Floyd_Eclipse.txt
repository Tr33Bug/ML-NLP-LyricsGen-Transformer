All that you touch and all that you see
All that you taste, all you feel
And all that you love and all that you hate
All you distrust, all you save
And all that you give (all you give) and all that you deal
And all that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal (Hey-ey)
And all you create and all you destroy (Ooooh)
And all that you do and all that you say (Heeeey-yeah)
And all that you eat and everyone you meet (Everyone you meet)
And all that you slight and everyone you fight (Hooooo)
And all that is now and all that is gone
And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune (Everything)
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon
There is no dark side in the moon really
Matter of fact, it's all dark
