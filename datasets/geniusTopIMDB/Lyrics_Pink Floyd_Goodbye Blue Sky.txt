Look, Mummy!
There's an airplane up in the sky
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
Did-did-did-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
