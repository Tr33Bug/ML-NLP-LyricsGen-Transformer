TranslationsNederlandsIs There Anybody Out There? Lyrics
”Well, only got an hour of daylight left, better get started. Isn't it unsafe to travel at night? It'll be a lot less safe to stay here. Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long. Can Lorca ride? He'll have to ride. Lorca, time to go! Chengra, thank you for everything. Let's go. Goodbye, Chengra, Goodbye, Missy! I'll be back one day”
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?

Ah, is there anybody out there?
