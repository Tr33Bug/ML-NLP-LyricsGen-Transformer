Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh-ah, Mother, should I build the wall?

Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh-ah, is it just a waste of time?
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm

Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall


Mother, do you think she's good enough… For me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous… To me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh-ah, Mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
You might also like
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
You'll always be “baby” to me

Mother, did it need to be so high?30Embed
