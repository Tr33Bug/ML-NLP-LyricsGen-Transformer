TranslationsNederlandsPigs (Three Different Ones) Lyrics
*Pig snorts*

Big man, pig man
Haha, charade you are
Wooh!
You well-heeled big wheel
Haha, charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You're nearly a good laugh, almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying, “Keep on digging”
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?
You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry

Bus stop rat bag
Haha, charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Haha, charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You're nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You're hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a handgun

You're nearly a laugh
You're nearly a laugh, but you're really a cry


Hey you, Whitehouse
Haha, charade you are
You house-proud town mouse
Haha, charade you are
You're trying to keep our feelings off the street
You're nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
…! …! …! …! …! …! …! You
Gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside
You might also like
Mary, you're nearly a treat
Mary, you're nearly a treat, but you're really a cry
