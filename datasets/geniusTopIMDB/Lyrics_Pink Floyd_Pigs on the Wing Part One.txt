TranslationsNederlandsPigs on the Wing (Part One) Lyrics
If you didn't care what happened to me
And I didn't care for you
We would zigzag our way through the boredom and pain
Occasionally glancing up through the rain
Wondering which of the buggers to blame
And watching for pigs on the wingYou might also like19Embed
