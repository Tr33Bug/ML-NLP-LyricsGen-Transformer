TranslationsNederlandsVera Lyrics
"Where the hell are you?
"Where the hell are you, Simon?" *Shots*
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again some sunny day?
Vera, Vera, what has become of you?
Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?You might also like4Embed
