(Ah) I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock-and-roll refugee
Ooh, baby, set me free
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
