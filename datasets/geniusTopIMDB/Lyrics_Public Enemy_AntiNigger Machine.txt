Anti-Nigger Machine Lyrics*begins with 1 minute and 51 seconds of samples and instrumentals*

Drop it!

When I'm talkin' rhyme time
It's blow your mind time some say
It's nothing worse than a verse
To hear some nigga curse
They call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
Claimin' I boast and smoke
And sometimes sing the blues
I twang metal and settle
Try to never back pedal
From the power some got
To get a nigga shot
The null and void I avoid
I test the paranoid
Never had to be bad
My mama raised me mad
So what I got is hot
I love my life a lot
I'm never sad just glad
That's why I thank my dad
Naw, I ain't with this
I ain't with it
I ain't with it
This is what I mean a anti-nigga machine

Instead of peace the police
Just wanna wreck and flex
On the kid
What I did was try to be the best
So they fingered the trigger
Figured I was a bigger nigga
And they started to search me
So I headed West
Went to Cali a rally
Was for a brother's death
It was the fuzz who shot him
And not the bloods or cuzz
I wondered why it was like
So I just held my mic
But in my mind I was blind
So I just tried to find
A reason we was
Just the way that we was
So I just stayed in the crib
Until I got a buzz...

What man, what? What is it, man?
(It's Kane, G)
Yeah, boy! What's up, G?
(Yo man, me and Ice Cube got this movie in effect you with it?)
