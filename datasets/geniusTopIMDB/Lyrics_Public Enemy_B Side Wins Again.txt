B Side Wins Again Lyrics
So here we go y'all
Little by little you know
We got the power
And the knowledge to move 'em
And still rock
A super song for the cause so...
Feel the load on your brain for the episode
And we just begun, it's number one y'all
Brother Black, the B is back
So check this out
And 'ya don't, I won't, if 'ya still, I will
Take 3 jams and hold 'em, this what I told 'em
Rock the other side, the sucker lied
Said he would shock but never tried, and so I
Took 'em away, I never stayed y'all
I called Flavor Flav, another record to get played
He made a jam to get you slammed
Back to back in the place where the suckers are basin'
Whatever it takes to make it hardcore
We gonna roll it raw
That's what you buy it for, c'mon
You roll in your ride, the DJ decides
To play it on the radio, the A side
He gives it a try but never really gives it a try
And the people request the best on the B side

Food for the brain, beats for the feet
People on the dance floor never claimin' a receipt
Had a good time rockin' rollin' on the go rhyme
The rhythm supplied by the superior B side
They had to twist and turn and shout
Turn the jam out, getcha ready now, c'mon
The situation put you in
To where you're sweatin' in
Hysterical B side, c'mon inside
I quest the best to give a test
And never given a rest
Your guess is good as my guess
And while I'm guessin' your guessin', yo listen this is..
A DJ to play to give a lesson
And his name is Terminator X
You might also like
And the suckers on the right get cynical
'Cause the record's to the left and political
And you search the stores
Attack the racks with your claws
For the rebels without a pause
'Cause the B side
Wins again, again, again
Yo Black, some of you are all in
To make sure the crowd
Get loud wit' it on the dance floor
'Cause the B is pure sure
I never knew the crowd was this hype
But you thought we was that type
To start a riot, we ain't quiet
In a thunderstorm with a song
Why would we dare you to come along
Pump up the music, pump the sound
Once again we gonna do it like this now
And while I'm throwin', you're goin'
And you know it's time for man on a mission
To listen cause he's in the house
He's Terminator XEmbed
