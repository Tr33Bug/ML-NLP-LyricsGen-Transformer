Bring tha Noise (Remix) Lyrics
(Yeah, boy)
Bass, how low can you go?
Death row what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The uncannable D, Public Enemy number one
Five-O said "Freeze" and I got numb
Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell
'Cause a brother like me said, "Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do"
Follow for now, power to the people say
"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out (Yeah, y'all, come on)
Here we go again
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside
Music that the critics are all blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now
Across the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait 'til we get it right
Radio stations, I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this

Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise
You might also like
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock 'n' roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its own feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last, why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear-hear-hear-hear, hear the, hear the
Hear-hear-hear, hear the drum, hear the drum
Hear the drummer get wicked
