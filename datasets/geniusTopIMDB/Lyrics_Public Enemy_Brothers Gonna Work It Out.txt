Brothers Gonna Work It Out Lyrics
“The rhythm, the rebel”
“Don’t believe the hype!”
“Yes!”
“How low can you go?”
“Show ‘em that we can do this!”
“Here we go again”

Uh, your bad self
Help us break this down from off the shelf
Here's a music servin' you so use it
Papa got a brand new funk
Get down (Party for your right!)
Huh, let's get it on like we said before
They say the brothers causing trouble
Hate to bust their bubble
'Cause we rumble from our lower level
To condition your condition, we're gonna do a song
That you never heard before
Make you all jump along to the education
Brothers gonna work it out
And stop chasing
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out
You got it...what it takes
Go get it...where you want it?
Go get it...get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

So many of us in limbo
How to get it on, it's quite simple
Three stones from the sun
We need a piece of this rock
Our goal indestructible soul
Answers to this quizzing
To the Brothers in the street
Schools and the prisons
History shouldn't be a mystery
Our stories real history
Not his story
We gonna work it one day
Till we all get paid
The right way in full, no bull
Talking, no walking, driving, arriving and stylin'
Tell 'em -- soon you'll see what I'm talking 'bout
'Cause one day
The brothers gonna work it out
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out
You might also like
You got it...what it takes
Go get it...where you want it?
Go get it...get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

Let's get it on... we are willing
Let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willing
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willing
Now we are ready if you are ready
Yo, drop the rhyme in overtime, G

In 1995, you'll twist to this
As you raise your fist to the music
United we stand, yes divided we fall
Together we can stand tall
Brothers that try to work it out
They get mad, revolt, revise, realize
They're super bad
Small chance a smart brother's
Gonna be a victim of his own circumstance
Sabotaged, shell-shocked, rocked and ruled
Day in the life of a fool
Like I said before to live it low
Life take you time, time yo go slow
Look here, not a thing to fear
Brother to brother, not another as sincere
Teach a man how to be father
To never tell a woman he can't bother
You can't say you don't know
What I'm talking 'bout
But one day ... brothers gonna work it out
You got it...what it takes
Go get it...where you want it?
Go get it...get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

Let's get it on... we are willing
Let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willing
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willing2Embed
