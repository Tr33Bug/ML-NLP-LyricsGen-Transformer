Can’t Do Nuttin’ For Ya Man Lyrics
Runnin' for your life, by the knife
Runnin' from your wife, yikes!
You should've stuck with home
Off your mind to blow your dome
It was you that chose your doom
You built the maze you can't get through
I tried to help you all I can
Now I can't do nuttin' for you man

I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You got all these people on your back now
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
Flavor Flav got problems of his own
I can't do nuttin' for you man
Go lean on Shell's Answer Man
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam
Makin' love to wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night
Cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
Uzi down the bullets in the gun
Just microwave themselves a ton
Lord, you tried to help them all they can
But they couldn't do nuttin' for ya man

I can't do nuttin' for ya man
They couldn't do nuttin' for you man
Yo G, listen

Flavor Flav is the sun
Public Enemy number one
Gotcha runnin' from the gun (Pow!)
Of a brain that weighs a ton
Can't face my facts that's on the shelf
Cause you want a handout for your wealth
Eatin' welfare turkey out the can
I can't do nuttin' for ya man

I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You want six dollars for what?
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You better, man, kiss my butt
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
I'm busy tryin' to do for me!
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
That's the way the ball bounces, G
You might also like
Bass for your face
Yo man
I can’t do nuttin'
Nuttin' for ya
I tried to tell ya
Rock that shit homey
Yo G, listen
I ain’t tryin to hear that
Kick that shit
You on welfare
Your mother got gold nipples
You got a rip in your couch
Wash your butt
(Kick that shit)
