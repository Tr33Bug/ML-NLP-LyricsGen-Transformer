Caught, Can We Get a Witness? Lyrics
Somebody in the house, say, "Yeah!"
"Yeah!"
If y'all really like to rock the funky beats, somebody in the house, say, "Hell yeah!"
"Hell yeah!"
I like that for the people up top, check this out:

"Order in the court"

Yo, I can't believe they got the P.E. in court before the judge on some nonsense
I got the S1s ready
Chuck, Flav, what's up?
Get caught, now in court 'cause I stole a beat
This is a sampling sport
But I'm giving it a new name, what you hear is mine
P.E., you know the time
Now, what in the heaven does a jury know about?
Hell, if I took it, but they just look at me
Like, "Hey, I'm on a mission, check it out, y'all: condition"
Ain't right, sittin' like dynamite
Goin' to blow you up, and it just might
Blow up the bench and
Judge, the courtroom, plus, I gotta mention
This court is dismissed
When I grab the mic
Yo, Flav...

What is this?
What y'all think y'all doin', bringin' us to court for this time to say we're stealin' beats?
Y'all can't copyright no beats, man
Yo, Chuck, is their claim real?

Get hyped, c'mon, we gotta
Gather around - gotcha
Mail from the courts and jail
Claims I stole the beats that I rail
Look at how I'm livin' like
And they're gonna check the mike, right? - Sike
C'mon, 'cause I'm livin' now, lower than low
What a sucker know
Found this mineral that I call a beat
Paid zero
Packed the load 'cause it's better than gold
People don't ask the price, 'cause it sold
They say that I sample
But they should sample this: my pit bull
We ain't goin' for this, they say that I stole this
Can I get a witness?
Understand where we're goin'
Then listen to this, plus my Roland
Comin' from down from below
Rebound, c'mon, boost up the stereo
Snakes in the morning
Wake up scared, afraid of my warning
They claim that I'm violent
Now I choose to be silent, can I get a witness?

Yo, Griff
Move the S1s out on the judge and the jury
Hold them hostage
Time for Terminator X to step in and show 'em that he's in effect, boy
Yeah, ha ha
Cold Medina, ha ha
Hey, yo, Terminator, don't hurt 'em, man
Hey, yo, Griff, hold them hostage, boy
..
Ignorance is at an all-time high
Yo, Chuck, I think they need to be educated
S1s, take a stand
Yo, Chuck, stand up to 'em
Kick it

C'mon, get wit' it
Something ain't right, I got to admit it
Made me mad when I was on tour
That I declared war on black radio
They say that I planned this
On the radio most of you will demand this
Won't be on a playlist
Bust the way that I say this: No sell out
Yeah
Hey, huh --yeah, fellas, do you we think we gonna sell out?
Nah, man
I said, "Do you think we gonna sell out?"
No!
That's 'cause we ain't caught
Yo, Flav, do you think we gonna sell out?
I know if we do, we get the hell out
Uh-huh - yo, Griff, you and the S1s, do you think we gonna sell out?
No, not in this damn time, my brother
Uh-huh, Terminator X, hey, do you think we gonna sell out?


You singers are spineless
As you sing your senseless songs to the mindless
Your general subject, love, is minimal
It's sex for profit
Scream that I sample
For example, Tom, you ran to the federal
Court in U.S. it don't mean you
Yeah, 'cause they fronted on you
The posse's ready, Terminator X, yes, he's ready
The S1Ws, Griff, are you ready?

They say that I stole this
I rebel with a raised fist, can we get a witness?
