Cold Lampinâ€™ with Flavor Lyrics
"I guarantee you, no more music by the suckers
No more music by the suckers
No more music by the suckers"

Yo, man, what do he mean by suckers, man?
Yo, we only trying to put a black eye in the game
But, yo, we gonna let you put a black eye in the game
Boy, you know what I'm sayin?
Yeeah, boy, ha ha
Cold medina, cold medina
Rocking a beat to the strength
Yeah, boy, I got a solo, boy
That's right, Flavor goin' solo
What y'all know about that?
Yo, we gonna kick the flavor like this
Yo, bust this out
I'm lamping, I'm lamping, I'm cold, cold lamping
I got Louie's boy, I'm not tramping
I just came from the crib, you know?
I'm on the go, throw your tank into metro
Live lyrics from the bank of reality
I kick the flyest dope maneuver technicality
To a dope track, you wanna hike, get your backpack
Get out the wack sack
I'm in my Flavmobile cold lamping
I took a G upstate cold camping
To the Poconos, we call a hideaways
A pack of franks and a big bag of Frito-Lays

Flavor Flav on a hype tip
I'm your hype drink, come take a big sip
I'm in position, you can't play me out the pocket
I'll take the dopest beat you got, and I'll rock it
Like chocolate, even vanilla
Chocolate, strawberry, sarsaparilla
Flavors are electric, tryin' to get a shocker
Didn't I tell you to leave Flavor Flav alone, knocker?
A clock on my chest proves I don't 'fess
I'm a clocker rocker, rocking with the rest
Flav in the house by Chuck D's side
Chuck got the Flavor, Flav don't hide
P.E. crazy, crazy P.E
Making crazy Louie's for the shopping spree
You're eating dirt 'cause you like getting dirt from the graveyard
You put gravy on it
Then you pick your teeth with tombstone chips
Casket cover clips, dead women hips you do the bump with
Bones, nothing but love bones
Lifestyles of the living dead, first you live, then you're dead
Died trying to clock what I said
Now I got a murder rap 'cause I bust a cap with Flavor
Pure Flavor
You might also like
We got Magnum Brown, Shooshki Palooshki
Supercalafragahestikalagoothki
You could put that in your don't-know-what-you-said book
Took-look-yuk-duk-wuk
Innovative ill factors by the Flavor Flav
Come and ride the Flavor wave
In any year on any given day
What a brother know, what do Flavor say?
Why do the record play that way?
Prime time merrily in the day
Right now this radio station is busy
Brain knowledgeably wizzy
Honey drippers, you say you got it
You ain't got no flavor, and I can prove it
Flavor Flav, the flav all of flavors
Onion and garlic French-fried potatoes
Make your breath stink, breathe fire
Make any onion the best crier
I know it sounds crazy, but it fits perfect
Peter perfect picked a perfect Peter
Honey dripper, sucker sipper, big dipper, sucker dripper
Dripping suckers till it's going out of style
Creating suckers for the Flavor Flav pile
Flavor Flav, the flavor of the pile
Lamping boy Medina style
Kicking the flavor, getting busy
You're going out, I think you're dizzy
I think you're hungry 'cause you're starving for Flavor
Flavor most, put it on your toast
Eat it and taste it and swallow it down
Imperial Flavor gives you the crown
Of the king called Flavor, the king of all flavors
Rolls and rolls and rolls of life savers
Flavor Flav is in everything you eat
'Cause everything you eat got flavor
Flavor Flav is the first taste you get in the morning
Your breakfast is the flavor
In between that your lunch, in between that your dinner
In between that your midnight flavor
That's right, boy2Embed
