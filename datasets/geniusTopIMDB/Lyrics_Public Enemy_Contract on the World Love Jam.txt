Contract on the World Love Jam Lyrics


Some foreign power, some group of terrorists
Some individual concern
Fight–fighting an enemy
Fight–fight–fighting–fighting–fight–fighting an enemy
The race that controls the past, controls the living present
And therefore, the future
Brrrrrr!
The future of the group is in doubt
Wow!
And they claim that it's the music
The future of the group is in doubt
Wow!
And they claim that it's the music
Lyrics have–Lyric–Lyrics have been rather controversial
Controversy– Controversy in– Controversy in the rap world
(God-damn)
The question is whether or not we are free as people
(Get off)
The question is–
What it– What it is?
Having an Afrocentric point of view
If you don't know your past, then you don't know your future
Word!
There is something changing in the climate of consciousness on this planet today
Public Enemy
