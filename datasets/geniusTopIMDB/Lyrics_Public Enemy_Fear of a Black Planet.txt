Fear of a Black Planet Lyrics
Where is Public Enemy? What's the big deal?
What's your latest hit, brother?
(Fear of a Black Planet)

Man, don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Bout your daughter, nope she's not my type
(But suppose she said she loved me?)
Are you afraid of the mix of Black and White?
Livin' in a land where the law say
Mixing of race makes the blood impure
She's a woman I'm a man
Look at your face, I see ya can't stand it

Man you need to calm down, don't get mad
I don't need your sista
But suppose she said she loved me?
Would you still love her or would you dismiss her?
What is pure? Who is pure?
Is it European? I ain't sure
If the whole world was to come through peace and love
Then what would we be made of?

Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know White comes from Black
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose?

Man, I don't want your wife
Stop screamin', it's not the end of your life
(But suppose she said she loved me?)
What's wrong with some color in your family tree?
I don't know, hey, I'm just a rhyme sayer
Skins protected 'gainst the ozone layers
Breakdown, 2001
Might be best to be Black or just Brown, countdown
You might also like

I've been wonderin' why people livin' in fear of my shade
(Or my high-top fade)
I'm not the one that's runnin', but they got me on the run
Treat me like I had a gun
All I got is genes and chromosomes
Consider me Black to the bone
All I want is peace and love on this planet
Ain't how that God planned it?

Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know White comes from Black
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose?Embed
