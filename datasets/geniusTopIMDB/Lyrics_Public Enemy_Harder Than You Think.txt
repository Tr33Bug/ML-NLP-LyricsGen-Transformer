Harder Than You Think Lyrics
Yo, Chuck, bust a move, man
I was on my way up here to the studio
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
And this brother stopped me and asked me, "Yo, wassup with that brother, Chuckie D? He swear he nice"
I said "Yo, the brother don't swear he's nice, he knows he's nice"
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
So Chuck, I got a feelin you turning him into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me
On the way out to LA Laurelton Queens?
While we was in the car on our way to the Shop?
Well yo, right now kick the bass for them brothers
And let 'em know
What goes on!
Rolling Stones of the rap game, not bragging
Lips bigger than Jagger, not saggin'
Spell it backwards, I'ma leave it at that
That ain't got nothing to do with rap
Check the facts, expose those cats
Who pose as heroes and take advantage of blacks
Your government's gangster, so cut the crap
A war going on so where y'all at?
"Fight the Power" comes great responsibility
'F the Police' but who's stopping you from killing me?
Disaster, fiascos over a loop by P.E
If it's an I instead of we believing TV
Spitting riches, bitches, and this new thing about snitches
Watch them asses move as the masses switches
System dissed them but barely missed her
My sole intention to save my brothers and sisters

Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
You might also like
Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You got to tell 'em "Just like dat," ya know what I'm sayin?
Cause yo, lemme tell you a lil something man
These brothers runnin around, hard-headed!
They get a lil jealous, you know what I'm sayin?
Just like that! You know, they try to bring you down wit 'em
But yo, Chuck, you got to tell 'em, "Just like dat!"

Screamin gangsta twenty years later
Of course endorsed while consciousness faded
New generation believin them fables
"Gangster Boogie" on two turntables
Show no love so it's easy to hate it
Desecrated while the coroner waited
Any given Sunday, so where y'all rate it?
Wit slavery, lynchin, and them drugs infiltrated
I'm like that doll Chucky, baby
Keep comin back to live, love life like I'm crazy
Keep it movin Rising to the Top
Doug Fresh clean livin you don't stop
Revolution means change, don't look at me strange
So I can't repeat what other rappers be sayin
You don't stand for something, you fall for anything
Harder than you think, it's a beautiful thing
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat

Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You got to tell 'em, "Just like dat," ya know what I'm sayin?
Cause yo, lemme tell you a lil something man
These brothers runnin around, hard-headed!
They get a lil jealous, you know what I'm sayin?
Just like that! You know, they try to bring you down wit 'em
But yo, Chuck, you got to tell 'em, "Just like dat!"

So it's time to leave you a preview
So you too can review what we do
Twenty years in this business, How You Sell Soul?
G-Wiz, people bear witness
Thank you for lettin us be ourselves
So don't mind me if I repeat myself
These simple lines be good for your health
To keep them crime rhymes on the shelf
Live love life like you just don't care
Five thousand leaders never scared
"Bring the Noise," it's 'the moment they feared'
Get up! Still a beautiful idea

Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat
Hard (Get up!)
Just like dat

(Get up!)
Throw yo hands in the air
Get up and show no fear!
Get up if y'all really care!
P.E. 20 years, now get up!!
