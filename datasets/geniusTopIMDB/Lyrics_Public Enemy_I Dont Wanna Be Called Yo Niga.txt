I Donâ€™t Wanna Be Called Yo Niga LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo-ho!
Yo nigga! Yo nigga! No nigga!
Yo my nigga! No nigga! No nigga!
Check it out!

How can you say to me, "Yo, my nigga!"
Cursin' up a storm, with your finger on the trigger?
Stealin' all the dough like a big gold digger
Take a small problem, make a small problem bigger
Say yo, I ain't poor, I got dough
You don't consider me your brother no more?
Goddamn kilogram, how do you figure?
I don't want to be called "yo nigga"!
Yo nigga! Yo my nigga! Yo nigga! Hey!
Yo nigga! Yo nigga! Yo my nigga!
Yo nigga!

I tried to make my statement stick like flypapers
Judge says to me, "Yo nigga, sign these goddamn papers"
My boss told me, "Yo nigga, you're fired!"
Cause my body told me, "Yo nigga, you're tired"
Yo nigga this, and yo nigga that
I'm yo nigga now cause your head got fat
Flav's framalama boy you won't figure
Why I don't wanna be called "yo nigga"

Yo nigga! Yo my nigga! Yo nigga!
Nnigga! No, nigga! No, my nigga!
No, my nigga!
Break it down

N-I-G-G-E-R
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
Everybody sayin' it, everybody playin' it
Load it on the scale, 'cause everybody weighin' it
Toby say, "Yo, I be good nigga
"Nigga get a shovel, nigga be good digger!"
I don't care how small or bigger
I don't want to be called "yo nigga"

One minute worth of shit
Yo, this is it
I wanna talk about us and us
Disgusted at the Uncle Toms
Droppin' bombs in the hood
Sellout niggas, selling drugs
And how could you love living in the projects?
Getting checks, and giving it back to the government
Bust yo ass to pay the rent
And lets look at that word, "project"
Another word for "experiment"
One side of the streets is a church
Across the road is a liquor store
Both of them keeping us poor
Keeping us down, my hood ain't considered a town
And the joint
Packed back to back with black
Full of brothers doing a bid
Who did something but did not think
And a college of forward black thinkers
Who ain't doin' a damn thing collectively
And the negro, where the fuck does he go?
'Cause right here is apartheid, he can run, but he can't hide2Embed
