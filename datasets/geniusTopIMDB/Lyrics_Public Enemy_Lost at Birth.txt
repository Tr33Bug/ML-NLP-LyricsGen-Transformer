Lost at Birth Lyrics
"The future holds nothing else but confrontation"
Clear the way for the S, the S1W's
("Kickin' like Bruce Lee, kickin' like Bruce Lee, kickin' like Bruce Lee's")
Clear the way for the S, the S1W's
("Kickin' like Bruce Lee, kickin' like Bruce, kickin' like Bruce Lee's")
Clear the way for the S, the S1W's
("Kickin' like Bruce Lee, kickin' like Bruce Lee, kickin' like Bruce Lee's")
Clear the way for the S, the S1W's
("Kickin' like Bruce Lee, kickin' like Bruce Lee, kickin' like Bruce Lee's 'Chinese Connection'")
Get back 'cause he wax the tracks, the Terminator
"Can I kick it? Can I kick it? Can I kick it?"
Get back 'cause he wax the tracks, the Terminator
("I shall not have no other one but this one")
Get back 'cause he wax the tracks, the Terminator
("Take it one step further, take it one step further")
Get back 'cause he wax the tracks, the Terminator
("Ain't gonna rain no more, no more, it ain't gonna rain no more. This is a recording, this is a recording")
It’s the Flavor, it’s the Flavor
Life saver, it’s the Flavor
It’s the Flavor, it’s the Flavor
Life saver, it’s the Flavor
It’s the Flavor, it’s the Flavor
Life saver, it’s the Flavor
It’s the Flavor, it’s the Flavor
Life saver, it’s the Flavor
("Hear ye, hear ye. And all that")
On time, get it down to pump, the Hard Rhymer
("Once again, back is the incredible")
On time, get it down to pump, the Hard Rhymer
("Once again, back is the incredible")
On time, get it down to pump, the Hard Rhymer
("Rhyme animal, the uncannable, D, Public Enemy Number One")
On time, get it down to pump, the Hard Rhymer
("Black is back, black is back")
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Engaging on the stage, on a track, t ell Jack stay in the back
I was born
Every level I'm on, you're warned
Just in case you forgot, I pump in kilowatts
To let 'em know which direction
To go what's up I wanna know
I test the front row
Forgiven the giving while the living is living it up
So many people are sleeping while standing up
Not dressed to impress or fess it
That's it test to the brain like FedEx
Treated one and the same beause the name of the game
Don't give 'em checks above necks
Some don't realize we're on the same side
Subdity in the city, suburbs or projects
But we're living in a different time
Some speed, some lead while some just pump rhymes
Then again we're all in the same gang
Info to flow and heal all below
Let's go and find the piece of mind that's taken
Or else the black starts breakin'
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
