Meet the G That Killed Me Lyrics
Every black person who says that they're a leader needs to pen blazing questions about HIV
And get an answer to the question "How could it be in a book published in 1969?"
Under chemical and biological warfare
Tell 'em

Man to man, I don't know if they can
From what I know, the parts don't fit (Ah shit)
How he's sharin' a needle with a drug addict
He don't believe he has it (Either)
But now he does, he doesn't know
'Cause he goes straight to a ho
Tell you what who was next on the butt
Wild thingin' on a germ runnin' wild
Yo stop! But the bag popped
Damn!
Yo, Terminator man, yo meet the G that killed meYou might also like1Embed
