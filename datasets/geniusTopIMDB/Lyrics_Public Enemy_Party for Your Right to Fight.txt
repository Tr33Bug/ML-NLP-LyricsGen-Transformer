Party for Your Right to Fight Lyrics
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)

Power and equality, and I'm out to get it
I know some of you ain't with it
This party started right in sixty-six
With a pro-Black radical mix
Then at the hour of twelve
Some force cut the power and emerged from hell
It was your so-called government that made this occur
Like the grafted devils they were
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)

J. Edgar Hoover, and he coulda proved to you
He had King and X set up
Also the party with Newton, Cleaver and Seale
He ended, so get up
Time to get 'em back (You got it)
Get back on the track (You got it)
Word from the honorable Elijah Muhammad
Know who you are to be Black (Boy)

"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)

"Party for your right"
"Fight, fight"
"Party for your right"
"Fight, fight"
You might also like
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)

To those that disagree, it causes static
For the original Black Asiatic man
Cream of the earth and was here first
And some devils prevent this from being known
But you check out the books they own
Even Masons, they know it
But refuse to show it, yo
But it's proven and fact
And it takes a nation of millions to hold us back

"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)

"Party for your right"
"Fight, fight"
"Party for your right"
"Fight, fight"
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)

"Party for your right"
"Fight, fight"
"Party for your right"
"Fight, fight"

"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight! (Yeah, y'all!)
"Yeah, yeah" (Yeah, y'all!)
Party for your right to fight!3Embed
