Pollywanacraka Lyrics
She wants a lover right now
But not no brother
Her man gotta have a lot of money
To get under her cover
Now she's a fine sister
But up here she's missin' it
She says she wanna learn about life
Not old black bull shit
At the age of 15, a brother gave her a baby
She's 19 now and it drove her crazy
That's why every time she turns around
All the people in the neighborhood
Look and get mad and sing
Polly!
Polly wanna
Polly!
Polly wanna
That's what they say
Polly!
Polly wanna

Meet Mr. Successful, I guess he's blessed yeah
But he happens to be a brother who only wants blue eyes and blonde hair
Now this young mister, he don't like sisters
He couldn't find that special one, we know why he missed her
He says sisters wasn't good enough
They only wanted his green stuff
That's why every time he turned around
All the people in the neighborhood looked and got mad and sang

Polly!
Polly wanna
Polly wanna

I try to tell my people
There should not be any hatred
For a brother or a sister
Whose opposite race they've mated
Cus' no man is God
And God put us all here (yeah)
But this system has no wisdom
The devil split us in pairs
And taught us White is good, Black is bad
And Black and White is still too bad
That's why everytime I turn around
All the people in my neighborhood
Look and get mad and sing
You might also like
Polly wanna!
Lord have mercy
Peace be upon us
Polly wanna!
And you and you too
Get it together!2Embed
