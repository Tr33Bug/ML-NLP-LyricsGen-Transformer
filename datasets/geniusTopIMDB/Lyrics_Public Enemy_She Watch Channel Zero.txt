She Watch Channel Zero?! Lyrics
You're blind, baby
You're blind from the facts on who you are
'Cause you're watching that garbage
The woman makes the men all pause
And if you got a woman, she might make you forget yours
There's a five-letter word to describe her character
But her brain's being washed by an actor
And every real man that tries to approach
Come the closer he comes, he gets dissed like a roach
I don't think I can handle she goes channel to channel
Cold looking for that hero, she watch channel zero

She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
Zero

Yo' baby, you got to cut that garbage off
Yo! I wanna watch the game
What is you doing?
Hey yo, let me tell you a little something
I'mma take all your soaps, and then I'm gonna hang 'em on a rope
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause that garbage you're watching don't make no sense
Hey yo, let me tell you a little something, baby
I'mma take your set, and I'mma throw it out the window, G!

2, 7, 5, 4, 8, she watched, she said
All added up to zero, and nothing in her head
She turns and turns and she hopes the soaps
Are for real, she learns that it ain't true, nope
But she won't survive and rather die in a lie
Fall a fool for some dude on a tube

I don't think I can handle she goes channel to channel
Cold looking for that hero, she watch channel zero

She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
Zero

Yo, baby, you think I'm joking? Do I look like I'm joking?
I ain't joking, word up, baby
Yo, cut that garbage off now
Yo, I got the Tyson fight on, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, so you can't be coming here, staganating like that, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, we getting ready to watch the Super Bowl
We got a black quarterback, so step back!
Trouble vision for a sister 'cause I know she don't know, I quote
Her brain's been trained by a twenty-four inch remote
Revolution a solution for all of our children
But her children don't mean as much as the show, I mean
Watch her worship the screen and fiend
For a TV ad, and it just makes me mad

I don't think I can handle she goes channel to channel
Cold looking for that hero, she watch channel zero

She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
She watch, she watch, she watch, she watch
Zero

Yo, baby, can't you see that's nonsense you watching?
Look, don't nobody look like that, nobody even live that, you know what I'm saying?
You watching garbage, nothing but garbage, straight up garbage
Yo, why don't you just back up from the TV, read a book or something?
Read about yourself, learn your culture, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, let me tell you a little something

You're blind, baby
You're blind from the facts on who you are
'Cause you're watching that garbage
...
You're blind, baby5Embed
