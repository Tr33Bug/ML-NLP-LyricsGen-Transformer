Sophisticated Bitch Lyrics
That woman in the corner, cold playin' the role
Leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold
Knowin' for a fact, that girl is whack
If you hold your hand out, she'll turn her back
Better walk, don't talk, she's all pretend
Can't be her friend unless you spend
Wall to wall, after all
Get ready to throw only money at the bitch
'Cause she thinks she's
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)

Peekin' and seekin' inside a book
Her demands for a man with a chemical look
Wishes and desires, getting worse with age
She don't want a man, all she wants is a page
Ain't got a man so she goes to a club
She think it's classy but it's really a pub
But that's the kind of place where she likes to go
The bitch got a problem
'Cause she thinks she's

So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)

Jackets, shoes, everyday ties
The girl only wants one of those guys
Suckers who front like it ain't no thing
Pretend to be friends, don't want that thang
Talk like this, uh don't talk slang
Do anything to get that thang
Tries to be chic and playin' it off
Peekin' through the window, I saw her take her clothes off
Nasty girl, a stone cold freak
Stayin' in the bed a whole goddamn week
Comin' and leavin' guys servin' up storms
From execs with checks, boys from the dorms
Never kept a name, never seen a face
She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place
I know she's a ho so I'ma go
Expose the funky bitch
'Cause she thinks she's
You might also like
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)

Now she wants a sucker boy with an attache
And if you ain't got it, she'll turn you away
You can smile with style as you profile
'Cause you got a gold tooth and she thinks you're wild
She don't want a brother that's true and black
If you're light, you're alright, better you stay back
'Cause the sucker with the bag is out the cat
With somethin' in his bag keepin' her attached
The man got a plan, it's IBM
The devil at her level, yes it is him
His Audi she rides, his gold and clothes
The ill base method, turnin' up her nose
Lack a lack a lack, cold beamin' her up
She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
Her status looks at us from down below
Now the bitch is in trouble
'Cause she was

So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
So-(Phisticated)
Little is known about her past
So listen to me 'cause I know her ass
Used to steal money out her boyfriend's clothes
And never got caught, so the story goes
She kept doin' that to all her men
Found the wrong man when she did it again
And still to this day people wonder why
Did he beat the bitch down til she almost died?
