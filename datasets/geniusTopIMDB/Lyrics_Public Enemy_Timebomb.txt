Timebomb Lyrics
Hey, Chuck, we got some non-believers out there…
Yo, we got to do somethin' about that, man…
Yo, we got to get stupid
Yo, we gotta let ‘em know what time it is

You go ooh and aah when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
No matter who you are, when I'm up to par
I betcha go hip hop, hurray or hurrah
But the aahs and oohs is my kind of news
Pop your tape in, put your car in cruise
I never heard the boos, I never drank booze
'Cause I just rock the rhythm, left alone the blues
The L.I. mystique, you sneak to peek
A look and then you know that we're never weak
I know you can't wait, it's never too late
No fear I'm here, and everything is straight
Cycles, cycles, life runs in cycles
New is old, no I'm not no psycho
The monkey on the back makes the best excel
The people in the crowd makes the rock well
The people in the back lets you know who's wack
And those who lack, the odds are stacked
The one who makes the money is white not black
You might not believe it but it is like that
When you come to my show, watch me throw
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
When you make a move, new not used
And watch the bro here just bust a groove
A fat lady soprano, loads my ammo
Hear my jam with a funky piano
Easy on the wall but hard on the panel
A fool smokes Kools 'cause he chokes on Camels
In effect, the crew's in check
Run by the posse with the gold around the neck
Homeboy's in heat, lookin' for sweet
Ladies in the crowd so they can meet
Somebody to body, makin' a baby
Givin' it to grandma then makin' her crazy
I'm a MC protector, U.S. defector
South African government wrecker
Panther power, you can feel it in my arm
Lookout y'all 'cause I'm a timebomb
Tickin', tockin', all about rockin'
Makin' much dollars while the crazy one's clockin'
The rhythm, to shake the house downy down
Bounce to the ounce, sound so crown
The man, the enemy, Public King, no thing
All fall to the force of my swing
Like Ali, Frazier, Thriller in Manila
Pinpoint, point blank, microphone killer
Am I, no need to lie, got the Flavor Flav
To prove I'll win and if not the save
I'll pick up, rack up, put your whole shack up
Just choose to lose the bet, emcee stick up
This is the wiz, but the mic's not his
It's mine, one time, let the star shine
And I'm tellin' you, yellin' at you, you're through
Don't think you're grown 'cause your mustache grew
I'm number one, you know it weighs a ton
And I'll be the burger, you can be the bun, girl
Surroundin', my steady poundin'
Get on down to my funky sound, and
Rock the rhythm rhyme, one time your mind
Rhythm roll, two-time control
The mauler and the caller of your doom
And when I'm ready to leave, you're gonna know I go boom
Three times y'all, rhythm rhyme and rock
Then you'll that the D is on the block
Four times y'all and never ever the wack
It's the hour to the minute, time to blow, blackYou might also like2Embed
