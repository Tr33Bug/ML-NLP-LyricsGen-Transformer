Who Stole the Soul? Lyrics
Once again, this is it
Turn it up, here we go
But this time the rhyme's
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then let's get down to the nitty-gritty
I wanna know who
Picked Wilson's pocket
After he rocked it
Fact, he shocked it
Same kinda thing they threw at James (Brown)
And what they did to Redd was a shame
The bigger the Blacks get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that ... booty
Intentional Rape System, like we ain't
Paid enough in this bitch, that's why I dissed them
I learned we earned, got no concern
Instead we burned, where the hell is our return?
Plain and simp, the system's a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho who stole the soul
Ain't, no, different than in South Africa
Over here they'll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo, they say the Black don't know how to act (Who, me?)
Cause we're waitin' for the big payback
But we know it'll never come
That's why I say come and get some
Why when the Black moves in, Jack moves out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Ain't we all people?
How the hell can a color be no good to a neighborhood
Help, straighten me out
Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
Sayin' I'm wrong for singin' a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
Try to be the best and...
Let everybody know before I blow
Cuz I wanna know what sucka stole the soul

We choose to use their ways
And holidays notice some of them are heller days
Invented by those that never repented
For the sins within that killed my kin
But that's all right
I try do what a brother does
But I'll never know if you're my cuz
That's why I try my best to unite
Damn the rest if they don't like it
Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
Has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble, Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him
40 acres and a mule Jack
Where is it why'd you try to fool the Black
It wasn't you, but you pledge allegiance
To the red, white, and blue
Suckers that stole the soul!You might also like1Embed
