A Kind of Magic Lyrics
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream, one soul
One prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
(It's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Is this a kind of magic?
(It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be done!
This is (this is) a kind (a kind)
Of magic (yeah)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done (done!)
