Bicycle Race Lyrics
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride it where I like

You say black, I say white
You say bark, I say bite
You say shark, I say, hey, man
Jaws was never my scene
And I don't like Star Wars
You say Rolls, I say Royce
You say God, Give me a choice!
You say Lord, I say, Christ!
I don't believe in Peter Pan
Frankenstein or Superman
All I wanna do is
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my bike
I want to ride my bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle races are coming your way
So forget all your duties, oh yeah
Fat bottomed girls
They'll be riding today
So look out for those beauties, oh yeah
On your marks! Get set! Go!
Bicycle race, bicycle race, bicycle race

Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle
I want to ride my
Bicycle, bicycle
Bicycle, bicycle
Bicycle, bicycle race
(I want a bicycle race)
