Cool Cat Lyrics
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah

Ah, you're taking all the sunshine away
And making out like you're the main line, I knew that

'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, ha-ahn
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh, you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh, you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh, messing with the beat of my heart, yeah

Ooh, you used to be a mean kid
Mm, making such a deal of life
Ooh, you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen?
No, you're speeding too fast
Slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down
Slow down

Ah, you really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove, yeah

Cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh, just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah
You might also like
Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah, yeah
Feeling the beat of my heart
Wooh-ooh
Feelin', feelin', feelin' it, honey
