Flashâ€™s Theme Lyrics
Flash! A-ah!
Savior of the Universe
Flash! A-ah!
He'll save every one of us

(Seemingly there is no reason for these extraordinary intergalactical upsets)
(Hahahahahahaha)
Dale: What's happening, Flash?
(Only Doctor Hans Zarkov, formerly at NASA, has provided any explanation)
Flash! A-ah!
He's a miracle

(This morning's unprecedented solar eclipse is no cause for alarm)

Flash! A-ah!
King of the impossible

He's for every one of us
Stand for every one of us
He saves with a mighty hand
Every man, every woman
Every child, it's the mighty flash

(General Kala, Flash Gordon approaching.)
General Kala: What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching? Open fire! All weapons! Dispatch war rocket Ajax to bring back his body

Flash! A-ah!
(Gordon's alive!)
You might also like
Flash! A-ah!
He'll save every one of us

Just a man with a man's courage
You know he's nothing but a man
And he can never fail
No one but the pure at heart
May find the Golden Grail
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Dale: Flash, Flash, I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!
