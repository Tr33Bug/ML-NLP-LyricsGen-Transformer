Friends Will Be Friends Lyrics
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are created
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash
And leaving you with the lumber

Got a pain in the chest
Doctor's on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
'Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered
A letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You try to track him down
But somebody stole his number

As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life
Without him in your way
It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust
You might also like
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end


It's so easy now
Cause you got friends you can trust

Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Cause right till the end
Friends will be friends, yeah7Embed
