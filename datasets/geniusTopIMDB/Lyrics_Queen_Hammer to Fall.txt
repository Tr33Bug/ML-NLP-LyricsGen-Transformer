Hammer to Fall Lyrics
Yeah!

Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light, yeah
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah
(You don't waste no time at all)
Don't hear the bell, but you answer the call
(It comes to you, as to us all)
Yeah, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall, yeah
Oh, every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles
As your body decays, yeah

(Tow your line and play their game)
Yeah, let the anaesthetic cover it all
(Till one day they call your name)
You know it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same
Yeah, baby (Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, baby, now your struggle is all in vain

For he who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder
And louder and louder
You might also like
(What the hell we fighting for?)
Oh, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
(Just got time to say your prayers)
Eh, while you're waiting
For the hammer to, hammer to fall

Hey, it'sâ€¦
It's gonna fall
Hammer, you know
Yeah, hammer to fall
Woo! Yeah, yeah
Woo, woo!
Ha, yeah, waiting
For the hammer to fall, now baby
Yeah, yeah
While you're waiting
For the hammer to fall, ooh
Give it to me one more time!14Embed
