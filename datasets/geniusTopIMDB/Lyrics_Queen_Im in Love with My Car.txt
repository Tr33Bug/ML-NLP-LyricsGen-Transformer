Iâ€™m in Love with My Car Lyrics
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a-pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh, it's like a disease, son
I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So, she made tracks
Saying, "This is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four-wheeled friends, now"

When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen
To no run-of-the-mill talk jive

I'm in love with my car (Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
Got to feel for my automobile (Ooh)
I'm in love with my car (Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
String back gloves
In my automolove (Ooh)You might also like5Embed
