Innuendo Lyrics
One, two, three, four
Ooh, ooh!

While the sun hangs in the sky
And the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea
And meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars
And the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying, yeah
Just passing our time
Ooh, ooh!

While we live according to race
Color or creed
While we rule by blind madness
And pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition
Superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on

Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time!

Through the sorrow
All through our splendor
Don't take offense at my innuendo
You might also like
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything
You think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free
Be free to yourself
Ooh, ooh, yeah!

If there's a God, or any kind
Of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason
To live or die
If there's an answer to the questions
We feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears
Release your mask

Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whatever will be, will be
(We'll just keep on trying)
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time!9Embed
