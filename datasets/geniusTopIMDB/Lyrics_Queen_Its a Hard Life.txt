Itâ€™s a Hard Life Lyrics
I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living
With a broken heart
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone
You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over
And I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long, hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

How it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)
When your love has cut
You down to size
Life is tough, on your own
Now I'm waiting for something
To fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love
You might also like
Yes, it's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long, hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Yeah!) It's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching
For love in every way
It's a long, hard fight (Hard fight!)
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself
And say I did it for love
Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh I did it for love15Embed
