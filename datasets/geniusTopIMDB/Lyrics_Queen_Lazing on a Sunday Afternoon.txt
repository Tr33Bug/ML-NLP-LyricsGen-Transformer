Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon Lyrics

I go off to work on Monday morning
Tuesday, I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for sunny-down
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday, I go waltzing to the Zoo
I come from London town
I'm just an ordinary guy
Fridays, I go painting in the Louvre

I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night (There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday, lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon
