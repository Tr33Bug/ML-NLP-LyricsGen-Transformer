TranslationsTürkçeEspañolРусскийLove of My Life Lyrics

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?

(Please bring it back, back) Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me (means to me)

You will remember when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)

Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me (means to me)
You might also like
Love of my life
Love of my life
