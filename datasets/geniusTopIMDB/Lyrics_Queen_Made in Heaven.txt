Made in Heaven Lyrics
I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see?
That's what everybody says to me
Can't you see?
Oh I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes, it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart

I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It's for all to see
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really meant to be
Oh, can't you see?
Yeah, everybody, everybody says
Yes, it was meant to be, yeah

When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies
Break through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever
You might also like
Made in heaven
I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving in all my soul

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Wait and see, it was really meant to be
So plain to see
Yeah, everybody, everybody
Everybody tells me so
Yes, it was plain to see
Yes, it was meant to be

Written in the stars
Written in the stars
