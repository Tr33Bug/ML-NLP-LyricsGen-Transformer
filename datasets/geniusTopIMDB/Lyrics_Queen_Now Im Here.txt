Now Iâ€™m Here Lyrics
Here I stand
Look around, around
Around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a, just a new man
Yes, you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared
Didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight
Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry, baby
I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so?
Ooh, don't I love him so?
You might also like

Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around (think I'll stay around, around)
Around, around, around, around (around, around, around, around)
Down in the city just as you and me (down in the city just as you and me)
Don't I love you so

Go, go, go, little queenie!4Embed
