Seven Seas of Rhye Lyrics

Fear me you Lords
And lady preachers
I descend upon your earth
From the skies
I command your very souls
You unbelievers

Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Can you hear me you peers
And privy counselors?
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man
Who dares abuse my trust

I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Sister, I live and lie for you
Mister, do and I'll die
You are mine, I possess you
I belong to you forever (Ever, ever)


Storm the master-marathon
Iâ€™ll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire
And I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature (I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive)
And come out alive, then I'll get you
Be gone with you
You shod and shady senators
Give out the good
Leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan
And his troubadours
You might also like
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
I do like to stroll upon the Prom, Prom, Prom!
Where the brass band plays: "tiddely-om-pom-pom!"
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
When I'm down beside the sea, I'm beside meself with glee
Beside the seaside! Beside the sea18Embed
