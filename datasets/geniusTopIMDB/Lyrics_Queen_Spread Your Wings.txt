Spread Your Wings Lyrics
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
"Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping
Up the Emerald Bar"
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings
Alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world
Nothing would make him stay

Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him
"Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition
You won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy
At the Emerald Bar?"

So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Come on, honey
Fly with me14Embed
