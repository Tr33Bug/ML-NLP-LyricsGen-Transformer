Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together) Lyrics
When I'm gone
No need to wonder
If I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us
And time is but a paper moon
Be not gone

Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold
The flower that touches you
A new life grows, the blossom knows
There's no one else
Could warm my heart as much as you
Be not gone
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned

手を取り合ってこのまま行こう
愛する人よ
静かな宵に
光を灯し
愛しき教えを抱き
Hear my song
Still, think of me the way
You've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes
And you can be with me
Dream on

手を取り合ってこのまま行こう
愛する人よ
静かな宵に
光を灯し
愛しき教えを抱き
You might also like
When I'm gone
They'll say we're all fools
And we don't understand
Oh, be strong
Don't turn your heart
We're all, you're all
For all, for always

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned
