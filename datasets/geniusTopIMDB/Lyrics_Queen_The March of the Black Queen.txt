The March of the Black Queen Lyrics
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Do you mean it?
Why don't you mean it?
Why do I follow you
And where do you go?


You've never seen nothing like it, no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it (and the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen, poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that, bring them down to size
(March to the Black Queen)


Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little niggah sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil

Black on, black on
Every finger nail and toe, we've only begun, begun
Make this, make that, keep making all that noise
(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)

Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-chile, yes

You might also like

A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
(A little bit of love and joy)
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
(A little bit of love and joy)
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even 'till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

I reign with my left hand, I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness, I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me, I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the black Queen
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the black Queen, tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her i's
(She's our leader)


Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
(La la la la forever) forever
Ah ah ah ah ah
