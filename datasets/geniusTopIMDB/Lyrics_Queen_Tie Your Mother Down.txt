Tie Your Mother Down Lyrics
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating, baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
"You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact
I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night

Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother
Swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine
You might also like
Bad guy

Your mommy and your daddy
Are gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it
I'm just a peace loving guy
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big, big, big, big, big
Big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down
Yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

Give me every inch of your love
Gotta get my timing right
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
