TranslationsPortuguêsWe Are the Champions Lyrics
I've paid my dues, time after time
I've done my sentence, but committed no crime
And bad mistakes I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face, but I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause, we are the champions of the world
I've taken my bows and my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause, we are the champions of the world
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause, we are the champions…You might also like52Embed
