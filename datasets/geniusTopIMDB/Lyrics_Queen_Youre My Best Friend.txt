Youâ€™re My Best Friend Lyrics

Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
Been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
(Ooh) Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering round (Round)
But still come back to you
(Ooh, still come back to you)
In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl (Girl)
I'm happy at home
(I'm happy, happy at home)
You're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

Oh, you're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Oh, you're my best friend (Oh)
You might also like
Ooh, you make me live
(Live, live, live)
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Oh, you're my best friend

Ooh, you make me live, ooh
Ooh, you're my best friend25Embed
