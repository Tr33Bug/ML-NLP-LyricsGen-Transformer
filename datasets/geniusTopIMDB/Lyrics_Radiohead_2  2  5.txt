2 + 2 = 5 Lyrics
We're on, that's a nice way to start, Jonny

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because

You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention

I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not, 'cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies
But like flies, the bugs keep coming back
Not, but I'm not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But I'm not, but I'm not
But I'm not, but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in a box
'Cause I'm not, cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king
That the sky is falling in
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not
Maybe not, maybe not27Embed
