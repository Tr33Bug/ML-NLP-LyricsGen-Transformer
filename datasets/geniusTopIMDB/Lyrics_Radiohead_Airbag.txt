TranslationsTürkçeAirbag Lyrics
In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe


In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
