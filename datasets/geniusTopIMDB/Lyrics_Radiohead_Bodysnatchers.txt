Bodysnatchers Lyrics
I do not understand
What it is I've done wrong
Full of holes, check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes, two for no

I've no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
You killed the sound, removed backbone
A pale imitation with the edges all sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your arse

Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the twenty-first century
It is the twenty-first century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
All the lines wrapped 'round my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm a lie

I've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it coming
They've seen it comingYou might also like18Embed
