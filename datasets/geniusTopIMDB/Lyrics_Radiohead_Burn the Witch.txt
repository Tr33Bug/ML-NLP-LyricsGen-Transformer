Burn the Witch Lyrics
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up
This is a low-flying panic attack

Sing the song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low-flying panic attack

Sing the song of sixpence that goes

Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you liveYou might also like74Embed
