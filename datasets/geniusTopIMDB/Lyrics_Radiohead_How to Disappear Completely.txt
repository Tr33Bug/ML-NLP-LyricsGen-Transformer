How to Disappear Completely Lyrics
That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

Strobe lights
And blown speakers
Fireworks
And hurricanes

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ahh
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ahh-ah
