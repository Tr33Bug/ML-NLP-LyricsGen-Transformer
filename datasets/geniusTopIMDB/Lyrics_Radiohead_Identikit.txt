Identikit Lyrics
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be
Oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be
Oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be
Oh, me
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all

But now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know

Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain, broken hearts make it rain

The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create

But when I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know35Embed
