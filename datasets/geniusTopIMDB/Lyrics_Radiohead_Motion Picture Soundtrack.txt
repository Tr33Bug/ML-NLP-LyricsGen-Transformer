Motion Picture Soundtrack Lyrics
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy
Maybe, I think you're crazy
Maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy
Maybe, I think you're crazy
Maybe

I will see you in the next lifeYou might also like40Embed
