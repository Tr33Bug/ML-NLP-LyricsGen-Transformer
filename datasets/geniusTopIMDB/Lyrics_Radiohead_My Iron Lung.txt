My Iron Lung Lyrics
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, we'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

And if you're frightened, you can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
And if you're frightened, you can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
You might also like

The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon31Embed
