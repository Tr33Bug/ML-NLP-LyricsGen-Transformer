Reckoner Lyrics
Reckoner
Can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name

Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate (In rainbows)
Like ripples on a blank shore (In rainbows)

Reckoner
Take me with you

Dedicated to all hu–
All human beingsYou might also like39Embed
