The Numbers Lyrics
It holds us like a phantom
It touches  like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See, the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
'Cause we're not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mm-hmm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
(One day at a time)
One day at a time

We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers don't decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours

One day at a timeYou might also like21Embed
