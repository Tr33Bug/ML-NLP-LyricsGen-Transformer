Videotape Lyrics
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
And you are my centre when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape...
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day I've ever seenYou might also like60Embed
