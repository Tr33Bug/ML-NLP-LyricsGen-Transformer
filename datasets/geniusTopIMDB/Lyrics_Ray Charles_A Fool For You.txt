A Fool For You Lyrics
I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you didn't want me
You didn't love me no more
I want to know

Oh, what makes me be
Do you believe me child
A fool for you
Oh no, I'm a fool for you
I know you told me
You didn't want me around
And I know
You got a man way across town
So I know it's something


Did you ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Reach over and feel the pillow
Where your baby used to lay
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before, oh Lord
Yeah you even cry so loud
You give the blues to your neighbor next door
Ever since you were five years old
I been a fool for you, little girl
Way down in my soul
I'm a little fool for you
So I know it's something
Oh, oh, Lord
I'm a fool for youYou might also likeEmbed
