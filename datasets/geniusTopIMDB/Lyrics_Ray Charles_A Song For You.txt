A Song For You Lyrics
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages, with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling, can't you please see through me
Because we're alone now and I'm singing my song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholding nothing
But you came out in front and I was hiding, yeah
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, because you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you
Yes, we were alone and I was singing this song for you, baby
We were alone and I was singing my song
Singing my song
Singing my song
Singing my song
