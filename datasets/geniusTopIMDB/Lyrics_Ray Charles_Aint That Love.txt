Ainâ€™t That Love Lyrics
Now, baby when you sigh
(When you sigh)
I want to sigh with you
When you cry
(When you cry)
I want to cry some, too

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love that I feel
(That I feel)
In my heart for you
When your friends
(When your friends)
Turn their back on you
I'll be here
(I'll be here)
Just to see you through


Now when you walk
(When you walk)
I want to walk with you
When you talk
(When you talk)
Want to talk some, too


If you ever
(If you ever)
Ever need a friend
I'll be with you
(Be with you)
Yes, until the end
You might also like

Baby, won't you let me hold your hand
I want to squeeze you as tight as I can
Baby, don't you need me by your side
To protect you and be your guide
Baby, I'm so in love with you
I'd do anything you tell me to


Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh!Embed
