Am I Blue Lyrics
Am I blue? Am I blue?
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you?

Am I blue? You'll be too
If your schemes, like your dreams, done fell through

Was a time I was her only one
Now I am the sad and lonely one
Oh yes I am
Was I gay? Till today
Now she's gone and we're through
Am I blue?

Was a time I was her only one
Now I am the sad and lonely one
I'm such a lonely one

Was I gay? Till today
Now she's gone and we're through
