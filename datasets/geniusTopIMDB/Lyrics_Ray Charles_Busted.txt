Busted Lyrics
Yeah, my bills are all due and the baby needs shoes but I'm busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound but I'm busted right now
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day
The county's gonna haul my belongings away 'cause I'm busted right now
Oh, yes I am

Well, I went to my brother to ask for a loan 'cause I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog without a bone but I'm busted, I tell ya
My brother said, "There ain't a thing I can do
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking about calling on you 'cause I'm busted myself"
Well, that's what he told me
Yeah, I am no thief but a man can go wrong when he's busted
The food that we canned the last summer is gone and I'm busted right now
Well, the fields all are bare and the cotton won't grow
Me and my family got to pack up and go
I'll make a living, where, I don't know 'cause I'm busted today

Y'all know I'm broke
I ain't got no money
I'm talkin' 'bout empty pockets
Ah, forget it
Ah, to hell with it
