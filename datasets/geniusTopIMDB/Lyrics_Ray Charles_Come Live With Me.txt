Come Live With Me Lyrics
Come live with me and won't you be my love?
Share my bread and wine
Be wife to me
Be life to me
Be mine

Come live with me and won't you be my love
Let our dreams combine
Be great to me
Be fate to me
Be mine
Oh, with these hands
I'll build a roof to shield your head
Oh, with these hands
I'll carve the wood for our baby's bed

Yes, come live with me and won't you be my love
So I can love you all the time
Be part of me
Girl, be the heart of me
Be mine

Ooh, I'll try to do my best for you, I swear, I promise you, girl
Girl, didn't I tell you, I'm gonna lie for you
Oh, you know, girl, I'll cry for you
I say my whole life through

Oh, oh, come live with me and won't you be my love?
Hey, hey, share my bread and wine
Be part of me
Said, oh, be the heart of me, baby
Please be mineYou might also likeEmbed
