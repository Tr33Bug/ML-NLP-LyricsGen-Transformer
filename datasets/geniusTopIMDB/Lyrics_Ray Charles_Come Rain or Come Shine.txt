Come Rain or Come Shine Lyrics
I'm gonna love you like no one's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true, well, if you let me
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And wouldn't it be fine?

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or are we out of the money?
Yeah, but I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And wouldn't it be fine?

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or are we out of the money?
Yeah, but I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shineYou might also like1Embed
