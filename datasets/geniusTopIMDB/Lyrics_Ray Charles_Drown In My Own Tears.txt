Drown In My Own Tears Lyrics
It brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin to realize
I've cried so much since you've been gone
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears
I sit and cry just like a child
My pouring tears are running wild
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown, oh yeah, in my own tears
I know it's true into each life
Oh some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue here without you
It keeps raining more and more
Why don't you come on home?
Oh yes, so I won't be all alone
If you don't think you'll be home soon
I guess I'll (drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby
(Drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(Drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh, mmmmmYou might also like1Embed
