Georgia On My Mind Lyrics
Georgia
Georgia
The whole day through
(The whole day through)
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
(Georgia on my mind)

I said a-Georgia
Georgia
A song of you
(A song of you)
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms a-reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still, in the peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

I said, Georgia, oh, Georgia
No peace I find (No peace I find)
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
(Georgia on my mind, oh)

Other arms a-reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still, in peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

Oh, oh
Georgia
Georgia
No peace, no peace I find
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
(Georgia on my mind)

I said, just an old, sweet song
