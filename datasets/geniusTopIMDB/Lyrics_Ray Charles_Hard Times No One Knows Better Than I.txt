Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I) Lyrics
My mother told me before she passed away
Said, "Son, when I'm gone don't forget to pray

Because there'll be hard times, hard times, oh yeah yeah
Who knows better than I?"

Well, I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay my rent
Talking about hard times, hard times, oh yeah yeah
Who knows, oh well, better than I?


I had a woman, Lord, who was always around
But when I lost my money, then she put me down

Talking about hard times, you know those hard
Yeah, Lord, who knows better than I?

Yeah, Lord, yeah, one of these days
There'll be no more sorrow when I pass away
And no more hard times, I say, "No more hard"
Yeah, Lord, who knows, yeah, Lord, better than I?You might also likeEmbed
