I Believe To My Soul Lyrics
One of these days and it won't be long
You're going to look for me and I'll be gone

Now you know I believe
(I believe, yes, I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
Well, I believe to my soul now
You're trying to make a fool of me
(I believe it, I believe it)
Well, you're going around here with your head so hard
I think I'm gonna have to use my rod

'Cause I believe
(I believe, yes, I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
Well, I believe to my soul now
You're trying to make a fool of me now
(I believe it, I believe it)

Last night you were dreaming, and I heard you say
(Oh, Johnny!) When you know my name is Ray

That's why I believe it now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
I say I believe right now
(I believe, yes, I believe)
Whoa-oh, I believe to my soul now
You're trying to make a fool of me now
(I believe it)You might also like2Embed
