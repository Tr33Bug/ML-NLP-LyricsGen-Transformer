I Donâ€™t Need No Doctor Lyrics
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, no no
'Cause I know what's ailing me

I've been too long away from my baby, ah
I'm coming down with a misery

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor, I tell you now
For my prescription to be filled

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

Only my baby's arms
Could ever take away this chill

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

Now the doctor say I need rest (Hey, hey)
Before I need her tenderness
Put me on the critical list (Hey, hey)
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe (It didn't soothe)
My emotion
You might also like
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

I don't need no doctor, no no
For my hope to live is gone

I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

All I need is my baby
Baby, please
Won't you please come on home

I don't need no doctor (You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no Aspirins (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion (I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need (I don't need no doctor)
No vitamin pills (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need (I don't need no doctor)
Yeah, no babysitter (I don't need no doctor)

All I need (I don't need no doctor)
All I need (I don't need no doctor)
Yeah, my baby child (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no surgery (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no implants (I don't need no doctor)Embed
