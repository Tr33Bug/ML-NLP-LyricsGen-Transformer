Iâ€™ve Got a Woman Lyrics
Well

I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Say I got a woman, way over town
Good to me, oh yeah
She give me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
She saves her lovin', early in the mornin'
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her lovin', early in the mornin'
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her lovin', just for me
Aah, she love me, so tenderly
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah


She's there to love me
Both day and night
Never grumbles or fusses
Always treats me right
Never runnin' in the streets
And leavin' me alone
She knows a woman's place
Is right there, now, in her home

I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Say I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Oh she's my baby, oh don't you understand
Yeah, and I'm her lover man
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
