Letâ€™s Go Get Stoned Lyrics(Let's go get stoned, oh oh oh) Yeah
(Let's go get stoned)
(Let's go get stoned, oh oh oh) Everybody
(Let's go get stoned) Now wait a minute
You know my baby, she won't let me in
I got a few pennies, I'm gonna buy myself a bottle of gin
And then I'm gonna call my buddy on the telephone and say
(Let's go get stoned) Now listen
You know I work so hard all day long
Everything I try to do seem to always turn out wrong
That's why I wanna stop by on my way home and say
(Let's go get stoned) Now let me tell you one more thing
Ain't no harm to have a little a taste
But don't lose your cool and start messing up the man's place
Ain't no harm take a little nip
But don't you fall down and bust your lip, no no
(Let's go get stoned, oh oh oh) Now now
(Let's go get stoned)
I think everyone should come on and go with me
(Let's go get stoned, oh oh oh)
(Let's go get stoned)
I'm gonna tell you one more time, that's what I'm gonna do
(Let's go get stoned, oh oh oh) Now now
(Let's go get stoned) I think you ought to say it one more time
