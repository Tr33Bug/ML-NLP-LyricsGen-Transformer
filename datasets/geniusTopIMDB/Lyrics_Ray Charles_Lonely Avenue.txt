Lonely Avenue Lyrics
Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby, with you
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
(Lonely avenue) Yes sir

Now my covers, they feel like lead
And my pillow, it feels like stone
Well, I've tossed and turned so every night
I'm not used to being alone
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Yes sir (lonely avenue)
Lonely avenue
Lonely avenue
You might also like
Now I've been so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child, I would be highway bound
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die) Oh ooh, yeah
I live on a lonely avenue
