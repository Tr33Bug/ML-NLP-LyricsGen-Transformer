Makinâ€™ Whoopee! Lyrics
Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
To make whoopee
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, uhh, he answers twice
It's really killing, the boy's so willing
To make whoopee, whoopee
Picture a little love nest, yeah
Down where the roses cling
Picture that same sweet love nest
See what a year can bring
I tell you the boy's washing dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, ooh, I tell you he sews
It's really killing, the boy's so willing
To make whoopee, whoopee
Another year, maybe less
What's this I hear, well can't you guess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of making Whoopee
She sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone he doesn't write
He says he's busy, and she says is he?
He's making whoopee
You see, I don't make much money
Only five, uh-uh, thousand per
And some judge who thinks he's funny
Tells me I got to pay six to her
I said now judge, suppose I fail?
The judge says, "ray, son, son, right on into jail
Ah, you better keep her. I think it's cheaper."
 You know what I've been doing, don't you?You might also like1Embed
