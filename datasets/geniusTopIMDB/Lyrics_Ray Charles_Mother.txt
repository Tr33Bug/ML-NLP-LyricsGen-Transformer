Mother Lyrics
And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesn't matter how old that i grow
Mother's love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mother's love away
Mama could be strong but you knew that she loved you
She taught me how to walk and talk and pray
Since she's gone on a heaven
All those memories of those days
And i think of the things that i didn't get a chance to say

And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesn't matter how old that i grow
Mother's love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mother's love away

Always there the first thing the morning
Making sure that i got up for school
Get yourself ready to go
She said go to class and learn some more
And remember that there's no one in the word better than you
That's why i miss my mother
You might also like

There ain't no blues that have been written
That could make me feel this way
I lost the one that was there for me all my life
The day the Lord took mama far away
