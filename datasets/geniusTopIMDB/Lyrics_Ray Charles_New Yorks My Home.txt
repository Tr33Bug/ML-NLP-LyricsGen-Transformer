New Yorkâ€™s My Home Lyrics
There's a rumour going around
That some of you good people
Want to leave this town

But you better consult me before you go
Cause I've been in all these places
And I know
Chicago's all right
It's got the Wrigley Field and
Soldier's Field and Marshall Field
And it's on a nice lake
But it hasn't got
The hansoms in the park
It hasn't got a skyline after dark
That's why New York's my home
Never let me leave it
New York's my home, sweet home

What about Hollywood
Hollywood's got movie stars and
Movie czars and cocktail bars and
Shiny cars and a wonderful climate, they say

But it hasn't got
The handy subway train
You seldom find a taxi
When it rains
That's why New York's my home
Keep your California
New York's my home, sweet home

Geez, what's happening in St.Louis
Lots of people like St.Louis
It's got lots of shoes
And the St.Louis blues and
One of our larger rivers runs by
You might also like
But it hasn't got the opera in The Met
It hasn't got a famous string quartet
That's why New York's my home
No, not a place to visit
New York's my home, sweet home

San Francisco 
Is a lovely place
It's got lots of hills
And lots of thrills and it's
On an ocean of some size

But it hasn't got
The Bowery or The Bronx
It hasn't got the Harlem honkytonks
That's why New York's my home
Yeah, it's my favorite city
New York's my home, sweet home

So, save your time and trouble
I say save your railroad fare
I said save your time and trouble, brother
Save your railroad fare
Cause when you leave New York
Let me say, you ain't going nowhereEmbed
