Ruby Lyrics
They say, Ruby, you're like a dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so, I only know

Ruby, it's you

They say, Ruby, you're like a song
You just don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heartaches for me
Right from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you (Must come to you)
I have no choice, so what else can I do? (What else can I do?)
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware, still I just don't care
You thrill me so, I only know

Ruby, it's you
(I hear your voice and I must come to you)
(I have no choice, what else can I do? What can I do?)
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware, still I don't care
You thrill me so, I only know
Ruby, it's youYou might also likeEmbed
