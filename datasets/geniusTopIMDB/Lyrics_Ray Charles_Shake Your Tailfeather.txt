Shake Your Tailfeather Lyrics
Well i heard about the fellow you've been dancing with
All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me baby
Or didn't you think i could?
Well i know that the boogaloo is out of sight
But the shingaling's the thing tonight
But if that was you and me a now baby
I would have shown you how to do it right
Do it right (u-huh)
Do it right (do it right)
Dot it right
Do it right
Do it right
Aaah
Twisting, shake it shake it shake it shake it baby
Hey we gonna loop de loop
Shake it out baby
Hey we gonna loop de la
Bend over let me see ya shake your tailfeather
Bend over let me see ya shake your tailfeather
Come on let me see ya shake your tailfeather
Come on let me see ya shake your tailfeather
Aaah 

Come on, come on baby
Come on, yeah, come on babe, alright
Do the twist
Do the fly
Do the swim
And do the bird
Well do the duck
Aaah, and do the monkey
Hey hey, watusi
And a what about the food
Do the mashed potato
What about the boogaloo
Oh, the bony marony
Come on let's do the twist
Aaah
