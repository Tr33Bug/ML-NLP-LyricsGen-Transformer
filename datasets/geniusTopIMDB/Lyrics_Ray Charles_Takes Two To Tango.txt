Takes Two To Tango Lyrics
You can haunt any house by yourself
Be a man or a mouse by yourself
You can act like a king on a throne
There are lots of things that you can do alone

But it takes two to tango, two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
It takes two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love
You can sail on a ship by yourself
Take a nap or nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own
There are lots of things that you can do alone

I say two to tango, it takes two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
It takes two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love

You can get very old by yourself
Catch a fish or a cold by yourself
Dig a ditch, strike it rich all by yourself
There are lots of things that you can do alone

But it takes two to tango, two to tango
To really get the feeling of romance
Two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love

You can fight like a champ by yourself
You can lick any stamp by yourself
You can be very brave on the phone
There's lots of things that you can do alone
You might also like
I say, it takes two to tango, it takes two to tango
Two to really get the feeling of romance
It takes two to tango, two to tango
Do the dance of love

It takes two, i say two
Darling it always takes two
I'm with youEmbed
