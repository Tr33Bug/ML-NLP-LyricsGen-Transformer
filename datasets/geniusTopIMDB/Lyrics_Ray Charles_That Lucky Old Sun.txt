That Lucky Old Sun Lyrics
Up in the morning, out on the job
I work like the devil for my pay

I know that a lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
(Roll around heaven all day)

I fuss with my woman, and I toil with my kids
I sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
I know that lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

Dear Lord above, don't you see I'm pining?
I got tears all in my eyes
Why don't You send down that cloud
With the, the silver lining?
Lift me up to paradise
(Lift me up to paradise)

Show me that river, why don't You take me across
And wash all my troubles away?

I know that lucky old sun now, he's got nothing to do
Huh, but just roll around heaven all day

Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining?
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with the silver lining
Lift me to paradise
(Lift me up to paradise)
You might also like
Oh, show me that river and take me across
Wash all my troubles away

And I know the lucky old sun now, he's got nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day, yes, sir

He's got nothing but roll around heaven all day
I say he just roll around heaven all day
Now you say it (Roll around heaven all day)
Yes, LordEmbed
