That Spirit of Christmas Lyrics
Christmas is that time of year
For being with the ones we love
Sharing so much joy and cheer
What a wonderful feelin'
Watching the ones we love
Having so much fun
I was sittin' by the fire side
Taking a walk through the snow
Listening to a children's choir
Singing songs about Jesus
The blessed way that he came to us
Why can't it remain
All through the year
Each day the same
Ah, that's what I wanna hear
Heh heh, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas

All the kinfolk gather 'round
The lovely Christmas tree
Hearts are glowing full of joy
Sense the gifts that we're giving
And the love that we're living

Why can't it remain (Why can't it remain?)
Oh, all through the year (All through the year)
Each day the same (Each day the same)
Ah, that's what I wanna hear
I'll tell ya, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas
Let me hear ya
(Why can't it remain?) Why can't it remain?
(All through the year) All through the year
(Each day the same) Each day the same
That's what I wanna hear
Listen to me, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas
You might also like
Oh, it's truly amazin'
That spirit of Christmas
Ain't it so? It's truly amazin'
Yeah, that spirit of Christmas
Oh, Christmas
Oh, ChristmasEmbed
