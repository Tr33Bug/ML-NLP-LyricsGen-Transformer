Unchain My Heart Lyrics
Unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
Baby, let me be (Unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
'Cause you don't care about me (Unchain my heart)
You've got me sewed up like a pillowcase
But you let my love go to waste
So unchain my heart, oh, please, please set me free
Unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
Baby, let me go (Unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
'Cause you don't love me no more (Unchain my heart)
Every time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home
So unchain my heart, oh, please, please set me free
I'm under your spell (I'm under your spell)
Like a man in a trance (Like a man in a trance)
But I know darn well (But I know darn well)
That I don't stand a chance (That I don't stand a chance)
So unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
Let me go my way (Unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
You worry me night and day (Unchain my heart)
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me?
So unchain my heart, oh, please, please set me free

I'm under your spell (I'm under your spell)
Like a man in a trance (Like a man in a trance)
I know darn well (But I know darn well)
That I don't stand a chance (That I don't stand a chance)
So unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
Let me go my way (Unchain my heart)
Unchain my heart (Unchain my heart)
You worry me night and day (Unchain my heart)
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me?
So unchain my heart, oh, please, please set me free

Oh, won't you set me free?
