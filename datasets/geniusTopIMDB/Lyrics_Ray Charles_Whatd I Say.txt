Whatâ€™d I Say Lyrics
Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
Alright now, hey hey, alright
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
Alright now now now, hey hey, hey hey
Tell your mama, tell your pa
I'm gonna send you back to Arkansas
Oh yes, ma'am, you don't do right, don't do right
When you see me in misery
Come on, baby, see about me
Now yeah, alright, alright, ah, play it, boy


When you see me in misery
Come on, baby, see about me
Now yeah, hey hey, alright

See the girl with the red dress on
She can do the Birdland all night long
Yeah yeah, what'd I say, alright

Well, tell me what'd I say, yeah
