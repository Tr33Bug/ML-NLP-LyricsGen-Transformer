You Are My Sunshine Lyrics
The other night
As I lay sleeping
Oh, I dreamed I held you
Held you in my arms
Woah, but when I woke up this morning
I found out I was mistaken
Do you know that I hung my
I hung my head and cried

Woah, you are my sunshine (You are my sunshine)
Oh, my only sunshine (My only sunshine)
Woah, little girl you make me happy sometimes (You make me happy)
When my skies are grey (When skies are grey)
Mhm, you'll never never, never, never know, dear (You'll never know, dear)
How much I love you (How much I love you)
But I don't want you to take (Don't take my sunshine)
My sunshine away ('Shine away)
You told me once, dear
That you really loved me
And no one else
Could ever come between, yeah
But now you left me
And you love another, yeah
And you have shattered, oh, yeah
All of my dreams

Woah, you are my sunshine (You are my sunshine)
Oh, my only sunshine (My only sunshine)
Oh, you make me happy sometimes (You make me happy)
When the skies are grey (When skies are grey)
Woah, you'll never never, never, never know, dear (You'll never know, dear)
How much I love you (How much I love you)
Woah, I don't want you to take (Don't take my sunshine)
Woah, if you love me (Don't take my sunshine)
Mhm, if you need me (Don't take my sunshine)
Uh-huh, if you want me (Don't take my sunshine)
Woah, yes, sir (Don't take my sunshine)
I don't want you to take (Don't take my sunshine)
Oh, oh, yes, sir, listen (Don't take my sunshine)
I don't want you to take (Don't take my sunshine)
Woah, my sunshine away ('Shine away)You might also like1Embed
