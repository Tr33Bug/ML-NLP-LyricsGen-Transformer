Blondes (Have More Fun) Lyrics
Is it a matter of opinion
Or just a contradiction
But from where I come from
All the blondes have more fun
Well just awatch them sisters on a Saturday night
Peroxide causin' all the fights

I took a rose in Texas
She gimme plenty of practice
But I couldn't touch the surface
'Cause of recent facelift
She had no idea what love's about
'Cept the one o'clock call on the casting couch
Sissy from New York
Was on the cover of New Vogue
I ain't supposed to be available
So completely untouchable
I got a limousine 'n' bodyguard and chaperone
But God knows Rodder just needs to ball

You can keep your black and your redheads
You can keep your brunettes too
I wanna girl that's semi intelligent
Gimme a blonde that's six feet two boy
And that ain't all


I had a crush on Bardot
Fell in love with Monroe
Read about 'em in the nationals
All the juicy little scandals
But I never saw 'em dancin' at the county hall
With the short fat guy's prematurely bald
Dig this
You might also like
You can keep your black and your redheads
You can keep your brunettes too
Don't wanna subservient woman
Gimme a blonde that's six feet two boy
And that ain't all
