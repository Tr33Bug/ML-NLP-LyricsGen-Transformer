Broken Arrow Lyrics
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Can we make it so that's part of the deal
I've gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line, this time
I wanna breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that, hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didn't you show me a sign this time
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
Can you see what I see
Can you cut behind the mystery
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind
I wanna come when you call
I'll get to you if I have to crawl
They can't hold me with these iron walls
We got mountains to climb, to climb

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world aroundYou might also likeEmbed
