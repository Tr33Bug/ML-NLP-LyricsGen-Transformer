Bye Bye Blackbird LyricsBlackbird, blackbird singing the blues all day
Right outside of my door
Blackbird, blackbird gotta be on my way
Where there's sunshine galore
Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye bye blackbird
No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye, yeah yeah
Bluebird, bluebird calling me far away
I've been waiting for you
Bluebird, bluebird, this is my lucky day
Now my dreams will come true
So pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye bye blackbird
No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
So make my bed and light the light
I will come late tonight
Blackbird, bye bye
Blackbird, bye bye
