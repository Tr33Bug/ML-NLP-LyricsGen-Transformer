Da Ya Think Iâ€™m Sexy? (Remix) Lyrics
Oh
Nah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She sits alone, waitin' for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoidin' all the questions
His lips are dry, his heart is gently poundin'
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?
His heart's beatin' like a drum (Like a drum)
Is he gonna get this girl home?
Real soon, baby, we'll be all alone
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, tell me so, ooh
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, ooh (Alright)

He's actin' shy, lookin' for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last, he can tell exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, tell me so, ooh (Tell me so)
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, ooh

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
I like this, I like this, I like this

Come on, baby, spend the night
I promise to behave myself
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
You might also like
His heart's beatin' like a drum (Like a drum)
Is he gonna get this girl home? (Is he?)
Real soon, baby, we'll be alone
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, tell me so, ooh
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, ooh (Uh, tell me so)

If you really, really, really need me
Just let me know, just let me know (If you really need me)
If you really, really, really need me
Just let me know, just let me know (Ah, yeah, yeah)Embed
