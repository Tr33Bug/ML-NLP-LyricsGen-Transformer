Da Ya Think Iâ€™m Sexy? Lyrics
Sugar, sugar
Ooh

She sits alone, waitin' for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoidin' all the questions
His lips are dry, his heart is gently poundin'
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar, let me know, ooh
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, ooh (Tell me so, baby)
He's actin' shy, lookin' for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last, he can tell exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on honey, tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know, oh

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar, let me know, ooh
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so, ooh (Tell me so, baby)

His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax, baby, now we are all alone, oh

You might also like
They wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, "I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie"

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on honey, tell me so


If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me
If you really want me
Just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar, let me know
If you, if you, if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so7Embed
