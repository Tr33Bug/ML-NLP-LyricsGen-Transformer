Every Beat of My Heart Lyrics
Through these misty eyes, I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family and my country?
Heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight, here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train in the pouring rain
Say farewell but don't say goodbye
Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine just for Auld Lang Syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now in my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast to the blood red rose
Cheer a while the Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights and the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry
You might also like
Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going homeEmbed
