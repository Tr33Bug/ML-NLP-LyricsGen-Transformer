Faith of the Heart Lyrics
It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near

And I can feel the change in the wind right now
Nothing's in my way
And they're not gonna hold me down no more
No, they're not gonna hold me down
'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm goin' where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anythin'
I've got strength of the soul
No one's going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith (I've got faith)
Faith of the heart

It's been a long night
Tryin' to find my way
Been through the darkness
Now I finally have my day

And I will see my dream come alive at last
I will touch the sky
And they're not gonna hold me down no more
No, they're not gonna change my mind

'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm goin' where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anythin'
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith (I've got faith)
Faith of the heart
You might also like
I know the wind's so cold
I've seen the darkest days
But now the winds I feel
Are only winds of change
I've been through the fire
And I've been through the rain
But I'll be fine

'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm goin' where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anythin'
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
(I've got, I've got)
I've got faith
Faith of the heart
I'm goin' where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
And no one's going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
'Cause I've got faith
'Cause I've got faith
Faith of the heart
It's been a long roadEmbed
