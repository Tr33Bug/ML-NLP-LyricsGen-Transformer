Gasoline Alley Lyrics
I think I know now what's making me sad
It's a yearnin' for my own back yard
I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride

Going home, running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home, and I'm running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born
When the weather's better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind don't whistle 'round my knees
I'll put on my weddin' suit and catch the evening train
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door

Going home, running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home, and I'm running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born


But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in my alley if I could
And if I'm called away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'll be asking of you
Don't bury me here, it's too cold

Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, won't you carry me home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back, carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
