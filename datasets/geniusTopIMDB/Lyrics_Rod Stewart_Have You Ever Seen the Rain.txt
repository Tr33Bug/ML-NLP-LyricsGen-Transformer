Have You Ever Seen the Rain LyricsSomeone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know;
It's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know;
Shinin' down like water
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?
Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know;
Been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know;
It can't stop, I wonder
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?
Yeah!
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?You might also like2Embed
