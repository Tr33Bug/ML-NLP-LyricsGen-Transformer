Hot Legs LyricsWho's that knocking on my door?
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again coming 'round for more?
Well you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talkin' to you
Hot legs
Wearing me out
Hot legs
You can scream and shout
Hot legs
Are you still in school?
I love you honey
Got a most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand
I'm a working man
Gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talking to you
Hot legs
You're an alley cat
Hot legs
You scratch my back
Hot legs
Bring your mother too
I love you honey
Imagine how my daddy felt
In your jet black suspender belt
Seventeen years old
He's touching sixty four
You got legs right up to your neck
You're making me a physical wreck
I'm talking to you
Hot legs
In your satin shoes
Hot legs
Are you still in school?
Hot legs
You're making me a fool
I love you honey
You might also likeHot legs
Making your mark
Hot legs
You keep my pencil sharp
Hot legs
Keep your hands to yourself
I love you honey
Hot legs
You're wearing me out
Hot legs
You can scream and shout
Hot legs
You're still in school
I love you honey!1Embed
