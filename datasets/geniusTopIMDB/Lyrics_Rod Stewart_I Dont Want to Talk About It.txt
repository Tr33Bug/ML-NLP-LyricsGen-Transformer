I Donâ€™t Want to Talk About It Lyrics
I can tell by your eyes
That you've probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you
They're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart
If I stand all alone
Will the shadow hide the color of my heart?
Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
The stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you
They're a mirror

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart


I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke this ole heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart
My heart
Oh, my heart
