(I Know) Iâ€™m Losing You Lyrics
Your love is fading, can feel your love fading
Woman, it's fading away from me

'Cause your personal touch it's growin' cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I fooled myself as long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Oh, honey, I'm losing you
Can feel in the air
It's there everywhere
Oh, I'm losing you
I can feel it in my bones
Any day, you'll be up and gone
Woo, I'm losing you
It's all over your face
Some one's taken my place
Could it be that I'm losing you?
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me, woo
Your love is fading, can feel it fading
Oh, away from me
Can feel it in the air
It's there everywhere
Ooh, I'm losing you
I don't wanna lose ya
But I know I'm gonna grew ya
Oh Lord, I'm losing you
Woo

Get out
Woo
Woohoo
Ooh yeah
Get down
Get down there
Woo

I don't wanna lose ya
But I know I'm gonna grew ya
Oh no, I'm losing you, I'm losing you
Woo
Woo
Woo
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Woo
Your love is fading, I can feel it fading
Oh, I'm losing youYou might also likeEmbed
