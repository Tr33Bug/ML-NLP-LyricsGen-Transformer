Love Is Lyrics
And so you come to me with your questions
On a subject on which I'm well-versed
Though I'm still as dumbfounded as the first time I found her
It's either a blessing or a curse
Although I cannot offer solutions
It would be reckless of me to try
Cause it's mystified man ever since time began
But hold on to your hat and I'll try

Love is like a burning arrow
It can pierce the coldest heart
Love is warm, love is patient
And the craziest thing you'll ever start, alright
I recall when I was a young man
A day I'm never allowed to forget
There was a girl that I met who I dreamed I would wed
Forever our lives entwined
She said "You gotta stop worrying about the future
You know we're far too young for that
I wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring."
I never saw her pretty face again

Love is life, love is yearning
It does not boast, but speaks the truth
Love is fair and knows no boundaries
And the craziest thing you'll ever do, oh yeah
Come on now

I wish you well in all of your travels
And may you find what you're searching for
It'll hit you like thunder when you find one another
And stay in your heart forevermore

Love is like a four-leaf clover
Hard to find and hold onto
Love is blind, love is tender
And the craziest thing you'll ever do
