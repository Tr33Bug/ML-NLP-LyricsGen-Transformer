My Heart Canâ€™t Tell You No Lyrics
I don't want you to come 'round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
'Cause when you say it's over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
But one look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart can't tell you no

I don't want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
You're crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
Still I want to hold you, touch you
When you look at me that way
There's only one solution, I know it
You gotta stay away from me
Stay away from me

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I won't lose control
One look in your sad eyes
And suddenly my heart can't tell you no
My heart can't tell you no
You might also like
I don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
'Cause when you say it's over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you

When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Don't you know it's torture
I mean it's a living hell
Living hell...Embed
