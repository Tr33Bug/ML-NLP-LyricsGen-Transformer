Ooh La La Lyrics
Poor old Granddad, I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
They'll trap you, then they use you
And before you even know
For love is blind and you're far too kind
Don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
The can-can such a pretty show
It's steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
The dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long
'Fore they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Woo!
Woo!

When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more, then she's fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, just like me
And that's the hardest way
You might also like
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

Ooh la la
Ooh la la, yeah yeah
Ooh la la
Ooh la la, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Ooh la la
Ooh la la
Ooh la la, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
