Sailing Lyrics
I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again 'cross the sea
I am sailing stormy waters
To be near you, to be free

I am flying, I am flying
Like a bird 'cross the sky
I am flying, passing high clouds
To be with you, to be free
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Thro' the dark night, far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Thro' the dark night far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

We are sailing, we are sailing
Home again 'cross the sea
We are sailing stormy waters
To be near you, to be free

Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh (My) Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh Lord
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh (My) Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh LordYou might also like4Embed
