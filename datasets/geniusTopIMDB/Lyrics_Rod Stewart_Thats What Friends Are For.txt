Thatâ€™s What Friends Are For Lyrics
Oh, I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I've got a chance to say
That I do believe I love you
And if I, I should ever go away
Well then, close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smilin' (Smilin')
Keep shining' (Shinin')
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For the good times (Good times)
And the bad times (Bad times)
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for, yeah
And now, though you heard it all before
Well, I tell you one more time
So I can be completely sure
So you know how much I love you
And if I should ever go away
Well then, close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do this day
And then if you can remember

Keep smilin' (Smilin')
Keep shining' (Shinin')
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For the good times (Good times)
And the bad times (Bad times)
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are forYou might also likeEmbed
