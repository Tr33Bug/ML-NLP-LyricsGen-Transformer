The Best Days of My Life Lyrics
You always said living with me was impossible
Try it I said just like the wind I'm changeable
We ain't got money but we sure got laughs
Lots of loving too
So I confess on my behalf
You're giving me honestly
The best days of my life

Your whispering girls said don't be a fool
Don't give into him
He's an animal treat you like dirt
Then he'll turn you in
You two are not compatible
It'll never never last
They said I wasn't even suitable
But you're giving me honestly
The best days of my life

Sometimes I wonder
Why does she bother with me at all
So staid in my ways
Let's face it, my dear, I'm insufferable
The crazy nights spilling into days
With all my noisy friends
But they all love you as much as i
Giving me constantly
The best days of my life

And a day without you at this point my dear
Seems unthinkable
A night without you more often
Than not is unbearable
But if it all can't work out
One can never never tell
In my heart there is no doubt
You gave to me unselfishly
The best days of my life

You might also like
But if it all can't work out one can never never tellEmbed
