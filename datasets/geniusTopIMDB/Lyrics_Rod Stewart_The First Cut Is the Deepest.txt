The First Cut Is the Deepest Lyrics
I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's taken just all that I had
But if you want, I'll try to love again

Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
When it come to being lucky, she's cursed
When it come to loving me, she's worst
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
And if you want, I'll try to love again

Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
And when it come to being lucky, she's cursed
When it come to loving me, she's worst

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you want, I'll try to love again

Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
When it come to being lucky, she's cursed
When it come to loving me, she's worstYou might also likeEmbed
