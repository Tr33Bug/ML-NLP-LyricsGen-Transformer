This Old Heart of Mine Lyrics
This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I feel you're gonna stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love that I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going 'cause
I love you, yes I do, this old heart
I love you, yes I do, yes I do, wait for me

I try hard to hide, my hurt inside
This old heart of mine, always keeps me crying
The way you're treatin' me, leaves me incomplete
You're here for the day, gone for the week

But if leave me a hundred times, a hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours, whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it, tell the world about it 'cause

I love you, this old heart weeps for you
And I love you, I love you, this old heart weeps for you

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love that I feel inside, girl
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going 'cause

I love you, yes I do, this old heart of mine weeps for you
I love you, yes I do, I love you, this old heart, darling, weeps for you
I love you, this old heart of mine weeps for you
Love you, yes I do, I love you, this old heart, darling, weeps for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do, I love you, oh yeahYou might also likeEmbed
