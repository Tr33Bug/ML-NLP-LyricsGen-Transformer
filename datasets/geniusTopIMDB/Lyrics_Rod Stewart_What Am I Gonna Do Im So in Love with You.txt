What Am I Gonna Do (Iâ€™m So in Love with You) Lyrics
Can I tell you what you mean to me?
You're as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe that you're mine
You're like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
Yes, you are

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey
What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

One in a million, oh, so rare
A nightingale in Berkeley Square
And baby, I ain't goin' nowhere without you
You are the goal that wins the game
The very last bus home in the rain
You're like rock and roll and champagne
All in one

Something you've got is something I need right now
Let's not mess around anymore
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?
What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

I'll be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you any time
The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrow's fashion and now I've found you
I'm complete
You might also like
Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

I'm like a schoolboy in your hands
I wanna get up and sing and dance
You see one hell of a happy man standing here
Individually quite unique
You really swept me off my feet
And baby, you look, oh, so neat
With nothing onEmbed
