Winter Wonderland Lyrics
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: "No man"
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Ah yeah winter wonderland
Oh yeah winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
(In the meadow we can build a snowman)
And pretend that he's a circus clown
(And pretend that he's a circus clown)
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening (Sleigh bells ring)
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
We're walking in a winter wonderland (Wonderland)You might also likeEmbed
