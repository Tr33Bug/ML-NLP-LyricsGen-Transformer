Dumb Girl Lyrics
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb

Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

I seen you jockin' J.C. 'cause he got a Mercedes
And you know about his ladies and all his babies
You just wanna ride and get inside
And run around town like Bonnie and Clyde
But, see, the moves you're makin', the route you're takin'
Will lead to heartbreakin' and I'm not mistaken'
You like his money, you'll be his honey
Get the truth, no excuse, you're a great big dummy, dumb girl
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb (Dumb girl)
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

I wish I knew why a girl like you
Wants to do all the things that you do
I know you want a man, but you should understand
That J.C. ain't D, you shouldn't be his fan
You're not just fine, you're out of your mind
And I wrote this rhyme just for your kind
Don't be misled, remember what I said
The rhymes of rappers surely knock some sense in your head, dumb girl

Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb (Dumb girl)
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb (Now)

Now you're the flyest girl in the whole school
But they don't call you fly, they call you fool
Because you don't go to class, you will not pass
You like to go, but you should slow, because you're goin' too fast
And I can tell that you're dumb when you walk in the place
Walkin' round with your thumb cold stuck in your face
Always sinnin', never winnin' 'cause you're last in the race
You get high and tell a lie and think that makes you the ace, dumb girl
You might also like
Stupid, the girl is
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Now you're a stupid sex fiend with no will power (Power)
Had four guys in the bathroom at your last baby shower
All the guys call you fast (Fast) but I call you slow (Slow)
Always sniffin' or givin' (Givin') somebody a blow (Blow)
Givin' every guy a try (Try) at the wink of an eye (Eye)
There's somethin' that you're missin' that money can't buy (Buy)
When it comes to love, you're even hated by Cupid (Cupid)
You're (Silly) dilly (Dumb) and you're just plain stupid, dumb girl

Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb (Stupid), dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb (Dumb girl)
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
The girl is
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

I hope you to listen to the words that I speak
I'm not playin', what I'm sayin' can never be weak
You should use your brain, but you don't have one
And when it comes to sense, you don't have none
Yo, yo, you should know where I'm comin' from
But you're just dumb, diddy, dumb, diddy-diddy, dumb-dumb, dumb girl
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb (Dumb with a capital D), dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb (Dumb girl)
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb (Stupid as can be, breakdown)

Dumb
The girl is
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb-dumb, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb (Dumb girl)
Dumb girl (Dumb)
The girl is dumb1Embed
