Ghostbusters LyricsGHOSTBUSTERS!
I ain't afraid of no ghosts (3X)
GHOSTBUSTERS!
	Something strange goin on
Something's wrong
	Gloom in the room
Outside is the storm
All alone in the crib
Watchin the tube
	Yo-o-o-o is that what I think?
Did I see somethin move?
	Chill down your spine
Your heart fills with fright
Not filled by the things
That GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT
They walk through the walls
With no time to stall
	You call the GHOSTBUSTERS
Well that's who you call!
GHOSTBUSTERS!
We ain't-we ain't-we
We ain't afraid of no ghosts
GHOSTBUSTERS!
We ain't-we ain't-we

We ain't-we ain't-we
We ain't afraid of no ghosts

I-I-I, I-I-I ain't afraid of no ghosts
GHOSTBUSTERS!
GHOSTBUSTERS!
	All alone on the phone
So whassup with that noise?
The wife's at work and I'm no jerk
And I just left my boys
? at school and I'm no fool
And I got no time to waste
So you get up and call, don't trip and fall
Go outside and leave the place
Now it's no dream because you seein
A shadow in the night
But we will come and get it done
So don't worry save your fright
Now there's a group who likes to troop
And you know you can trust us
So don't get nervous cause at your service

GHOSTBUSTERS!
	Aight aight aight
I remember the time, I visited the grave
My life on the line, only my life to save
All by myself, with no one around
Did not understand a hand comin out the ground
I knew it wasn't mine, it was somebody else
But I didn't care G, I just screamed for HELP!
Then - GHOSTBUSTERS - had strapped to their back
Screamin - GHOSTBUSTERS - those 'busters attacked
"We are your friendly neighborhood ghostbusters,"
That's what they said to me
"We are the busters of any, G-H-O-S-T"
GHOSTBUSTERS!
I ain't-I ain't-I ain't
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
GHOSTBUSTERS!
I ain't-I ain't-I ain't
I ain't afraid of no ghosts
	Howling haunting
	Scaring screaming
	Ghostly ghosts
	Ghouling demons!
	Monsters spooks
	Werewolves and devils
	All those things
	on the same level
	Nightmares (bad dreams) cannot be beat
It takes a brave man (to stand in defeat)
Must be the bravest (yo, the bravest and most)
You must be able to say, "I ain't afarid of no ghosts"
	A good sense of humor, is important to have
When a ghost tries to scare you (ha, don't make me laugh)
They be dustin off ghosts, like true ghost-dusters
	Go, go, go, go, ghoooooosstbusters!
GHOSTBUSTERS!

Busters, busters!
One time in the house
Peace to everybody out there
We love ya, peace
