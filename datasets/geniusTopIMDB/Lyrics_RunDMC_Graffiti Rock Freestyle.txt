“Graffiti Rock” Freestyle Lyrics
One for the treble, two for the bass
Come on Jam Master, let's rock the place
I'm a dominator in my field
And when it comes to rap, other rappers yield
Cause when it comes to rap, I'm the epitome
The rappers' idol, and my title is Kool Moe Dee

They call me iller than iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
One def rapper, cold know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool & the Gang
Well, I'm one of the chosen few
So when you need that lift just to get you through
All you have to do is say Special K
And help is on the way

Well, I'm D.M.C. in the place to be
And the place to be is with D.M.C
And by the time I'm through, you will agree
No other emcees rock the house like me

Well, I'm the coolest of the cool, they call me Moe Dee
It ain't another rapper who's as bad as me
I got a high-powered voice, I'm the party peoples' choice
I got so many rhymes, you gotta take invoice

Now party people, I'm so happy I don't know what to do
Cause I'm the emcee with the rock, cold down with the crew
Rhyme from Africa to France, and then to Kalamazoo
And every place that I play, I hear a "Yeah" and a "Woo!"

Well, I know that when a party is packed
You need a guide to show you when and where to react
You need a motivator -- that means you'll need me
Special K, huh, from the Treacherous Three
You might also like
D.M.C., that's who I am
I love to perform, but I'm not a ham
My mother said, "Do it". I said, "Yes, ma'am"
And I can do it cause I know I can

Well, don't touch that dial -- just sit tight

If you liked that battle, huh, that was light

I know you're gonna love this next act

Cause we'll have Shannon when we get back
