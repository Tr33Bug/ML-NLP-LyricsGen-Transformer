Hit It Run Lyrics
Born to rock around the clock
You can't say I'm not
And in case you forgot
I'm the king of rock!

I'm the devastating mic controller D.M.C
And can't nobody mess around with me
I'm the king of rock, rap, and of rhyme
I deal what I feel and it feels fine
If the sound from the Jay then I won't play
Around with sound, put down for the rhymes I say
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's rock
Hit it, Run


You just watch your clock while I rock your spot
I'm better known to the world as the king of rock
I like to speak my piece when I'm on the mic
I'm the best, or at least, I'm the one you like
And when I serve, you deserve to hear what I say
I throw a curve, he got the nerve to make a triple play
Now, how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D
Hit it, Run


It's called gangsta hard rock, non-stop hip-hop
And it's headed for the top by the rhymes I pop
For every race, place, color, country, county, or creed
And all of the places that I emceed
B-boy badness to the highest degree
And you can't be a boy unless you be D
You can't bust a cherry or crush a grape
And if you ain't got this tape, you're in bad shape
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's (Rock)
You might also like

Do you really believe what's going on?
I was conceived and I was born
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Tell your bunch I'm boss, I run this town
I leave all suckers in the dust
Those dumb motherfuckers can't mess with us
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's rock
Hit it, Run


I was straight from the start performing art
Climbing up the chart while others fall apart
The three outlaws in the music trade
We won't rob, but our job is to get paid (Paid)
'Cause Run has fun if Jay will play
As I add one more rhyme to say
Now, how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D
Hit it, Run


I was born son of Byford, brother of Al
Bannah's my mamma and Run's my pal
It's McDaniels, not McDonald's
These rhymes are Darryl's, the burgers are (Ronald's)
I ran down my family tree
My mother, my father, my brother, and D

Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master JayEmbed
