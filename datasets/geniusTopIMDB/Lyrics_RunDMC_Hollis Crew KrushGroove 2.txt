Hollis Crew (Krush-Groove 2) LyricsSucker MC's who did not learn
If you don't this time, we shall return
The beat is big, it's kind of large
And when we're on the mic, we're in charge
It's like that y'all (that y'all) like that y'all (that y'all)
Like that-a-tha-that a-like that y'all (that y'all)
Cool chief rocker, I don't drink vodka
But keep a microphone inside my locker
Go to school everyday, on the side makin' pay
'Cause I'm rockin' on the mic until the break of day
And now the things I do make me a star
And you could be too if you know who you are
Just put your mind to it, you'll go real far
Like a pedal to the metal when you're drivin' a car
...Liggy-liggy-liggy-listen to the things that I say
Because it's not routine, it's the way I play
Just come out my mouth all time of the day
And then I must have time to give it away
Hey, they used to call me Easy D
'Cause I rapped on the mic so easily
But now they call me D.M.C
(He's) the Emcee of the party
The D's for doin it all of the time
The M's for the rhymes that are all mine
The C's for cool, cool as can be
(And why you wear those glasses?) So I can see
Huh-huh
Got rhymes so def, rhymes, rhymes galore
Rhymes that you never even heard before
Now if you say you heard my rhymes, we're gonna have to fight
'Cause I just made the super-def rhymes last night
You might also likeMicrophone master, super rhyme maker
I get def as the others get faker
It's me, D.M.C. in the place to be
And I still got the same old harmony
I'm the devastatin' mic-controller
The word wizard and the chief rock roller
Bad b-boy made for the b-girls
Rock ruler rhymes as the turntable twirls
Supreme being who was born to talk
And over sucker MC's all day I walk
A few years ago my name was Joe
And then I went to a party, cold stole the show
Stole it as sure as birds have wings
Now they're callin' me DJ Running Things
Got Kurtis Blow down with the two
And my man Larry Lah makes beats for you
Keepin' up the funky beat is the Hollis Crew
So Dee, take the mic cause you know I'm through
In case you wonder what all this means
We're funky fresh from Hollis, Queens
Run and Kurt both down with me
And that's the way it's meant to be
I'm the microphone master D.M.C
Devastatin' mic-controller personality
And to the sucker MC's who did not learn
If you don't this time we shall return...1Embed
