Is It Live Lyrics
The microphone master D.M.C
Cause one, two, three, four casualties
You'll be praisin' D down on your knees
'Cause I'm poppin', and droppin', stoppin' all MC's

Connect, eject, and collect respect
Get down to the sound 'cause I come correct
So when I write, don't bite, and I might check
And if I find your behind, I'll break your neck
It's the world rhymin' rapper ready to have fun
You'll reason with the record 'cause it's made by Run
It's def, you was left in a total stun
So bust a move while I prove who's number one
Got quality and skill both beyond belief
Do I steal? Be for real, I'm not a thief
Dictator and hater of those that beef
That's right, I can fight, and I'm the chief

People in the place don't put D down
I'm the microphone master the best around
There's not too many of my type
And all rap titles I will swipe
You'll see me talkin' to a girl
A sweet young thing with Jheri curls
I never ever wore a braid
Got the peasiest hair and still get paid

Well I'm dropping MC's with just one punch
'Cause it's the baddest on the booth so call me Captain Crunch
Slayin MC's, make 'em walk the plank
And what's next? Start the decks while I count my bank

And I'm the wizard of words, the ruler of rap
Not soft, not a sucka', could never be a sap
You might get jacked 'cause you talk crap
When I bust my rap, they all step back
I'm paid on stage, Run's on my left
On his right, on the mic, I recite, I'm def
Because every performer is only a goner
Keep all sissy soft sucka's off my corner

Is it, is it, is-is it live?
Is it, is it, is-is it live?
Live
Is-is-is it live?
Is it, is it live?
Is it live?
'Cause Darryl Mac will do things like that

The sophisticated sound, not soft or sour
It's servin' you suckas, sellin' dreams in the shower
It's rockin' this party hour, hour after hour
If a girly tried to diss this (What's up with that?)
I won't allow her
Cool chief rapper, I see a girl, I tap her
Then I take her on the floor, she don't dance, I slap her
The girl starts to cry and the crowd asks me why
If Run says "Dance", you do or die1Embed
