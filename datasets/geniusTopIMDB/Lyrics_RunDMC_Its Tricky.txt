TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsIt’s Tricky Lyrics
This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock a rhyme that's right on time, "It's Tricky" is the title (Here we go)

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tr-tr-tr-tricky, tricky, tricky

I met this little girlie, her hair was kind of curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is, "Please me"
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said, "It's not that easy"
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it D?)
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky

In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really hawk, but we just walk because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it D?)
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky, huh

When I wake up, people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me

We are not thugs, we don't use drugs, but you assume on your own
They offer coke and lots of dope, but we just leave it alone
It's like that, y'all, y'all, but we don't quit
You keep on rock shock 'cause this is it25Embed
