Mary, Mary Lyrics
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

Had a fly girl Flo, called her honey
Next thing she spent up all my money
Had me in debt, you and your girl’s dizzy
Stopped movin’ crack, but you’re still gettin’ pissy
You could call me everyday God sent
Like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent
I spend and I spend and you spent and you spent
Now my house with a mouse is a roach with a tent
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

Mary-Mary-Mary, you cold thumb suckin’
Lookin’ for you, but you keep duckin’
I wanna find you, I gotta tell you somethin’
So just be quiet and don’t say (Nuttin’)
Mary-Mary-Mary, why you out there stuntin’?
Supposed to be with me, but not you’re frontin’
We started out new, you used to be true
Now you’re buggin’, what’s wrong with you?

“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

Now! This girl Mary I knew so well
I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never failed
(Clubs and the pubs is where she dwelled)
Story about Mary was well to tell
She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent a night locked in a cell
I knew Mary well cause she “Raising Hell”
You might also like
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

It’s not Mary who was quite contrary
Talkin’ bout Mary who was always in a hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she’s crazy and I’ll say very
Livin’ in a house that’s out on the prairie
I worry about Mary, cause Mary is scary

“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?4Embed
