My Adidas Lyrics
My Adidas walk through concert doors
And roam all over coliseum floors
I stepped on stage, at Live Aid
All the people gave, and the poor got paid
And out of speakers I did speak
I wore my sneakers but I'm not a sneak
My Adidas touch the sand of a foreign land
With mic in hand, I cold took command
My Adidas and me close as can be
We make a mean team, my Adidas and me
We get around together, we're down forever
And we won't be mad when caught in bad weather
My Adidas
(Uh)
My Adidas
(Uh)
Yo, what's up?
My Adidas, standin' on two fifth street
Funky fresh and yes, cold on my feet
With no shoestring in 'em, I did not win 'em
I bought 'em off the ave' with the black Lee denim
I like to sport 'em, that's why I brought 'em
A sucker tried to steal 'em so I caught 'em and I fought 'em
And I walk down the street, and bop to the beat
With Lee on my legs and Adidas on my feet
And so now I'm just standin' here shootin' the gip
Me and D and my Adidas standing on two fifth
My Adidas
My Adidas

Now me and my Adidas do the illest things
We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
We slay all suckers who perpetrate
And lay down law from state to state
We travel on gravel, dirt road or street
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat
On stage front page, every show I go
It's Adidas on my feet, high top or low
My Adidas
My Adidas
You might also like
What up, what up, what up?

Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare
Myself, homeboy got fifty pair
Got blue and black, 'cause I likes to chill
And yellow and green when it's time to get ill
Got a pair that I wear when I'm playin' ball
With the heel inside, make me ten feet tall

My Adidas only bring good news
And they are not used as felon shoes
They're black and white, white with black stripes
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of a famous university
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen
Hollywood knows we're good, if you know what I mean
We started in the alley, now we chill in Cali
And I won't trade my Adidas for no  beat up Bally's
