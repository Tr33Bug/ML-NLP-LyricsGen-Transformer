Pause LyricsAfros.... yeahhh
AFROS!  Yeahhh
Brothers be out there doin crack... NOOOOOOO
They be doin dope... NOOOOOOO
They be gangbangin!  NOOOOOOO
All them brothers need to just
Pause
Yeah I'm with that
Here comes the Afros, and the forty ounce crew
Who say slowly but surely, we gonna turn the mother out
We got more, in store, young ladies on the floor, so cool out
Pause
Intro, which means I start it
In other words, herbs departed
Pause, stop for the cause
Get up, get down, you get yours
Chill, no time to get ill
Word to herb -- yeah it's the will of God
So whassup Hobbes?
Just jock, clock, rock, and don't stop but
Pause
Pause, pause for the cause, get yours
But don't break laws
Quit, quit it, forget it
Pause, say your way with it
Pause, if you did it, admit it
Cause, you shouldn'ta did it
Next time, you think of doin a crime
Pause, and remember this rhyme
Pause for the cause, cause broken laws
Are just like broken jaws
They take a long time to heal
I'm for real, and I know the deal
Look it over, investigate
Evaluate, think!
Life is wrong, and full of flaws
Before you break laws just pause!
You might also likeI think that worked man (4X)
Pause
Yeah pause, this beat is dope D
I'm tellin you, this beat is dope, just slammin, it's dope
Well if it's dope, I hope it's not crack
Or coke, or nuttin like somethin you EVER smoke
And if they offer you some say NO
Or pause
The reason I wrote this rhyme, is not to climb
But just to tell all mankind
That the use and abuse of drugs -- will what?
Will, blow, your, mind
Like dough makes bread, it goes straight to your head
You're misled and then you're dead
Now that's not fly, when you die
On a high
Like a trip, oooh, you make me sick
Ill, lookin like doo doo on a stick
You don't have to be a vic
Life is like a flick, so pause
Pause, p-pause, pause, p-p-pause
Alright y'all, now that you understand
My man Run never ran
I'm gonna take this mic yo my hand
And hand this to the one man band
Now pause, now pause
I'm Jay, I make up the trey
Now check out the dance that I display
It's called the pause
A new thing, on the dancefloor
First you move, then you stop
Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because
It's called the pause
Slammin, the dance is slammin
Pause, the people are jammin
Stop again, back to the groove
I show you how to move
Pause
It's simple, just like stop and go
You can pause on the fast or slow
Participate, won't you all get down
Here's a solo from my homeboy Stanley Brown
Ahh yeah, I like this R&B shit...
Pause, pause, one more time!
Yeah, do that, do that...
Now pause!Embed
