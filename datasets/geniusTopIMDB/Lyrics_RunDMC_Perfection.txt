Perfection Lyrics
Everyone out there ready?
It goes a-one, two, three, and

Perfection to D is quite essential
He has to live up to his potential
I work real hard all day and night
I get to it and do it 'cause I want it right
I got bass, tone, I use cologne
And then I rock the funky rhyme on the microphone
I got a funky fresh car with the funky fresh bar
I'm a funky fresh star and I'm up to par
My name is D.M.C. down with Run and Jay
Is everything copacetic, y'all? Kind of a-okay
Perfection (Yo, yo, yo, what we talkin 'bout, what we talkin 'bout?)
Perfection (Most definitely)

I got prescription glasses and my eyes are correct
Two times every year I go to have them checked
Perfection's my selection, and I will select
And if it's not (Perfect) I will perfect

Perfection (What we got?)
Perfection (Who me? Iâ€” talkin' 'bout me?)

I got a credit card made out of gold
I get cash in a flash and the story's told
I got D.M.C., I got JMJ
I got Jeff, he's def, and Runny-Ray
I got a dog, a cat, a mouse, a rat
A fly, he won't die, and a little gnat
My name is DJ Run and he's Darryl Mack
Run-D.M.C., right and exact

Perfection
Perfection (C'mon, let's get 'em, tell 'em, D)
You might also like
I won't fail, I won't flop
Stall or stutter, yes, I won't stop
It takes hard work to be like this
You should know 'cause I'm a perfectionist

Perfection
Perfection
Perfection (Yo, DJ Run, what is it?)
Perfection (Perfectly speaking)
Perfection
Perfection (P-P-P-P)
Perfection (P-P-P-Perfect)
Perfection (Perfectly speaking)
Perfection (P-P-P-P, 100 percent)
Perfection (Roll, roll, roll, c'mon, c'mon c'mon)
Perfection (Word, there it is)1Embed
