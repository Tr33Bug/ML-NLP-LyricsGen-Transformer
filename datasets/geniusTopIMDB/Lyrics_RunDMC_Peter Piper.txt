Peter Piper Lyrics
Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rocked rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time
Jack B. Nimble was nimble and he was quick
But Jam Master cut faster, Jack's on Jay's dick
Now Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip Van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice chilling somewhere in Wonderland
Jack's serving Jill a bucket in his hand
And Jam Master Jay's making all that sound
The turntables might wobble, but they don't fall down
Now Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing
But Jam Master's getting loose and D.M.C.'s the king
'Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timing when I'm climbing, I'm a rhyming apparatus
Lot of guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix real quick and I'd like to say
He's not Flash, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It, it goes a one, two, three, and

Jay's like King Midas as I was told
Everything that he touch turn to gold
He's the greatest of the greater, get it straight, he's great
Playing fame 'cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay, to see him play, will make you say
"God damn that DJ made my day"
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were kids he would be due
Not lying y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie my nose will grow
Like a little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story go
You might also like
Tricks are for kids, he plays much gigs
He's a big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's a big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good

There it is

We're Run-D.M.C., got a beef to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat, others get thinner
J-j-j-j-j, jump on Jay like cow jumps moon
People chase Jay like dish and spoon
And like all fairy tales end
You'll see Jay again my friend, huh9Embed
