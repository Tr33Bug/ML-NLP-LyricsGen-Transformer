Rock the House Lyrics
And this is the way...
We rock the house!
Ha hah...
Ya don't...
Ya can't...
And I don't...
Ya don't stop!
D...M...C...
Huh...
I'm the King of Rock, there is none higher...
Sire!
To burn my kingdom, FIRE...
Re-TIRE...

Now we rock the party and come correct...
BREAK!
Now we crash through walls...
The CEILING!
 On the tape
 We're fresh out the box

And this is the way...
We rock the house!
NOT...
Never.. ever...
Huh...
Ha hah...
Hah!
Yah...
Get it right boy...
You might also like Sure shot...

And this is the way...
We rock the house!
And that's the way...yeah...
 Supreme...
Fever!
 Born to talk...
Take a walk...
 Back up...
 Step off!
Punk...frontin...
 Bad...
 B-Boys!…B-Girls!…
 Tough...
 City...??...ha hah, ha hah
