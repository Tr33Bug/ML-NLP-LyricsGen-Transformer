Son of Byford Lyrics
Ayo, Jay, yo, Jay, check this out

I was born son of Byford, brother of Al
Bannah's my mama and Run's my pal
It's McDaniels, not McDonald's
These rhymes are Darryl's, those burgers are Ronald's
I ran down my family tree
My mother, my father, my brother and D, huh
Oh, y'all on that tip now, huh?You might also like1Embed
