Together Forever (Krush-GrooveÂ 4)  Lyrics* expanded enhanced re-release

Ayo man, can we see them mics man?

One two, one two, and I say...

Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we're not just rough, we're more than tough
And when it comes to rhymes, we got enough
It's like that y'all, and we don't stop the body rock
Now it's together (forever) forever (together)
Run-D.M.C. and we're tougher than leather
We're making and breaking and snatching and taking
The deal's for real we could never be faking

I'm chilling, he's cooling, I'm a king that's ruling
Preach and teach and always schooling

See, we're learning, and earning, the tables keep turning
To be like us, you could cold be yearning
Pulsating dominating up above
Cold chilling and I'm willing, the name's Run-Love

Creating devastating in the place to be
Full of soul and mic control because it's easy to "D"

Beat making, never faking, chilling all of the time
For playing rhyme saying, and I get mine

No way to rock me, no way to stop me
It's seems quite shocking to those that mock me
And that's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and plan for my downfall
But I'm not running, I'm just stunning
Smart not stupid cause I'm so cunning
MC's regret it, I'm upsetting
My recitals take titles and titles I'm betting
You might also like
Like that y'all, so just keep above
See my name is DJ Run, they call me Run-Love
Creative creator, creating the rhyme
Devastating devastator not doing a crime
Making beats every day, and I get mine
The biggest star going far, so check the shine
Big winner, not a sinner when I do my thing
I might have a sling or a fling cause I'm down with the king
Biggest rap no crap, I do not sing
You want a show, let me know, just give me your ring
Like that y'all, we're just keeping it on
D.M.C. my man, to the break of dawn rock

I'm ill, I chill, with skill I kill
And none of my rhymes are run of the mill
I cause grief, I'm chief, there is no beef
And if there's beef I knock out teeth
MC's act dumb, they know where I'm from
The King from Queens and I'm down with Run

I take a stand my man, and I won't sit
Cause I'm the real deal, like Coke is it
Then you won't find my name in the yellow page
Cause Run only speaks when it's on the stage
I got a rhyme in line that's easy to find
With a sketch so check, so one of a kind
Got two MC's and one DJ
Grab at least 20 G's when we play
So D.M.C. my boy, my mellow my man
So get on the mic and won't you take the stand
My rock is hard, you can't pull my card
I'm a shining star, shining near and far
Shining like the sun on a day of fun
Always on the move cause I'm down with Run
I'm the cool and calm, I'm the calm and cool
I'm not a fool, I went to school
My name is D.M.C. I tell no lie
And I graduated from Cooley High
I am the only rapper who will not die
I'm a greusome guy, and you can try
To battle D.M.C. but you must be highEmbed
