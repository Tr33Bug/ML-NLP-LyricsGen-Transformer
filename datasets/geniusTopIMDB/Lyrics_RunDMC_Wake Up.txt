Wake Up Lyrics(Wake up) (wake up)
(Get up)
(Wake up) (wake up)
(Get up)
(Wake up)
When I woke up this morning and got out the bed
I had some really fresh thoughts going through my head
They were the thoughts that came from a wonderful dream
It was the vision of a world working as a team
It was a dream (get up)
Just a dream (wake up), (wake up) (get up)
There were no guns, no what
No tanks, no what, atomic bombs
And to be frank homeboy there were no arms
Just people, working hand in hand
There was a feeling of peace all across the land
It was a dream (wake up)
Just a dream (get up) (wake up) (wake up)
Between all countries there were good relations
There finally was a meaning to united nations
And everybody had an occupation
'Cause we all worked together to fight starvation
It was a dream (wake up)
Just a dream (wake up) (get up)
Everyone was treated on an equal basis
No matter what colors, religions or races
We weren't afraid to show our faces
It was cool to chill in foreign places
It was a dream (get up)
Just a dream (wake up) (wake up) (get up)
(Wake up) (wake up) (get up) (wake up)

And the people all chilled and celebrated
They were all so happy and elated
To live in the world that they created
It was a dream (get up)
Just a dream (wake up) (wake up) (get up)
There were no street people, we live rent free
And every single person had a place to be
A job, a home and the perfect pay
And the world was free of greed and hate
It was a dream (wake up)
Just a dream (get up) (wake up) (wake up)
Unemployment was at a record low
And the presidents were chillin at our show
Listening to the things that we had to say
And trying to create a new and brighter day
It was a dream (wake up)
Just a dream (wake up)
It was a dream (get up)
Just a dream (wake up)
It was a dream (wake up)
Just a dream (get up)
It was dream (wake up)
Just a dream  (wake up)
(Get up) (wake up) (wake up)
(Get up) (wake up) (wake up)
(Get up) (wake up) (wake up)
(Get up) (wake up) (wake up)Embed
