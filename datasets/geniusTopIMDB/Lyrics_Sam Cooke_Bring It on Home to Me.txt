Bring It on Home to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind

[Chorus]
Baby (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
[Chorus]
Baby (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

[Verse 3]
I'll give you jewelry and money, too
That ain't all, that ain't all I'll do for you

[Chorus]
Baby if you (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

[Verse 4]
You know I'll always be your slave
'Till I'm buried, buried in my grave

[Chorus]
Oh honey (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
