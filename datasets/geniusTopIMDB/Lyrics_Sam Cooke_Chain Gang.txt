Chain Gang Lyrics[Intro]
Hoh ah, hoh, I hear something saying
Hoh ah, hoh ah
Uh ah, uh ah

[Chorus]
Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang
[Bridge]
All day long they're saying, huh ah
Huh ah, uh ah, uh ah

[Chorus]
Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang

[Verse 1]
All day long they work so hard
Till the sun is going down
Working on the highways and byways
And wearing, wearing a frown
You hear them moaning their lives away
Then you hear somebody say;

[Chorus]
Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang

Can't you hear them singing, mmm huh hah
I'm going home one of these days huh hah
I'm going home, see my woman huh hah
Whom I love so dear
But meanwhile, I gotta work right here huh hah

[Chorus]
Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain gang

[Outro]
All day long they're singing, mm huh ah
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my work is so hard huh ah
Gimme water, I'm thirsty, my, my work is so hard huh ah
Woah oh, y, my, my, my, my, my, my
My work is so hard huh ah6Embed
