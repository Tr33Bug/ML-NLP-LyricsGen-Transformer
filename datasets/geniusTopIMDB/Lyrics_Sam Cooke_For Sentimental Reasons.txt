For Sentimental Reasons LyricsI love you
For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my
Given you my heart because I mmm you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
I dream of you every night
And I know I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight
I know I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And tell we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Can I help it if I dream of you every night
No, no, no, no, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I know that I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And tell we will never part

My darling I love you
I love youYou might also likeEmbed
