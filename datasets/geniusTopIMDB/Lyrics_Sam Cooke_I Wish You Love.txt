I Wish You Love LyricsI wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss oh but more than this
I wish you love

And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health oh and more than wealth. I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I will never be
So with my best my very best I am setting you free
Oh honey
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
Oh but most of all I wish you love
But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love
But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you loveYou might also likeEmbed
