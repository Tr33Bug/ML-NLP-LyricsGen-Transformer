Iâ€™m in the Mood for Love LyricsI'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh, is it any wonder that
I'm in the mood for love

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We put our hearts together
Now we are one don't be afraid
If there's a cloud above
If it should rain, we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it and get with it
I'm in the mood for loveYou might also likeEmbed
