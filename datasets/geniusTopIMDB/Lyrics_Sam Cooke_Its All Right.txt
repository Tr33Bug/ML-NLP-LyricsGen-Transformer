Itâ€™s All Right Lyrics[Chorus]
Whoa, it's all right
It's all right
It's all right
Honey, it's all right
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Honey, it's all right
It's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
Honey, it's all right (It's all right)
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Baby, it's all right (It's all right)
[Verse 1]
All my friends tell me that you found somebody new
They report to me every little thing that you do
But long as you tell me that it's all untrue
Baby, it's all right (It's all right)

[Chorus]
Whoa, it's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
Believe me when I say it's alright (It's all right)
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Baby, it's all right (It's all right)
No, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
(It's all right)
One more thing I want you to know

[Verse 2]
If you're ever worried
If you're all alone
Just remember, darling, that I'm as near as your telephone
And if you need me, honey, all you've got to do is to call me
Believe me, it's all right (It's all right)
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, it's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
Honey, it's all right (It's all right)
Long as I know, long as I know that you love me
Baby, it's all right (It's all right)

[Outro]
Oh, help me to tell 'em one more time
It's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
It's all right (It's all right)
Honey, long, long, long as I know, long as I know that you love me
It's all rightEmbed
