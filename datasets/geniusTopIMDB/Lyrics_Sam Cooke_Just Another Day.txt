Just Another Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Just another day that my Lord, my Lord has kept me
Yes, it is
Just another day that I've been in my Savior's care
Yes, it is
Wanna say he threw, he threw His loving arms all around me
Yes, He did
And there I found, I found peace, and joy right there

[Verse 2]
Another day (Just another day)
I've been workin' (Just another day)
In God's vineyard (Just another day)
Oh yeah (Just another day)
Another day (Oh, just another day)
You know He kept me (Just another day)
By His side (Just another day)
Oh yeah (Just another day)
He said "I know" (Oh, just another day)
"Just how hard" (Just another day)
"You've been laborin'" (Just another day)
Mhm (Just another day)
He said "I want you" (Oh, just another day)
"To sit down" (Just another day)
"Rest a while" (Just another day)
Oh (Just another day)
[Verse 3]
Well, when I (Just another day)
Get on home (Just another day)
In my God's kingdom (Just another day)
Oh yes (Just another day)
I'm gonna sit down (Just another day)
I'm gonna sit down (Just another day)
All around the throne (Just another day)
Oh lord (Just another day)
And He'll be there (Oh, just another day)
Be there with arms (Just another day)
Spread wide open (Just another day)
Yes, He will (Just another day)
I'm gonna hear him say (Oh, just another day)
"My servant" (Just another day)
"Welcome home" (Just another day)
Oh Lord (Just another day)

[Verse 4]
Another day (Just another day)
I've been workin' (Just another day)
In God's vineyard (Just another day)
Yes, I have (Just another day)
Another day (Oh, just another day)
You know He kept me (Just another day)
By His side (Just another day)
Oh, oh, oh yeah (Just another day)
He said "I know" (Oh, just another day)
"Just how hard" (Just another day)
"You've been laborin'" (Just another day)
Mhm (Just another day)
He said "I want you" (Oh, just another day)
"To sit down" (Just another day)
"Rest a while" (Just another day with Him)You might also likeEmbed
