One More River Lyrics[Verse]
(One more river to cross, ooh)
Before I reach my journey's end
(One more river to cross, ooh)
Before I'll be free from sin
(One more mountain to climb)
Whoa-oh, before I finish this race
(One mover river to cross)
Whoa-oh, before I see my Savior's face
(One more river to cross)
Lord, before I'll be free from fear
(One more river to cross)
Before I'll be through shedding tears
(One more mountain to climb)
Whoa-oh, before I'll be with the blessed
(One more river to cross)
Whoa-oh, before I'll take my, my rest
[Outro]
And I've got one more (One more) river (River)
I've got one more (One more) river (River)
I've got one more (One more) mountain (Mountain)
Before I take my rest
(One more river to cross)
Put the burden down here
They all make just one more (One more) river (River)
Trials is one more (One more) river (River)
Disappointment is one more (One more) mountain (Mountain)
Before I can take my rest
