Summertime LyricsIt's summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good looking
Hush little baby
Don't you cry
Hmmmm....

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you....
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by
Hmmmm...You might also like2Embed
