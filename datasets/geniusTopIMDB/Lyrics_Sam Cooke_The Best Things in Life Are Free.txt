The Best Things in Life Are Free Lyrics[Verse 1]
All the moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life, they're free
Stars belong to everyone
They cling there for you and for me
Flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
They're yours and they're mine
Love can come to everyone
Best things in life, they're free
[Verse 2]
Moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life, they're free
Stars belong to everyone
They glitter there for you and me
They are yours and me
Flowers in spring
The robins that sing
Sunbeams that shine, y'all
They're yours and they're mine, y'all
Love can come to everyone
Best things in life, they're free

[Outro]
All of the good things
Every one of the better things
The best, best things in life they're free
