The Last Mile Of the Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
If I walk in the pathway of duty
If I work 'til the close of the day, Lord, mmm
I shall see the great King in all His beauty
When I've gone the last mile of the way, Lord, yes sir

[Chorus]
When I've gone (When I've gone)
The last mile (The last mile) of the way, oh yeah
(When I've gone the last mile of the way)
I shall rest (I shall rest)
At the close (At the close) of day
(I shall rest at the close of the day)
For I know (For I know)
There are joy (There are joy) await me
(For I know there are joy that await me)
When I've gone (When I've gone)
The last mile (The last mile) of the way
(When I've gone the last mile of the way)
[Verse 2]
If I were, for Christ to proclaim the glad story, oh Lord
If I see for His sheep who gone astray, oh Lord
I am sure He will show me in His glory, hey
When I've gone the last mile of the way, Lord, yes sir

[Chorus]
When I've gone (When I've gone)
The last mile (The last mile) of the way, oh yes
(When I've gone the last mile of the way)
I shall rest (I shall rest)
At the close (At the close) of day, oh yeah
(I shall rest at the close of the day)
For I know (For I know)
There are joy (There are joy) await me
(For I know there are joy that await me)
When I've gone (When I've gone)
The last mile (The last mile) of the way
