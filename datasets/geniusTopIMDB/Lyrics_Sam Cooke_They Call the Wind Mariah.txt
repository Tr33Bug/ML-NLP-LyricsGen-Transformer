They Call the Wind Mariah Lyrics[Verse 1]
Way out west, they've got a name
For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess, the fire's Joe and
They call the wind Mariah
Oh now, Mariah blows the stars around
And sends the clouds a-flying
Mariah makes the mountain sounds
Like folks were up there dying

[Chorus]
Mariah, Mariah
They call the wind Mariah
[Verse 2]
Now before I knew Mariah's name
And heard her wail and whining
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shining
Oh, but then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now I'm lost, I'm oh so lost
Not even God can find me

[Chorus]
Mmm, Mariah, oh, Mariah
They call the wind Mariah

[Verse 3]
Oh, out here they've got a name for rain
For wind and fire only
But when you're lost and all alone
There ain't no word but lonely
Oh yeah, and I'm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me
Mariah, blow my love to me
I need my girl beside me

[Outro]
Mmm, Mariah, oh, Mariah
I'm lonely can't you see
Mmm, Mariah, oh, Mariah
Please blow my love to me
Mariah, blow my love to meYou might also likeEmbed
