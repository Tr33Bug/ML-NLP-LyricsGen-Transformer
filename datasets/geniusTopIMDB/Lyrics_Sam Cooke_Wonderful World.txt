Wonderful World Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

[Chorus 1]
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be
[Verse 2]
Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

[Chorus 2]
But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

[Bridge]
Now, I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me

[Verse 1]
Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

[Chorus 1]
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be
