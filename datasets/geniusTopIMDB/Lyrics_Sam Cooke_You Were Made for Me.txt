You Were Made for Me Lyrics[Intro]
(Made for me)
(You were made for me)

[Verse 1]
A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sail on the sea
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me
You were made for me
[Verse 2]
A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me, mmhmm

[Chorus]
We'll have our quarrels and you'll upset me
But what can I do? Mmm
You've been mine ever since I met you
And I'll never leave you
No, I'll never leave you

[Verse 3]
As sure as there’s a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free
As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me

[Verse 1]
(A fish was made to swim in the ocean)

As sure as there are stars above
I know, I know you were made for me

But what can I do?

Mmm, you've been mine ever since I met you
And I'll never, never, never, never
Never leave you

As sure as there’s a heaven up above me
From you I know I'll never be free, no, no
