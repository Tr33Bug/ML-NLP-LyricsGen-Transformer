You, You, You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You, you, you
I'm in love with you, you, you
I could be so true, true, true
To someone like you, you, you

Do, do, do
What you ought to do, do, do
Take me in your arms, please do
Let me cling to you, you, you
[Bridge]
We were meant for each other
Sure as heaven's above
We were meant for each other
To have, to hold and to love

[Verse 2]
You, you, you
There's no one like you, you, you
You could make my dreams come true
If you say you love me too

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh oh, do, do, do
What you ought to do, do, do
Take me in your arms, please do
Let me cling to you, you, you

[Bridge]
We were meant for each other
Sure as heaven's above
We were meant for each other
To have, to hold and to love
You might also like[Outro]
Oh oh, you, you, you
There's no one like you, you, you
You could make my dreams come true
If you say you love me too
Mmm, you, you, you
I'm in love with youEmbed
