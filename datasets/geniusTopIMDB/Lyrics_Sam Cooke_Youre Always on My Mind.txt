Youâ€™re Always on My Mind LyricsYou're always my mind
Instilled in my heart
You're always on my mind
Although we are apart
You're always, always
Always on my mind

Baby, the reason why I know
I can't forget your face
Cause everywhere I go
I see you everyplace
You're always, always
Always on my mind
Life is so empty
Along with a broken heart
Please, please tell me
Honey, why did we have to part

You know it's you I love
To my heart you hold the key
I pray the stars above
That you hurry back to me
You're always, always
You're always on my mindYou might also likeEmbed
