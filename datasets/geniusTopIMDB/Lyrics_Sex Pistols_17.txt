17 LyricsYou're only 29 got a lot to learn
But when your business (mummy) dies she will not return
We make (like) noise it's our choice it's what we wanna do
We don't care about long hairs i don't wear flares
See my face not a trace no reality
I don't work i just speed that's all i need
I'm a lazy sod
Say you're lazy
I'm a lazy sod
I can't even be bothered
Lazy !You might also likeEmbed
