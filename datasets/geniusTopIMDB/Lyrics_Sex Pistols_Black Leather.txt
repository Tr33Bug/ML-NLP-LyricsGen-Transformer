Black Leather Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh

She's all geared up
Walking down the street
I can feel her slime
Dripping down her teeth

Well, you can't refuse
And you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
I said you can't refuse
And you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
It's late at night
And I'm all alone
I can hear her boots
Getting nearer home

Well, you just can't refuse
And you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
I said you can't refuse
And you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, scratch scratch
She's clawing at the door
Oh, no, I can't take anymore
Crack crack
I feel so sore
I never should have asked for
Black leather black leather

You can try to hide
You know you won't get far
You will let her in
And she'll start again
You might also like
Well, you can't refuse
And you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
I said you can't refuse
And you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, scratch scratch
She's clawing at the door
Oh, no, I can't take anymore
Crack crack
I feel so sore
I never should have asked for
Black leather black leather
