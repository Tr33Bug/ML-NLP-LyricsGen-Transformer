Bodies (Remastered Version) LyricsShe was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree
She was a no one who killed her baby
She sent the letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace!
Body
I'm not an animal
Body
I'm not an animal
Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in the lavatory
Die little baby screaming
Body
Screamin fucking bloody mess
It's not an animal
It's an abortion
Body, I'm not an animal
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy I'm not an abortion
Throbbing squirm
Gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge
I'm not a nurseing protein
I'm not a throbbing squirm
Fuck this and fuck that
Fuck it all and fuck
The fucking brat
She don't wanna baby that looks like that
I don't wanna baby that looks like that
Body
I'm not no animal
Body
An abortion

Body
I'm not an animal
An animal
I'm not an animal
I'm not an animal, an animal, an animal, an animal no no I ain't no animal
I'm not a body
I'm not an animal, an animal, an animal, an animal no no I ain't no animal
I'm not an animal
Mummy!Embed
