Bodies Lyrics
She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline, she lived in a tree
She was a no-one who killed her baby
She sent her letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace

Body, I'm not an animal
Body, I'm not an animal
Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
Die, little baby screaming
Body, screaming fucking bloody mess
Not an animal
It's an abortion

Body, I'm not an animal
Mummy, I'm not an abortion

Throbbing squirm
Gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge
I'm not a loss in protein
I'm not a throbbing squirm, ugh

Fuck this and fuck that
Fuck it all and fuck the fucking brat
She don't want a baby that looks like that
I don't want a baby that looks like that
Body, I'm not an animal
Body, an abortion
You might also like
Body, I'm not an animal
Body, I'm not an animal
An animal
I'm not an animal
I'm not an animal, an animal, I'm not an animal, I ain't no animal
I'm not a body
I'm not an animal, an animal... animal
I'm not an animal
