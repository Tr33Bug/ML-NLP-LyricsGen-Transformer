Body LyricsShe was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline, she lived in a tree
She sent her letters from the country
She was an no-one who killed her baby
She was an animal!
Body, I'm not an animal!
Body, I'm not an animal!
Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
It was killed for a minor fee
And it died!
A screaming blood body!
Not a squirm squelch
A gurgling bloody mess!
Body, I'm not an animal!
Mommy, I'm not an animal!
I'm not an animal!
I'm not an animal--ah hah!
I'm not an animal!
I ain't no animal!
Fuck this and fuck that
Fuck it all and fuck the fucking brat
She don't want a baby who looks like that
She...was an animal!
I'm not no animal!
Body! Not an animal!

Body, not an animal!
I'm not an animal!
I'm not an animal
An animal
An animal
An animal
An animal
I'm not a body!
I'm not an animal
Not an animal
An animal
I ain't no animal
I'm not an animal
Don't call me animal!
