Câ€™mon Everybody Lyrics
Well come on everybody and let's get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans
And I'm really going to spend it right
Well I've been doing my homework all week long
Now to have some fifty and my folk are gone
Ooh! Come on everybody
Well, my baby's number one
But I'm going to dance with three or four
And the house will be shaking from the bare feet
A-stamping on the floor
Well when you hear the music and you can't still
If your brother won't rock then your sister will
Ooh! Come on everybody
Well, we're really going to party
But we got to leave a guard outside
If my folks come home
I'm afraid they're going to have my hide
Well, there'd be no more movies for a week or two
No more running 'round with the usual crew - who cares?
Come on everybody!You might also likeEmbed
