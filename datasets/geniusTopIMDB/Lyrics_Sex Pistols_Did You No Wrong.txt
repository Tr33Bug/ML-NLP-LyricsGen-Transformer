Did You No Wrong Lyrics
I don't mind the things that you say
I don't even mind going out of my way
I try and do these things for you
Why should I do it I'm always untrue

Well, I did you no wrong
I did you no wrong
Going out of my head
I haven't seen you off the screen
But those films are my dreams
And I can't take much more of you
Because the bog is no place to see your face

Oh can't you see I'm out of my head
Oh can't you see I'm a little insane
Oh can't you see going out of my head
Oh can't you see I'm really dead
