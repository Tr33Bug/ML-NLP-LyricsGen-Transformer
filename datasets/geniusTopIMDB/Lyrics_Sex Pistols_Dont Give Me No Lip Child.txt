(Donâ€™t Give Me) No Lip (Child) Lyrics (x3)
Don't you give me no lip child
Don't you talk back to me
You're no lip child
That ain't the way it's going to be
If you want to love true, true loving
You'd better stop
Pushing and a-shoving, pushing and a-shoving

Don't you give me no lip child
And I mean what I say
No lip child
Or you'll be someone dead
Breaking out of my loving
You'd better stop
Pushing and a-shoving 
No more lip

Don't you give me no lip child
Don't you talk back to me
You're no lip child
That ain't the way it's going to be
If you want to love true, true loving
You'd better stop
Pushing and a-shoving, pushing and a-shoving

Don't you give me no lip child
And I mean what I say
No lip child
Or you'll be someone dead
Breaking out of my loving

You'd better stop
You'll be sorry 
No more lip
