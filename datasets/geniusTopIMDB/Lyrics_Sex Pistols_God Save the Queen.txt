God Save the Queen Lyrics
God save the Queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
Potential H-bomb
God save the Queen
She ain't no human being
There is no future
In England's dreaming

Don't be told what you want to want to
And don't be told what you want to need
There's no future, no future
No future for you
God save the Queen
We mean it, man
We love our Queen
God saves

God save the Queen
'Cause tourists are money
And our figurehead
Is not what she seems
Oh, God save history
God save your mad parade
Oh, Lord, God have mercy
All crimes are paid

When there's no future how can there be sin?
We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in your human machine
We're the future, your future

God save the Queen
We mean it, man
We love our Queen
God saves
You might also like

God save the Queen
We mean it, man
And there is no future
In England's dreaming

No future
No future
No future for you
No future
No future
No future for me
No future
No future
No future for you
No future
No future for you12Embed
