(Iâ€™m Not Your) Stepping Stone Lyrics
I I I I I'm not your stepping stone 

You're trying to make your mark in society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
You're reading about your payday in your magazines
The clothes you're wearing girl
Are causing public scenes

I I I I I'm not your stepping stone 
Not your stepping stone 

When I first met you girl you didn't had no shoes
Now you're walking 'round like you're front page news
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose
But you won't find my name in your book of Who's Who

I I I I I'm not your stepping stone 

Not your stepping stone
I'm not stone
I'm not rock
I I I I I'm not your stepping stone 
You're trying to make your mark in society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
You're reading about your payday in your magazines
The clothes you're wearing
Are causing public scenes
I I I I I'm not your stepping stone You might also likeEmbed
