Liar Lyrics
Liar, lie, lie, lie, you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Tell me why, tell me why
Why'd you have to lie?
Should've realised that you
Should've told the truth
Should've realised
You know what I'll do

You're in suspension
You're a liar
Now I wanna know
I know now I wanna know
Why you never look me in the face
Broke a confidence just to please your ego
Should've realised
You know what I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar

I know where you go, everybody you know
I know everything that you do or say
So when you tell lies I'll always be in your way
I'm nobody's fool and I know all
'Cause I know what I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

Liar, lie, lie, lie, liar, you liar, lie, lie, lie
I think you're funny, you're funny, haha
I don't need it, don't need your blah, blah
Should've realised I know what you are

You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're in suspension
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a lie, you're a liar3Embed
