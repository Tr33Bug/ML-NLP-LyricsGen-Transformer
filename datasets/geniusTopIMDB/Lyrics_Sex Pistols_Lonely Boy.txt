Lonely Boy Lyrics
I'm left in misery
The girl I love's gone across the sea
I'm all alone
I ain't got no home
Mandy was her name
Sleeping was her game
She didn't care about me
Oh God, baby can't you see

I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I need her tender touch
Oh, I need it oh so much
I can't forget
I'm so upset
I wonder where she's gone
I wonder where she went wrong
I want to get her back to me
But I think she's tired of me

I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy

Every time I think of her
It brings back memories
I remember how it used to be
Oh baby, can't you see?
Oh baby, come back to me

I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
You might also like
Oh my darling can't you see
You're the one that means so much to me
I know I need you're tender touch
Oh I need it oh so much
I can't wait to fill your crotch
Oh what a crotch
I can't wait to fuck it

I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy
I'm a lonely boy1Embed
