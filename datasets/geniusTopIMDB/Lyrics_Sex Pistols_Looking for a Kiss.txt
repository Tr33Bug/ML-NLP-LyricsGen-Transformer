Looking for a Kiss LyricsAn imitation from New York
You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk
You're hippy tarts hero
'Cause you put on a bad show, you put on a bad show
Don't it show
Still out on those pills
Do you remember
You think it's swell playing Max's Kansas
You're looking bored and acting flash
With nothing in your gut you better
Keep yer mouth shut
You better keep yer mouth shut
You're in a rut
Still out on those pills
Do you remember?
Four years on you still look the same
I think about time
You changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
Ya poor little faggot
You seal with a kiss
Do you remember?
Think it's swell playing in Japan
Everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
You poor little David
You seal it with a kiss
Still out on those pills
Condemned
Still looking for a kiss
A kiss a kiss
Looking for a kiss
Four years on and you're still the same
I think about time you changed your brain
Think about time you changed your name
You might also likeA kiss
Looking for a kiss
Looking for that kiss
Looking for the same old kissEmbed
