My Way LyricsAnd now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt, I'm not a queer
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
And each and every highway
And that, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
I've planned each charted course
Each careful step along the highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
There were times
I'm sure you knew
When there was fuck, fuck
Fuck all else to do
But through it all
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced 'em all and the world
And did it my way
I've loved and been a snide
I've had my fill, uh
My share of losing
And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think, I killed a cat
And might I say
Not in the die way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

What has he got
When he wears hats
And he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I fucked no bloke
And did it my way1Embed
