New York Lyrics
An imitation from New York
You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk
You're hippy tarts hero cos you put on bad show
You put on bad show, oh, don't it show?

Still, oh, out on those pills
Oh, do you remember?

Think it is well playing Max's Kansas
You're looking bored and you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut, you better keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut, in a rut
Still out on those pills
Do the sambo

You're four years on, you still look the same
I think about time you changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me


Think it's well playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Still out on those pills
Cheap thrills, Anadins, Aspros, anything, you're condemned
To eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me
You might also like
A kiss, a kiss, you're sealed with a kiss
A looking for a kiss, you're coming to this
I wanna kiss
You do just about anything
Oh, kiss this
