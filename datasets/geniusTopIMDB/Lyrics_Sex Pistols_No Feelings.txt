No Feelings Lyrics
I've seen you in the mirror when the story began
And I fell in love with you, I love your mortal sin
Your brains are locked away, but I love your company
I only ever leave you when you got no money
I got no emotion for anybody else
You better understand I'm in love with myself, myself
My beautiful self

I've no feeling, I've no feeling
I've no feeling for anybody else
Hello and goodbye in a runaround Sue
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head, you got nothing to say
Get out of the way cos I gotta get away
You never realise I take the piss out of you
You come up and see me and I'll beat you black and blue
All day, I'll send you away

I've got no feeling, I've no feeling
I've no feeling for anybody else
Except for myself, my beautiful selfish

There ain't no moonlight after midnight
I see you silly people out looking for delight
Well, I'm so happy, I'm feeling so fine
I'm watching all the rubbish, you're wasting my time
I look around your house, you got nothing to steal
I kick you in the brains when you get down to kneel
And pray, you pray to your god

I've no feeling, I've no feeling
I've got no feeling for anybody else
I've no feeling, I've no feeling
I've no feeling for anybody else
Except for myself
Your god has gone away
Be back another day
See his picture hanging on your wallYou might also like6Embed
