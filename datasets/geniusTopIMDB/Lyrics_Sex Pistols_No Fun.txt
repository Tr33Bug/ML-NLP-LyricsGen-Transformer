No Fun LyricsRight
Here we go now
A sociology lecture
With a bit of psychology
A bit of neurology
A bit of fuck-ology
No fun
Right, no fun
My babe, no fun
No fun
My babe, no fun
Fun to be alone
Alone and by myself
Fun to be alone
In love with nobody else
No fun
My babe, no fun
No fun
My babe, no fun
Fun to be alone
Walking by myself
Fun to be alone
In love with no friends of mine
Maybe going out or maybe stay at home
Maybe call somebody on the telephone
So come on, my baby, come on, so come on
I'm alone, having no fun by myself
This is no fun with nobody else
I'm all alone by myself
I'll be alone, nobody else
It's no fun
Oh, it's no fun all alone
All alone, no fun
All alone, no fun
All alone, no fun
All alone, no fun
No fun all alone
I'm alone
I'm alive
I'm alone
And I'm waiting to have my fun
I'm waiting, ain't got no one
I'm all alone
This is no fun
No fun
All alone, I'm alive
No fun, I'm alive
No fun, I'm alone
No fun, I'm alone
No fun, I'm alive
No fun, I'm alive
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun

Fun to be alone
Walking by myself
Fun to be alone
In love with nobody else
Maybe going out and maybe stay at home
Maybe call somebody on the telephone
So come on
I'm all alone, so come on
Oh, come and play
I'm alone, I'm alone
With nobody else
I'm alone, I'm alone
All by myself
And I want some fun with somebody else
My baby's alone on the lavatory
My baby won't come play with me
I'm alone
All alone and I'm looking at the telephone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm all alone
I got nobody else
I want my fun
I'm gonna make my own fun
All alone, I'm alive
All alone, I'm alive
All alone, I'm alive
All alone, it's no fun
All alone, I'm alive
No fun, no fun
No fun
All by myself, come on
I'm all alone so come on
I'm all alone so come on
Come play with me and I want my fun
I want someone else
I want some fun and I'm all alone
I'm all alone, no fun
It's no fun
Not funny
Not funny
It's not funny
It's no fun, it's not funny
I'm by myself, I'm aliveEmbed
