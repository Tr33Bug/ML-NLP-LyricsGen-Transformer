No Future Lyrics
God, save the queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
Potential bomb
God, save the queen
She's not human being
There is no future in England's dreaming
Don't be told what you want, don't be told what you need
No future, there's no future, no future for you
God, save the queen
God save window leen
God save human beings
God, save the queen, tourists are money
And our figure head is not what she seems
God, save history, God, save your mad parade
Lord God, have mercy, all crimes are paid
We're the flowers in the dustbin
We're the poison in your human machine
We're the future, your future
God save the queen, we mean it, man
We love our queen, God saves
God, save the queen, tourists are money
And our figure head is not what she seems
No future for you, no future for you
No future, no future for me
No future, no future for you
No future, no future for me
No future, no future for youYou might also likeEmbed
