No One Is Innocent LyricsGod save the sex pistols they're a bunch of wholesome blokes
They just like wearing filthy clothes and swapping filthy jokes
God save television keep the programmes pure
God save William Grundy from falling in manure
Ronnie Biggs was doing time until he done a bunk
Now he says he's seen the light and he sold his soul for punk
God save Martin Boorman and nazis on the run
They wasn't being wicked God, that was their idea of fun
God save Myra Hindley, God save Ian Brady
Even though he's horrible and she ain't what you call a lady
Ronnie Biggs was doing time until he done a bunk
Now he says he's seen the light and he sold his soul for punk
Ronnie Biggs was doing time until he done a bunk
Now he says he's seen the light and he sold his soul for punk
God save politicians God save our friends the pigs
God save Idi Amin and god save Ronald Biggs
God save all us sinners God save your blackest sheep
God save the good samaritan and god save the worthless creep
Ronnie Biggs was doing time until he done a bunk
Now he says he's seen the light and he sold his soul for punk
Ronnie Biggs was doing time until he done a bunk
Now he says he's seen the light and he sold his soul for punk
Sold his soul, Sold his soul, he sold his whole soul for punkYou might also likeEmbed
