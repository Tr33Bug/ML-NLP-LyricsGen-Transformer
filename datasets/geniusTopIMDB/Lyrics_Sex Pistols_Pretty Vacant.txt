Pretty Vacant Lyrics
There's no point in asking, you'll get no reply
Oh, just remember I don't decide
I got no reason, it's all too much
You'll always find us out to lunch

Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
We're vacant
Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
A vacant
Don't ask us to attend 'cause we're not all there
Oh, don't pretend 'cause I don't care
I don't believe illusions 'cause too much ain't for real
Stop your cheap comments 'cause we know what we feel

Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
We're vacant
Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
A vacant
Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
And now
And we don't care

There's no point in asking, you'll get no reply
Oh, just remember I don't decide
I got no reason, it's all too much
You'll always find me out to lunch
We're out at lunch

Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
We're vacant
Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
We're vacant
Oh, we're so pretty, oh, so pretty
And now
And we don't care

We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
And we don't care5Embed
