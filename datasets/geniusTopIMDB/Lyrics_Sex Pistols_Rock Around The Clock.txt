Rock Around The Clock Lyrics
One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock, rock
Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, rock
We're going to rock around the clock tonight

Put your glad rags on and join me, hon
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one

We're going to rock around the clock tonight
We're going to rock, rock, rock, 'til broad daylight
We're going to rock, going to rock, around the clock tonight
When the clock strikes two, three and four
If the band slows down we'll yell for more


When the chimes ring five, six and seven
We'll be right in seventh heaven


When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too
I'll be going strong and so will you


When the clock strikes twelve, we'll cool off then
Start a rocking round the clock again
