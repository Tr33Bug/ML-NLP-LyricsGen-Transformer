Satellite Lyrics
Suburban kid, you got no name
Two ton(e) baby and you got no brain
I bet you're only happy in suburbian dreams
But I'm only laughing cause you aren't in my scheme

Hey baby
I love you
I love you
I love you
I only ever listen when you're on the phone
From your safety where you sit at home
When I got nothing better to do
Then there is always you
Because you're good for my shoe

Hey babe
I love you
I love you
I love you

I'm in love
Yeah in love
Oh, can't you feel it?
No I don't like where you come from
It's just a satellite of London
And when you look me in the eye
Just remember that I want to die

Hey babe
I love you
I love you
I love you
You might also like
You're the name but you can't tell
Looking like you just came out to hell
How did you figure that'd you'd any use?
All you're going to get is my abuse
