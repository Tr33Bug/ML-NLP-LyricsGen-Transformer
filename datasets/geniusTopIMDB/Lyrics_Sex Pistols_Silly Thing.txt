Silly Thing Lyrics
What you see, you can't get
Nothing's free, nothing's set
Don't be fooled by the signs
Don't read in between the lines

What you're going to say?
What you're going to do?
Now you've missed out once again
But I thought you knew
Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...
Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...

Trouble here, trouble there
People stop just to stare
What's the use of wasting time?
Just move on, leave 'em all behind

What you're going to say?
What you're going to do?
Now you've missed out once again
But I thought you knew

Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...
Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...

Oh, you, silly thing
Nothing but trouble that you bring
One of these days you're gonna die
And people will say, "Oh, my, oh my!"
And people will say, "Oh, my, my, my, my!"
You might also like
Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...
Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...
Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...
Oh, you silly thing!
You've really gone and done it now...1Embed
