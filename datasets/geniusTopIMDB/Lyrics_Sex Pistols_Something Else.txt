Something Else Lyrics
Look at that
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One of the cutest since I don't know when
But she don't notice me when I pass
She goes with all the guys from out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinking to myself
She's sure fine looking, man, she's something else
Look at that
Across the street
There's a car built just for me
To own a car would be a luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinking to myself
That car's fine looking, man, it's something else
Hey, look at that
Just wait and see
Worked hard and saved my dough
I buy that car and then I roll up with Joe
Get me that girl and we go riding around
We look real sharp with the wide top down
I keep on dreaming and thinking to myself
When it all comes true, wow man, that's something else
Hey, look at that
What's all this?
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I'm a-knocking on her door
My car's out front and it's all mine
It's a '41 job not a '59
I got that girl and I'm thinking to myself
She's sure fine looking, man, wow, she's something elseYou might also likeEmbed
