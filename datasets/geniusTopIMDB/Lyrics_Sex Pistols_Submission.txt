Submission Lyrics
I'm on a submarine mission for you, baby
I feel the way you were going
I picked you up on our TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing

Submission
Going down, down, dragging her down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found
You've got me pretty deep, baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in Heaven above

Submission
Going down, down, dragging me down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found

For there's a mystery
Under the sea, underwater
Come share it

Submission
Going down, down, dragging her down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found

Cos it's a secret
Under the water, under the sea

Got me pretty deep, baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in Heaven above

Submission
Going down, down, you're dragging her down
Submission
I can't tell ya what I've found

Submission
Submission
Going down, down, under the sea
I wanna drown, drown, under the water
Going down, down, under the sea10Embed
