Substitute LyricsYou don't need premission for anything
You think that we look pretty good together
And you think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah
Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit was made out of sack
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by
Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white but my dad was black
My fine looking suit was made out of sack

Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white but my dad was black
My fine looking suit was made out of sack
Substitue
I'm substitute
