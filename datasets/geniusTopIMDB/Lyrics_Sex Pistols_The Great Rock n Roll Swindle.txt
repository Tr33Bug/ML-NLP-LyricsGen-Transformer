The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle Lyrics
People said we couldn't play
They called us foul-mouthed yobs
But the only notes that really count
Are the ones that come in wads
They all drowned when the air turned blue
Cause we didn't give a toss
Filthy lucre, isn't nothing new
But we all get cash from the chaos

The time is right to do it now
The greatest rock and roll swindle
The time is right to do it now
E.M.I. said you are out of hand
And they gave us the boot
But they couldn't sack us, just like that
Without giving us the loot
Thank you kindly A & M
They said we were out of bounds
But that isn't bad for two weeks work
And 75,000 pounds
 

I just want to play with my band
Are you good enough for me
Hiya boys I'm the chosen one
Can't you fucking see
I'm a jealous god and I want everything
And I love you with a knife
I'll take you, if you're ready for me
And I'll give you my life


The time is right for Nickey's Special
The greatest rock and roll star
The time is right for me now
I kill
Elvis Presley died in 1959
Chuck Berry you're a big ugly fucker
Ian Dury Cockney Fraud
Mick Jagger white nigga
Bob Dylan got a parking ticket stuck to his arsehole
David Bowie you are a bloody cunt
Malcolm Mc
Rod Stewart‘s got a luggage label tied to his tonsils
Elton John hair transplant
Sid Vicious Rock and Roll Cliché
Paul Cook bare bones
Johnny Rotten-ah his days are even numbered
Rock and roll swindle
Swindle
It's a swindle!You might also like1Embed
