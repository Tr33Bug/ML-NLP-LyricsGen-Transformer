A Most Peculiar Man Lyrics
"He was a most peculiar man"
That’s what Mrs. Riordan says
And she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man

He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone
Within a house
Within a room
Within himself
A most peculiar man
He had no friends
He seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
‘Cause he wasn’t friendly and he didn’t care
And he wasn’t like them
Oh no, he was a most peculiar man

He died last Saturday
He turned on the gas
And he went to sleep
With the windows closed
So he’d never wake up
To his silent world
And his tiny room
And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon

And all the people said
“What a shame that he’s dead
But wasn’t he a most peculiar man?”You might also like2Embed
