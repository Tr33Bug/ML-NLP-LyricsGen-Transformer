A Simple Desultory Philippic (Or How I Was Robert McNamaraâ€™d into Submission) Lyrics
I been Norman Mailered, Maxwell Taylored
I been John O'Hara'd, McNamara'd
I been Rolling Stoned and Beatled 'til I'm blind
I been Ayn Randed, nearly branded
Communist, cause I'm left-handed
That's the hand I use... well, never mind

I been Phil Spectored, resurrected
I been Lou Adlered, Barry Sadlered
Well, I paid all the dues I want to pay
And I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce
And all of my wealth won't buy me health
So I smoke a pint of tea a day
I knew a man, his brain so small
He couldn't think of nothing at all
Not the same as you and me
He doesn't dig poetry
He's so unhip when you say Dylan
He thinks you're talking about Dylan Thomas
Whoever he was
The man ain't got no culture
But it's alright, Ma
Everybody must get stoned

I been Mick Jaggered, been silver daggered
Andy Warhol, won't you please come home?
I been mothered, fathered, aunt and uncled
Been Roy Haleed and Art Garfunkeled
I just discovered somebody's tapped my phone

(Folk rock...)
