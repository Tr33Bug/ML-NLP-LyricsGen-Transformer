Blues Run the Game LyricsCatch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game
Send out for whiskey, baby
Send out for gin
Me and room service, honey
Me and room service, babe
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin
When I ain't drinking, baby
You are on my mind
When I ain't sleeping, honey
When I ain't sleeping, Mama
When I ain't sleeping
Well, you know you find me cryin'
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game
Living is a gamble, baby
Loving's much the same
Wherever I have played
Wherever I throw those dice
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game
Maybe when I'm older, baby
Someplace down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older, Mama
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my tryin'

Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same1Embed
