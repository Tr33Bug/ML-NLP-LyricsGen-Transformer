Cecilia Lyrics
'Cilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
'Cilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home
Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom (making love)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someone's taken my place

'Cilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
(Take it up, take it up)
(Take it up, take it up)

Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and die laughing
Jubilation, she loves me again
I fall on the floor and die laughing
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-ohYou might also like7Embed
