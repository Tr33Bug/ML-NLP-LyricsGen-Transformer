Keep the Customer Satisfied Lyrics
Gee, but it’s great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
I’ve been on the road so long, my friend
And if you came along
I know you couldn’t disagree

It’s the same old story, yeah
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I’m one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied
Deputy Sheriff said to me
“Tell me what you come here for, boy
You better get your bags and flee
You’re in trouble, boy
And now you’re heading into more”

It’s the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I’m one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied

And it’s the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered, libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And I’m so tired
I’m oh, so tired
But I’m trying to keep my customers satisfied
