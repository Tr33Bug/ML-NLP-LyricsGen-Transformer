Leaves That Are Green Lyrics
I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song
I’m twenty-two now but I won’t be for long
Time hurries on

And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand

Once my heart was filled with love of a girl
I held her close but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write
And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand

I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound

And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
That’s all there is

And the leaves that are green turn to brownYou might also likeEmbed
