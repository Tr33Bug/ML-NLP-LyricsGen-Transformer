My Little Town Lyrics
In my little town
I grew up believing
God keeps His eye on us all
And He used to lean upon me
As I pledged allegiance to the wall
Lord I recall
My little town

Coming home after school
Flying my bike past the gates
Of the factories
My mom doing the laundry
Hanging our shirts
In the dirty breeze
And after it rains
There's a rainbow
And all of the colors are black
It's not that the colors aren't there
It's just imagination they lack
Everything's the same

Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town

I never meant nothing
I was Just my father's son
Saving my money
Dreaming of glory
Twitching like a finger
On the trigger of a gun
Leaving nothing but the dead and dying

Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying
Back in my little townYou might also likeEmbed
