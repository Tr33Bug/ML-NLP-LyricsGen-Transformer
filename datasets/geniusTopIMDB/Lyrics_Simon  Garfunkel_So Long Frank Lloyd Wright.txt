So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright Lyrics
So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
I can't believe your song is gone so soon
I barely learned the tune
So soon
So soon

I'll remember Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long
Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view
When I run dry
I stop awhile and think of you
Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view

So long, Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
("So long already, Artie!")
So long
