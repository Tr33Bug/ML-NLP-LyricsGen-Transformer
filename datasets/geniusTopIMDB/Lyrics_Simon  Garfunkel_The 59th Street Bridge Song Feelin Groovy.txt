The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelinâ€™ Groovy) Lyrics
Slow down, you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da ... feelin' groovy

Hello, lamppost, whatcha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in' doo-doo, feelin' groovy
Ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da ... feelin' groovy
I've got no deeds to do, no promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you
All is groovyYou might also like3Embed
