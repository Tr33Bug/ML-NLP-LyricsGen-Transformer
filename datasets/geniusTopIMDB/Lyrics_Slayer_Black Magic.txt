Black Magic Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cursed, black magic night
We've been struck down
Down in this Hell
Spells surround me day and night
Stricken by the force of evil light
The force of evil light

[Verse 2]
Cast under his spell
Blinding my eyes
Twisting my mind
Fight to resist the evil inside
Captive of a force of Satan's might
A force of Satan's might
[Chorus]
Fighting the curse
Break it, I must
Laughing in sorrow
Crying in lust

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Outro]
My strength slips fast
Soon, I must fall
Victim of fortune
My sources grow small
Life slips away
As demons come forth
Death takes my hand
And captures my soul
