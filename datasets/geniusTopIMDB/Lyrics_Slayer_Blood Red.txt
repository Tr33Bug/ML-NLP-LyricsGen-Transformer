Blood Red Lyrics[Verse 1]
Peaceful confrontation, meet war machine
Seizing all civil liberties
Honest ballotation among banshee
Spilling blood on humanity

[Chorus]
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
The massacre of innocent people
[Verse 2]
Deviated lies, fear blinds your eyes
Enforcing their truth through a gun
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Thousands of people cannot be wrong

[Chorus]
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
Stains the primitive sickle
Blood red

[Verse 3]
Growing opposition with words as ammunition
Expressions of life's liberties
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Spilling blood throughout humanity

[Chorus]
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
Stains the primitive sickle
Blood redYou might also like1Embed
