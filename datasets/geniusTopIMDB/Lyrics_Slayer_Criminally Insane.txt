Criminally Insane Lyrics[Produced by Rick Rubin]
[Intro]

[Chorus]
Night will come, and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you follow

[Verse 1]
Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read, for life, I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave
To try again, I'd have no other way
[Verse 2]
Quarters for the criminally insane
Escape, for me, has fast become a game
Soon to be, I'll leave without a trace
Endangered species, end the human race

[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Bridge]
Branded in pain, marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation, but what have I done
I have yet only just begun
To take your fuckin' lives!

[Chorus]
Night will come, and I will follow
For my victims, no tomorrow
Make it fast, your time of sorrow
On his trail, I'll make you followYou might also like2Embed
