Cult Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oppression is the holy law
In God I distrust
In time, His monuments will fall
Like ashes to dust
Is war and greed the master plan?
The Bible's where it all began
Its propaganda sells despair
And spreads the virus everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore
[Chorus 1]
The pestilence is Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice: Six-six-six

[Lead – Hanneman]

[Verse 2]
Corruption breeds the pedophile
Don't pray for the priest
Confession finds the lonely child
God preys on the weak
You think your soul can still be saved
I think you're fuckin' miles away
Scream out loud, here's where you begin:
"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned"

[Pre-Chorus]
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore
You might also like[Chorus 2]
The target's fucking Jesus Christ
I would've led the sacrifice
And nailed him to the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice: Six-six-six

[Bridge]
Jesus is pain
Jesus is gore
Jesus is the blood
That's spilled in war
He's everything
He's all things dead
He's pulling on the trigger
Pointed at your head

Through fear, you're sold into the fraud
Revelation, revolution
I see through your Christ illusion

[Lead – King]

[Verse 3]
The war on terror just drags along
My war with God is growing strong
His propaganda sells despair
And spreads the violence everywhere
[Pre-Chorus]
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religion's obscene
Religion's a whore

[Chorus 3]
There is no fuckin' Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
I've made my choice: Six-six-six

[Lead – Hanneman]4Embed
