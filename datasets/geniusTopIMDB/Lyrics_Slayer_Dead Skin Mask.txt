Dead Skin Mask Lyrics[Intro]
How I've waited for you to come
I've been here all alone
Now that you've arrived
Please stay awhile
And I promise I won't keep you long
I'll keep you forever (Forever, forever, forever)

[Verse 1]
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead, cold flesh appease the means
Provoking images, delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon
[Chorus]
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control

[Verse 2]
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants

[Bridge]
In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same

[Guitar Solos: Kerry King & Jeff Hanneman]

[Verse 3]
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead, warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me

[Verse 2]
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants

Dance with the dead in my dreams (Hello? Hello, Mr. Gein?)
Listen to their hallowed screams (Mr. Gein?)
The dead have taken my soul (Let me out of here, Mr. Gein)
Temptation's lost all control (Mr. Gein? I don't want to play anymore, Mr. Gein)
Dance with the dead in my dreams (Mr. Gein, this isn't fun anymore)
Listen to their hallowed screams (I don't wanna play anymore, Mr. Gein)
The dead have taken my soul (Mr. Gein? I want out of here, Mr. Gein)
Temptation's lost all control (Let me out now!)10Embed
