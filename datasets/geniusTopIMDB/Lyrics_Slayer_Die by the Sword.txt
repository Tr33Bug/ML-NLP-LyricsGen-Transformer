Die by the Sword Lyrics[Verse 1]
Live by the sword and help to contain
The helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood
Clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
Children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve
Only the words of the Lord

[Chorus]
Die by the sword
Die by the sword
[Verse 2]
Satan watches all of us
Smiles as some do his bidding
Try to escape the grasp of my hand
And your life will no longer exist
Hear our cry, save us from
The Hell in which we live
We turn our heads toward the sky
And listen for the steel

[Chorus]
Die by the sword
Die by the sword

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

[Bridge]
Watch as flowers decay
On the cryptic life that died
The wisdom of the wizards
Is only a nurtured lie
Black knights of Hell's domain
Walk upon the dead
Satanas sips upon
The blood on which he feeds
Hahahahaha
