Disciple Lyrics[Produced by Matt Hyde]

[Verse 1]
Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
I'll instigate, I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time

[Hook]
God hates us all, God hates us all
You know it's true, God hates this place
You know it's true, He hates this race
[Verse 2]
Homicide, suicide
Hate heals, you should try it sometime
Strive for peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
I know why your prayers will never be answered

[Hook]
God hates us all, God hates us all
God hates us all, God hates us all
Yeah, he fuckin' hates me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Cutthroat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back, fair game
Drug abuse, self-abuse, searching for the next high
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

[Refrain]
I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow
You might also like[Verse 4]
Man-made virus infecting the world
Self-destruct, human time bomb
What if there is no God? Would you think the fucking same?
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
Wake the fuck up, can't ignore what I say
I got my own philosophy
I hate everyone equally
You can't tear that out of me
No segregation, separation
Just me in my world of enemies

[Refrain]
I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow
I'll never be the one to bear the cross
Disciple

[Outro]
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place
I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place10Embed
