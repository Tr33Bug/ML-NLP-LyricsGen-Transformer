Evil Has No Boundaries Lyrics[Intro: Tom Araya]
Ah!

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Verse 1: Tom Araya]
Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem, the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer, then move on ahead
[Chorus: Gene Hoglan & Tom Araya]
Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds

[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

[Verse 2: Tom Araya]
Satan, our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon, there'll be nothing else left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angels and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

[Chorus: Gene Hoglan & Tom Araya]
Evil
Aah, haha
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds
