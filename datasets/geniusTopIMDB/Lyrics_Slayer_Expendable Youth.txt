Expendable Youth Lyrics[Verse 1]
Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf, my battlefield
In no one's way, caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill

[Chorus]
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution
[Verse 2]
Injured soul on the hard ground
Head blown off, facedown
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death, homicide

[Chorus]
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution

[Instrumental Break]
Try and take me, you motherfucker!

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

[Bridge]
Struggling to survive
This drug-induced warfare
Having control
A principal obsession
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend
You might also like[Chorus]
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death: the only solution1Embed
