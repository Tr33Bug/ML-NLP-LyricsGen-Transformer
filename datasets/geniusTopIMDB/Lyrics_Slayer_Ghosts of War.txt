Ghosts of War Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fate, silent warriors, sleeping souls will rise
Once forgotten soldiers come to life
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done
Not content with wars we've never won

[Chorus]
Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Rise, ghosts of war
[Verse 2]
Target, assassinate, time of your life has expired
Hatred, victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die
Violence, inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie

[Chorus]
Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Rise, ghosts of war

[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Bridge]
I deal in pain
All life, I drain
I dominate
I seal your fate

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I deal in pain
All life, I drain
Memories can't ignore
Rise, ghost of warYou might also likeEmbed
