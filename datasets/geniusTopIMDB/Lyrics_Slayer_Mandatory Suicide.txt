Mandatory Suicide Lyrics[Verse 1]
Murder at your every footstep
A child's toy, sudden death
Sniper blazes you through your knees
Falling down, can you feel the heat?
Burn!

[Verse 2]
Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head
Offspring sent out to cry
Living mandatory suicide
[Chorus]
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Verse 3]
Holes burn deep in your chest
Raked by machine gun fire
Screaming soul sent out to die
Living mandatory suicide

[Chorus]
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide

[Outro]
Lying, dying, screaming in pain
Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain
Mines explode, pain shears through your brain
Radical amputation, this is insane
Flyswatter stakes drive through your chest
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath
A vile smell, like tasting death
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit
Dying in terror
Blood's cheap, it's everywhere
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line
