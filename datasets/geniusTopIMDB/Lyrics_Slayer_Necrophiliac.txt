Necrophiliac Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mortuaries, dead of night
My body starts to rise
In my mind, the horror lives
To feel death deep inside
Relentless lust of rotting flesh
To thrash the tomb she lies
Heathen whore of Satan's wrath
I spit at your demise

[Bridge 1]
Virgin child, now drained of life
Your soul cannot be free
Not given the chance to rot in Hell
[Verse 2]
Satan's cross points to Hell
The Earth, I must uncover
A passion grows to feast upon
The frozen blood inside her
I feel the urge, the growing need
To fuck the sinful corpse
My task complete, the bitch's soul
Lies raped in demonic lust

[Lead: King]

[Verse 3]
Her stomach bursts, the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown
Hungry for the smell of death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die

[Bridge]
Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul
You might also like[Outro]
Down to the fiery pits of Hell
Down to the fiery pits of
Hell
