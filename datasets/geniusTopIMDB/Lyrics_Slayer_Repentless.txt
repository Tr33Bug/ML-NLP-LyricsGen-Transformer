Repentless Lyrics[Verse 1]
Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckin' day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see

[Chorus]
Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride
[Verse 2]
My songs relive the atrocities of war
Can't take society any fuckin' more
Intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
Playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
I leave it all on the road, living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it every day
So take your shot, bottom's up, this is no lie
I'll be beating this guitar till the day I die

[Chorus]
Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

[Verse 3]
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fuckin' scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin' do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
We're killing ourselves a little more every day

[Chorus]
Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it rideYou might also like6Embed
