Threshold Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't want to see, I don't want to hear
I don't want to feel anything, can't you understand?
Everything I do doesn't stem from you
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die, throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that spews from me
Take it
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't control the rage that flows from me
I can't shut it down; it overwhelms me
I can't stop the rage that flows from me

[Chorus]
Can't stop the
Violence, I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious, I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate, there is no other way
It's my discipline, it's my way of life

[Verse 2]
Never wanted bliss, never wanted you
Never needed anyone, I've polluted
Everything you feel, everything you are
Everything you'll ever be; you repulse me
It's always about you, you always come at me
With shit I can't identify, you know it makes me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take it
You might also like[Chorus]
Can't stop the
Violence, I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious, I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate, there is no other way
It's my discipline, it's my way of life
Yeah!

[Outro]
I can't stop the rage
I can't stop to hate you
I can't control the violence2Embed
