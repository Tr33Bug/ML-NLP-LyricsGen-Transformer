A Fork in the Road Lyrics
(Beware) Beware
(Beware) The danger's there
(Beware) Beware

Seems like love should be easier to bear
But it's such a heavy load
Worldwide travelers, you ain't been nowhere
'Till you've traveled down love's road
Although I may be just a stranger
Lovers, let me warn you there's the danger
Of a fork in love's road

(Beware) Beware
(Beware) The danger's there
(Beware) Ho, ho, ho

One way is for those who go alone
That way tempts the fool like me
Oh, but lovers don't try to make it on your own
You don't want this misery

Oh, oh, why didn't I see the sign
Ooh, ooh, before I left my love behind
At the fork in love's road

(Beware) Beware
(Beware) The danger's there
(Beware) Ho, ho, ho
You might also like
If there is something that you don't see eye to eye
You better think before you tell your love goodbye
'Cause your paths may never cross again
Ooh, make sure you take the same bend
At the fork in love's road

(Beware) Beware
(Beware) The danger's there
(Beware) If you really care
(Beware) Ooh, oh, oh
(Beware) Beware
(Beware)Embed
