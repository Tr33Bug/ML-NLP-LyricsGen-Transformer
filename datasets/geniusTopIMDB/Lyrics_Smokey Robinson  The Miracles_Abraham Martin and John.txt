Abraham, Martin and John Lyrics
Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone

Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone
Has anybody here seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lotta people, but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and he's gone

Didn't you love the things they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good in you and me?
And we'll be free
Someday soon it's gonna be one day

Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill
