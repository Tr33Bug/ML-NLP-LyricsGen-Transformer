After You Put Back the Pieces (Iâ€™ll Still Have a Broken Heart) LyricsYes, you played the part of my true lover
But then you broke my heart
Now you'll try in vain to kiss back a dream
That no longer remains
'Cause I'm tired it's true
Of what I'm going through
It's better if we're apart
After you put back the pieces
I'll still have a broken heart
In playing your games
You broke every promise
And then the heartaches came to us
Although you're tellin' me
That you're so sorry
Then you hurt me from the start
After you put back the pieces
I'll still have a broken heart
Oh, yes I will
If my love you miss
Then always remember
That you started this
For a heart that is real
If once it is broken
It may never heal
For breaking hearts with you
Is nothing new
With you it's just an art, I know
After you put back the pieces
I'll still have a broken heart
I know for real

And I'll still have a broken heart
I know, I know, I know, I know
After you put back the pieces
I'll still have a broken heartEmbed
