All Thatâ€™s Good LyricsSay all that's good (All that's good)
Say all that's good (All that's good)
Your lovin' wakes me up just like a cup of coffee
And when the gloom is on, you take it off me
I walk you to your door and then you kiss me
Before I go a block, you say you miss me
And all that's good (All that's good)
All that's good (All that's good)
So good until I'm crazy about it
Can't do without it
Don't even think I could
Ooh, all that's good (All that's good)
Baby, all that's good (All that's good)
You'll do anything you can to show you love me
Everything to show you're thinking of me
You'll leave a little note where I can find it
Do everything you can so I'm reminded
That all that's good (All that's good)
All that's good (All that's good)
So good until I'm crazy about it
Can't do without it
Don't even think I could
Ah yeah, all that's good (All that's good)
All that's good (All that's good)
Let me hear you blow your horn, alright
All that's good
All that's good
All that's good
Don't you know that if Romeo and you have met
There never would have been a Juliet?
A beauty like yours is so rare
Even Mona Lisa can't compare
And all that's good (All that's good)
All that's good (All that's good)
So good until I'm crazy about it, I can't do without it
Don't even think I could
Oh yeah, all that's good (All that's good)
Oh baby, all that's good (All that's good)
Each and every thing about you (All that's good)
To know that I could never do without you (All that's good)
Everything you do and say (All that's good)
Every time you look my way (All that's good)
Oh, all that's good (All that's good)You might also likeEmbed
