Choosey Beggar Lyrics
(Ooh)
Ah, yeah
(Ooh)

Beggars can't be choicey I know
That's what the people say (People say)
But though my heart is begging for love
I've turned some love away (Love away)
Oh, maybe one was true love
I'll never know which cause
Your love is the only love to make this beggar rich

I'm a choosey beggar (choosey beggar)
And you're my choice baby (You're my choice)

People say you can't have your cake
And then eat it too (Eat it too)
They tell me I've been making a mistake
Waiting around for you (Around for you)

Oh, I'm begging for love but
Why can't they see that yours is the only love for me

'Cause I'm a choosey beggar, choosey beggar (Choosey beggar, choosey beggar)
And you're my choice, baby (You're my choice)

Say it one more time now (You're my choice)
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (You're my choice)
You might also like
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
If beg you I must, then I'll never give up 'cause
Your love is the only thing to fill this beggar's cup
I'm a choosey beggar (Choosey beggar, choosey beggar)
And your my choice, oh baby (You're my choice)
When I need someone to hold me (You're my choice)
When I need arms to unfold me (You're my choice)
When I need someone beside me (You're my choice)Embed
