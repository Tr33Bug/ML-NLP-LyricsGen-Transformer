(Come ’Round Here) I’m the One You Need Lyrics
Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
And you just sit there in a daze reminiscing
When you know some other lips he's been kissing
Now when you need the love he's never shown you, come 'round here
And when you need some loving arms to hold you, come 'round here
Now I may not be the one you want, oh
But I know I'm the one you need, said I
May not be the one you want, ooh
But I know I'm the one you need
Your life stands still the minute he goes
You count the hours just hoping he shows
Girl, can't you see while you're longing for his touch
That I'm the one who loves you so much
And while you're longing for his embrace
You're alone there with tears on your face

Now when you feel the need to cry to someone, cry to me
And when you feel the need to lean on someone lean, on me
Now I may not be the one you want, oh
But I sure 'nuff the one you need, oh, baby
I may not be the one you want, ooh
But I know I'm the one you need

Now the days, the days you sit alone by yourself
He's out fooling 'round with somebody else
And leaving you alone here with nothing to do
And just waiting 'til he has time for you

Now when the loneliness gets hard to bear, girl, come 'round here
And when you need a little tender loving care, girl, come 'round here
Now I may not be the one you want, ooh
But I know I'm the one you need, ooh, I said
I may not be the one you wantYou might also likeEmbed
