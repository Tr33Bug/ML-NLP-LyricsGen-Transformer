Come Spy With Me Lyrics
Come spy with me
Live a life of danger and of mystery
You'll never trust a stranger in our company
We'll only trust each other, yes and
Secretly, secretly
I'll give you all the love desire
'Love' will be our secret spy word

Come spy with me
We can share intrigue of all variety
What a pair of secret agents we can be
You'll be there beside me as I'm
Secretly, secretly
Your kiss will make my heart beat faster
'Love' will be our secret password
We can work by the code of love
Please accept my invitation
Come on, spy with me
We'll be a brand new spy sensation
Come spy with me

Come spy with me
Come spy with me
We can share intrigue of all variety
What a pair of secret agents we can be
You'll be there beside me as I'm
Secretly, secretly
I'll give you all the love desire
'Love' will be our secret spy word
Come spy with me, spy with me
