Give Her Up LyricsGive her up
Go and give the girl up cause she'll only hurt you
Take your love like she did mine
And then she'll desert you well
Walk away and leave your heart in pain
Walk away and leave you to go insane
She's unfaithful, yeah
You could do everything you can for her
Still, she's gonna leave you cause she's ungrateful
How can I convince you she's gonna leave you on the shelf
And that she'll never love anybody
She will never love anybody
She will never love anybody but herself
So, give her up
You'd better give her up cause
She just won't do right
Let her go, you'd better let go cause
She won't treat you right
Don't you know you'll go to her one day
Don't you know she'll turn and walk away
She's untrue, untrue, untrue
On second thought, oh
Don't give her up
Cause I know I'll take her back
Whenever you give her up
Even though she's done me wrong
Cause I know the girl's all alone
I'll take her back, I'll take her backYou might also likeEmbed
