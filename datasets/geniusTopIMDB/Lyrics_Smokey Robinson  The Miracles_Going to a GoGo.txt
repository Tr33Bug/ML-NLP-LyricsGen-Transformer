Going to a Go-Go LyricsGoin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Na na na na, yeah
Well, there's a brand new place I've found
Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere
And if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town
Goin' to a go-go
(Everybody's)
Goin' to a go-go
(Come on now)
Don't you want to go
(Yeah)
One more time, yeah
I'm goin' to a go-go
(Ooh, ooh, whee)
Goin' to a go-go
(Baby, come on now)
It doesn't matter where you are
A go-go can't be far
You'll see the people from your block
And don't be shocked
If you see your favorite star
Goin' to a go-go
('Cause everybody's)
Goin' to a go-go
(Oh, come on now)
Don't you want to go
(Yeah, people, come on)
Na na na na, yeah
Tell me, don't you want to go
Yeah, now, it's all right
I'm goin' to a go-go
Yes I am
Goin' to a go-go
Oh, come on now
