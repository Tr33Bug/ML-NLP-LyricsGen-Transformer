Here I Go Again Lyrics
Saw you there and your laughter seemed to fill the air
A scent like perfume from your lovely hair
I said that I do adore

My heart said to me, don't walk head on into misery
Hey, with your eyes wide open can't you see?
A hurt's in store just like before

Oh ho ho, but here I go again walking into love
Here I go again never thinking of
The danger that might exist
Disregarding all of this just for you
I ignore the detour sign
I won't stop until you're mine
I'm past the point of no return

Girl, you walk by and I said to me, myself and I
Now we've got to give it one more try
I know somehow the time is now, right now

Oh whoa, here I go again walking into love
Here I go again walking into love
Here I go, here I go
Here I go, here I go againYou might also likeEmbed
