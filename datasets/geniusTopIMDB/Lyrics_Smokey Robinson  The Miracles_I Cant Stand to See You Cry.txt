I Canâ€™t Stand to See You Cry Lyrics
Your love is so precious and rarely found (Mmm)
I realize there are few with your love around
Oh

Oh, I see many guys taking advantage of you
They misuse your kindness as a weakness too
No longer can I stand back and watch your life fill with pain
I've seen it too many times
Tryin' to smile and keep the tears restrained
And baby, I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
'Cause your love is so precious and rarely found
I realize there are few with your love around
Oh

Oh, I'll share the blame for the hurt you have endured
I hate myself for silent lips that held words that could've been your cure
So now I'd like to step right in, please invest your love in me
And my reward for your faith will be the joy in your eyes I see

'Cause baby, I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
Your love is so precious and rarely found, baby
(Your love, so precious and rare, baby)
I realize there are few with your love around
Oh (Ooh, yeah, yeah)

Ooh
Now, now, n-now, now, now

I'm gonna be full of a love for life that's true, baby
'Cause that's how serious I am in wanting you
So place your love and trust in these hands of mine
And I'm gonna wrap our hearts as one
And together, happiness we'll find
You might also like
'Cause baby, I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
Your love is so precious and rarely found
(Your love, so rarely found, baby)
I realize there are few with your love around
Ooh, I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
Your love is so precious and rarely found, ooh, baby
I realize there are few with your love around
I can't, I can't, I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much, that's why
Your love is so precious and rarely found (Ooh, rarely found, baby)
I realize there are few with your loveEmbed
