I Care About Detroit Lyrics
There are many reasons why one cares about a city
Why you care about its problems, its people, and indeed its very future
Is it friendly, warm, hospitable and are there good job opportunities, educational facilities and a cultural centre?
Are you proud to call it your hometown?
When you come right down to it I bet you'll all agree to a resounding yes when you're talking about Detroit, my hometown

That's why I care about Detroit
Yes I'm proud to call this city my hometown
It's been good to you and me
Let's learn to live and work in harmony
Yes I care about Detroit
There's so much important work still to be done
Let's not lose all the gains that we've won
And the first place to start you must feel in your heart
We should all pull together as one

(I care about Detroit) Ooh
(And I'm proud to call this city my hometown) Ooh
(Ooh ooh) Ooh ooh
And I'm proud to call this city my hometown (my hometown)
It's been good to you and me
Let's learn to live and work in harmony
Oh I care about Detroit, ooh
I care about Detroit (I care about Detroit)
Care about Detroit (I care about Detroit)
Ooh about Detroit now (I care about Detroit)
Care about Detroit (I care about Detroit)
