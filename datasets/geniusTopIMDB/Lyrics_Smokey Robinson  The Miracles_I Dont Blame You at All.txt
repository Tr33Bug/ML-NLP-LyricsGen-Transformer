I Donâ€™t Blame You at All Lyrics
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No, no, no, no, no

I'm only payin' the price for a trip I took to paradise
'Cause I looked into a pair of eyes
And what I thought was the look of love
Was only hurt in disguise
Too bad I didn't realize, oh but don't apologize, no, 'cause
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No, no, no, no, no

I think it's pretty plain: holdin' you would take a ball & chain
Every bet I made was all in vain
'Cause what I thought was an ocean of love was just a wee drop of rain
Too bad that it couldn't rain, oh but you don't have to explain, no, 'cause

I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No, no, no, no, no
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
That's the thing to do
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No, no, no, no, no

I said, what I thought was sure to last, to last was just a minute instead
Too bad that I got misled, ah but you don't have to hang your head, no, 'cause
You might also like
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
I should've did it myself
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No, no, no, no, no
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
'Cause that's the thing to do
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No, no, no, no, noEmbed
