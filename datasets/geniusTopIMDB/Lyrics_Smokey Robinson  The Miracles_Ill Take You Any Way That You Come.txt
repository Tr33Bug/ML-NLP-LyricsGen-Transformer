I’ll Take You Any Way That You Come LyricsSince I saw you last there's been many a sunset
And every day we're apart seems like a week
Oh, but I knew you belonged to him when we first met
I know that maybe next time I see you we might not be able to speak
It's alright (It's alright), It's alright (It's alright)
If you don't come to me every night
It's ok baby (It's ok), It's Ok (It's OK)
If I don't hear from you everyday
Cause I want you and I'm willing to
Take you any way that you come
All of your loving, some of the time
Some of your loving, all of the time
Just as long as I get some
Whoa, yeah, yeah, mhmm
It's too bad, it's too bad
If loving you is gonna make me sad
Cause it's too late woman, it's too late
Till you come all I can do is wait
Yes I'll be waiting anxiously
To take you any way that you come
I know he's there and I have to share
But I'll take any time you can spare
Just as long as I get some
Oooh baby, baby, baby, baby
Oooh baby, baby, baby, baby
It's too much, it's too much
What we go through trying to keep in touch
But it's so true woman, it's so true
I'd go through anything to be with you
It may take a while, but you know I'll
Take you any way that you come
The clock strikes 1, and you gotta run
But part of your loving is better than none
Just as long as I get some
You might also likeOh it's alright, alright
If you don't come to me every night
Baby it's ok now, it's ok
If i don't hear from you every day
It's too bad woman, it's too bad
If loving you's gonna make me sadEmbed
