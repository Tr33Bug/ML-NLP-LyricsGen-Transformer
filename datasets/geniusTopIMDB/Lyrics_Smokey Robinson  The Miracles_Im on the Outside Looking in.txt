Iâ€™m on the Outside (Looking in) Lyrics
Ooh ooh

I'm on the outside looking in
And I wanna be, and I wanna be back on the inside with you
You are with somebody new, and I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm still in love with you (In love with you)

I'm on the outside looking in
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be left on the outside, all alone
Well, I guess I've had my day and you let me go my way
Now it's me who has to pay
Ooh, I never should have gone away
Never should have gone away and left you like I did (And left you)
With tears in your eyes
Oh, I thought you'd take me back
But to my surprise (To my surprise)

I'm on the outside looking in
Gotta find a way, gotta find a way back to your heart, dear, once again
Won't you take me back again? I'll be waiting here 'til then
On the outside looking in, ooh

Won't you take me back again? I'll be waiting here 'til then
On the outside looking in (I'm on the outside looking in)
Ooh (On the outside looking in)
(I'm on the outside looking in)
Don't leave me (On the outside looking in)You might also likeEmbed
