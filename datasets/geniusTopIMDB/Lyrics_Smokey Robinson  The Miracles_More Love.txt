More Love Lyrics
Ooh-ooh

Let it be soon, don't hesitate
Make it now, don't wait
(Right now, my love, don't wait)
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to start
When I can fill your heart
With more love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
And my love will be so solid
It would take a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down

This is no fiction, this is no act
This is real, it's a fact
(So real my love, it's a fact)
I'll always belong only to you
Each day I'll be living to
Make sure I'm giving you

More love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey, now, my love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
You might also like
As we grow older, no need to fear
When you need me, I'll be here
(Need me, my love, I'll be here)
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful
And keeping you youthful

With more, yeah, more joy
Than age or time can ever destroy
Oh honey, now, my love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down, wear it down, tear it down

Gonna give you more, ooh, and more joy
Than any age or time could ever destroy
Oh baby, now, my love will be so solid...Embed
