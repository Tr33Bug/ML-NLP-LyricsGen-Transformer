My Girl Has Gone LyricsWhen you were mine I loved you so much
A got a thrill from your every touch
You went away with somebody else
Now all I can say to comfort myself
Is that my girl has gone and said goodbye
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
Don't give up, give love one more try
'Cause there's a right girl for every guy
Baby, all your love wasn't right for me
Good for another it well may be
Some girls just weren't made for some guys
Now I've got to make myself realize
That my girl has gone (yes she has)
And said goodbye (I tell myself that)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Keep on trying)
Don't give up, give love one more try
(Believe me now)
There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah
I've got the feelin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah baby
Now happiness and all the best
That's all that I wish for you, oh yeah
Don't be like me in misery
I'm feelin' so sad and blue
I said I'm sad and I'm blue, oh yeah
Sad and I'm blue, I said I'm sad and I'm blue
Because my girl has gone
And said goodbye (and I tell myself)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Keep on trying)
Don't give up, give love one more try
(Believe me now)
There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah
You might also like(And I can't go on if I hear you say)
Girl has gone (yes you can) and said goodbye
(And I start to cry, I say)
Don't you cry, hold your head up high
(Ooowweeee! )
Don't give up, give love one more try
(One time now)
There's a right girl for every guy, oh yeah
Sing it slow now children...Embed
