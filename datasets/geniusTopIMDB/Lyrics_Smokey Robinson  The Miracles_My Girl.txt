My Girl LyricsI've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl, my girl, ooh)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl)
I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl, my girl, ooh)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh yeah
I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I've got all the riches, baby
One man can claim
Well, I guess you say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl, my girl, ooh)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl

With my girl
I even got the month of May
My girl
Talkin' 'bout
Talkin' 'bout
My girl
Talkin' 'bout my girlEmbed
