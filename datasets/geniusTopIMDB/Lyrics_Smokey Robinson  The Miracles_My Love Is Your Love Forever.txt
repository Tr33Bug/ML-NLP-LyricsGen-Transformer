My Love Is Your Love (Forever) LyricsYeah yeah (doo doo doo wooh)
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Ooh ooh (doo doo doo wooh)
Oh I never thought that love would ever smile on me, but now I see
All the while Lady Luck was saving her brightest smile just for me
And now girl (and now girl)
That I've found you (found you)
Come a little closer girl (closer girl)
Let me put my arms around you (around you)
The world is ours complete with stars
I'm in love, yeah
Clouds of grey on a rainy day
They no longer seem to bother me
'Cause in your love I found a Sun
That shines for me eternally
Goodbye now (goodbye now) to loneliness (loneliness)
Hello hello hello (hello, hello) to happiness (happiness)
Ooh I'm a lucky boy you're my pride and joy
I'm in love (love), yeah
My love now, is your love forever
Now my love is your love forever
And my friends all claim that they can see
A strange new change come over me
And I can't deny I'm a better guy
Than I ever used to be
Now girl (now girl) that I've found you (found you)
Come a little closer girl
Let me put my arms around you (around you)
The world is ours complete with stars
We're in love (love), ooh ooh
I'm a lucky boy you're my pride and joy
I'm in love (love), yeah
