Oh Baby Baby I Love You Lyrics
Come take my hand, let's walk the night
Somehow the moon and the stars seem right to tell you (To tell you)
I love you (I love you)

Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
I love you (I love you)

The beat of our hearts will set the pace
Now is the time and here is the place to tell you (To tell you)
I love you (I love you)
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
I love you (I love you)

It's been a long time getting here
But I'm sure you're worth the wait
A long time ago, I set a trap for you
And you finally took the bait
Yeah (Yeah), baby, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That look on your face that I see
Seems to say that you want me to tell you (To tell you)
I love you (I love you)

Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
I love you (I love you)

I've got some love in store for you
That you just can't afford to miss
Some sweet, sweet words to caress your ears
Will follow each and every kiss
Yeah (Yeah), my baby, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You might also like
I've got to tell you (To tell you)
I love you (I love you)
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
I love you (I love you)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ooh, I've got to tell you (To tell you)
I love you (I love you)
Time to tell you (Ooh, baby)
I love you (I love you)
Come take my hand, let's walk the nightEmbed
