Point It Out Lyrics
Point it out, point it out to me
Point it out, this I've got to see

You're the one that I'm crazy for
And everyday it seems I love you more and more
Now if there's some reason why I shouldn't love you
The way that I do with a love that is true
So go on and
Point it out girl, point it out to me
Though I doubt, it could ever be

Loves a hallway with so many doors
Which one did I go through that made me yours?
I want to close it up and never again
Leave from within to go back where I've been
So come on and

Point it out, point it out to to me
Lock it up throw away the key
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah-yeah

That magic somewhere only lovers know
That's where I want for you and me to go
A life of happiness is guaranteed
All that we need is love to succeed
So let me in

Point it out, yeah point it out to you
Show your love yeah, girl like you never knew
Point it out oh baby now point it out to me
Gonna show your lovin'You might also likeEmbed
