Promise Me Lyrics
Promise me
A lifetime of love and laughter
Promise me
Happiness is what you're after
And this my darling I will promise you
For every kiss you give me I'll give two

Promise me
You'll do your best to make this last forever
Promise me
We can spend a lifetime together
And this my darling I will promise you
For every year you give I'll give you two
Because I just hate disillusions
And relationships filled with confusion
And hopes that end in sad conclusions
Oh yeah, oh yeah (Promise me)

Oh yeah (Promise me)
Ooo Ooo Ooooo Ooo Ooooo

Promise me, (Promise me)
Give me your word and I'll never doubt you
Run to my arms. (Promise me)
They were made to wrap about you
And this my darling I will promise you
For every step you make I'll make two

Promise me, (Promise me)
Give me your word and I'll never doubt you
Ohhhh love, (Promise me)
I won't want to stay here without you
