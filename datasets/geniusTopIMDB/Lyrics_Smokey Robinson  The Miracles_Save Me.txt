Save Me LyricsNow I’ve cried a river since the day you said goodbye, mhmm
And if you don't come back
I'm going to drown in the tears I cry, mhmm
Save me
Save me
Come on and save me
I need you so
Like falling off a mountain slope, I'm sinking down so fast
Clinging to a twig of hope, that this separation won't last, mhmm
Save me
Why don't you save me?
It’s up to you to save me baby
I need you so
Mhmm, yeah, yeah
Hmm, without you here beside me, I'm only half alive
Hmm, stay away from me any longer and I can't survive, oh ho
Oh, save me
Why don’t you save me
Only you can save me baby
I need you so
I’m asking you to save me
I need you so
Only you can save me, yeah
I need you so
Oh, save me, save me, save meYou might also likeEmbed
