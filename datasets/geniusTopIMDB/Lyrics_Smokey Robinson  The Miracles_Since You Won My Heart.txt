Since You Won My Heart Lyrics(Since you've won my heart)
My, but my days seem brighter
Oh my, but my heart feels lighter
My, but my wrongs seem righter
Since you've won my heart
(Since you've won my heart)
Oh boy
But you haven't brought anything but joy
Like a baby with a brand-new toy
Ooh, since you've won my heart
Let me tell you that you're everything I ever wanted, to me, you're so exact
You know the right things to say, you know just how to act
I'm giving you all my love and that's a natural fact
'Cause I'm so glad I found you, gonna build my world around you
Oh my (Oh my), but my nights seem shorter
Since I (Since I) met your mother's only daughter
Why (Oh why?) don't you love me like you oughta?
Since you won my heart
(Since you won my heart)
Everything is alright
(Since you've won my heart)
Every day and every night
(Since you've won my heart)
I'm walking around on a cloud
(Since you've won my heart)
I'm really feeling light in love
(Since you've won my heart)
