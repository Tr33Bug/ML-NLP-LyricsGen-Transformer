Special Occasion LyricsHmm, hmm, yeah
Special occasion
Like when you dress up
In your tie and tails
Yeah, yeah
Special occasion
Every time and it never fails
To give me a thrill
That's fresh and new
Every time I'm kissing you
It's something that you do
That makes every time you kiss me
A real special occasion
Like one that calls for
A toast of champagne
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Special occasion
Every time and it's hard to explain
How the same old touch
From the same old hand
Can make me feel
Like a different man
I just can't understand
But every time you touch me
It's a real special occasion
Yeah, yeah
Special occasion, oh, oh yeah
Hmm hmm, yeah
Ooh, beautiful music begins to play
You are the sun
That brightens up my day
Why don't you stay
'Cause every time I'm with you
It's a real special occasion
Like when in school
You get your cap and gown
Yeah, now
It's a real special occasion
Every time you come around
Baby, it's a real special occasionYou might also likeEmbed
