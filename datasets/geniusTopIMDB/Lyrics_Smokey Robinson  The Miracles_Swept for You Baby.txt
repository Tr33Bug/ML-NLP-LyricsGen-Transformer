Swept for You Baby Lyrics
You know that I'm swept for you baby
And it's time you were told
Yeah, I'm swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul

The first time that I saw you, you stood out from the crowd
Looking so good and walking so proud
I wanted to say as you passed my way
You know that I'm swept for you baby, ah yeah
And it's time you were told
Oh oh oh yeah, I'm swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul

I'm just like a falling leaf on a windy day
And you like the breeze that comes and sweeps me away
You're like a broom, I'm like dust in the room

Cause I'm swept for you baby, oh yeah
And it's time you were told
Ooh, I'm swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul

You sweep me off my feet every time that you pass me by
Your presence in a room puts me on air
I don't have to see you to know when you're there
It's crazy but it's true

Ooh, I'm swept baby, baby
And it's time you were told
Ooh, I'm swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul
Can't help but miss you
And it's time you were told
Yeah, I'm swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul
I'm swept, I'm swept, I'm sweptYou might also likeEmbed
