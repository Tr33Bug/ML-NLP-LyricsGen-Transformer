The Tears of a Clown Lyrics
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin’ to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin’ you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)
Oh, sadder than sad
(I'm hurt so bad)
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
(I pretend to be glad)
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)

Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)
I'm hurt and I want you to know
(Want you to know)
But for others I put on a show
(It's just a show) Ooh-oh
You might also like
There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah

Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry

The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown)
Make you think that I don't care
When really I'm sad
Hurtin’ so bad (Tears of a clown)
Cryin’ all the time...7Embed
