Thereâ€™s A Sad Story Here Lyrics
Look in my eyes
You'll see that I'm a guy who
Tried the blues on for size
It only takes one glance
And a fool would be wise

There's a sad, sad, sad (Sad, sad)
Story here (Sad, sad)
Oh, and I'm the one to tell ya
Just watch me close
I know around all over town
From pillow to post
I never laugh, I only have
Half smile at the most

There's a sad, real sad (Sad, sad)
Story here (Sad, sad)
Oh yeah, yeah

Now, I had a love, mm hmm
But I did the girl wrong so much until
Push came to shove
Now the girl is gone
And I'm a real victim of

The a sad, sad (Sad, sad)
Sad story here (Sad, sad)
Oh, oh yeah, uh huh (Sad, sad)

I never knew how much love really mattered
But now she's gone and my whole world's been shattered
You might also like
Ooh, and the pieces need mending
I got to get you back, baby
On this my life is depending
You and you alone can have such a
Such a happy ending

To this sad, sad, sad, sad (Sad, sad)
Story here (Sad, sad)
Oh yeah, ohh (Sad, sad)
And every day it seems to get a little sad (Sad, sad)
Ooh baby (Sad, sad)
Every day the pain seems to (Sad, sad)
Hurt just a little bad (Sad, sad)
Ah, yeah yeah (Sad, sad)
Ooh, sad ...Embed
