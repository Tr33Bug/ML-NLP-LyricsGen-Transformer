Weâ€™ve Come Too Far to End It Now Lyrics
Ooh
Oh, oh

Last night, we had an argument
Oh, oh yes, we did
Although, baby (Baby, baby), the things I said
I never meant

Girl (Girl), I'm so sorry (I'm so sorry)
That I broke your tender heart
For we've come too far to end it now
Believe me
You say you're satisfied
And we can leave things just like this
Oh, oh baby (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
But what you don't realize is
Without your love, I can't exist

So (So, so, so), please, oh, please have mercy (Please have mercy)
On me (On me), can't you see (Can't you see)
Oh, that we've come much too far to end it now?

Mmm

Oh, we've come much too far to end it now, baby

Now I know our love
Is much too very strong
(Yes, it is, yes, it is, oh yes, it is, ooh) Oh yeah, baby
To ever think about ending this
Would be so very wrong
(Yes, it will, oh yes, it will) Oh
You might also like
We've had arguments before
But there's one thing you must know
That I think we've come much too far to end it now
Oh baby (Much too far)

Oh, we've come much too far to end it (Now)
Baby, don't ya know I could never let you go?
Really love you so, gotta let ya know
We've come much too far, ah (To end it now)
Baby, come to me, gotta make you see
We can make it last, just like in the past
We've come much too far to end itEmbed
