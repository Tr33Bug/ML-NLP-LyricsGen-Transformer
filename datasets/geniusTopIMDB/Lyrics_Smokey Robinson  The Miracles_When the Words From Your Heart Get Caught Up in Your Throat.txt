When the Words From Your Heart Get Caught Up in Your Throat Lyrics
Ooh

My heart has been trying to express itself
And it's really getting me down
There's a strange effect that comes over me
Whenever you're around
I have so much confidence when I'm by myself
It's like my nerves wore an armored coat
But baby, now, you're such a charmer
You melt that coat of armor
And the words from my heart get caught up in my throat
Maybe I'd better write a note
My heart is getting discouraged with giving me
Line after line after line
But my lips can't relay what my heart has to say
They stutter and stammer each time
If I don't tell you soon what my heart wants to say
My chance will get more remote
But each time you've given me
The opportunity
The words from my heart get caught up in my throat
Maybe I'd better write a note
Ooh

I make the same promises to my heart every morning
That the very next time we met
I would tell you that I loved you and make you mine
By the time the sun starts to set
I rehearsed my lines a thousand times
Read some sweet poetry I could quote
But when you open your door to greet me
Smiling oh so sweetly
The words from my heart get caught up in my throat

I think I'd better write a note
I want to say the words but they're (Caught up in my throat)
I'm gonna find myself a pencil, 'cause I (Better write a note)You might also likeEmbed
