Whole Lot of Shakinâ€™ in My Heart (Since I Met You) LyricsI can't explain the things you do to me
But I'm sure there's an explanation
Maybe it's the way you carry yourself
Or maybe it's your conversation
You got me tiptoeing on a cloud
I pray that I might fall through
And hit rock bottom, soon to be forgotten
Like so many other people do
I need you to help me convince myself (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
That besides me there's no-one else (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
'Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
Don't you know I a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
The guys I used to hang around with
Tell me that I've changed, that I'm acting kinda strange
But they don't realise that since I met you
My whole life has been rearranged
You make me feel kinda insecure
'Cause my heart, I can no longer control
And you've got me knocking, jumping and stopping
Don't know which way I'm supposed to go
My heart is all tied up in knots (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
'Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
Don't you know I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
My heart is all tied up in knots (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
I walk around daily in a state of shock (oh-oh-oh, I love you)
'Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met you
Don't you know I feel a whole lot of shakin' in my heart since I met youYou might also likeEmbed
