Whoâ€™s Gonna Take the Blame Lyrics
Mhm
Mm-mm

We were just kids playin' in the rain
When you threw a stone and you broke a windowpane
You were so afraid for what you'd done
That I held your hand, little one, and I wouldn't let you run, woah
Then you turned to me with a look of shame on your face
And your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly, oh
Who will take the blame? Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me
Mhm

At the age of twelve, you were a fine young thing
But I felt much older 'cause I had to shoulder the trouble you'd bring
Like the time you pushed Sonny down and she cut her knee
With those same big eyes, you turned and you looked at me, oh

Who will take the blame? Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew how it would always be
Put the blame, put it on me
Put it on me, put it on me

Now you're all grown up and you're running wild
And they're so surprised 'cause all along, you seemed like such a sweet child
And there's nothing but bad news from all the friends I meet
How you've become a, a woman of the streets, oh
And they give me a million and one reasons why
But when I analyze it, I know where the real fault lies, oh
You might also like
Who will take the blame? Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it, ooh, this time rightfully
Put the blame, put it on me, oh-oh
Who will take the blame? (Who's, I said, who's) Who's gonna bear the shame?
Put the blame, put it on me, oh-oh

Who will take the blame? Who's gonna bear the shame?
Put the blame, put it on me, oh-oh
Who will take the blame? (Put it on me) Who's gonna bear the shame? (Put it on me)
Put the blame, put it on meEmbed
