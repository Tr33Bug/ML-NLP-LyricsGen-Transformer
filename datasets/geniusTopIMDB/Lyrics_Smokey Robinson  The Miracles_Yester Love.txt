Yester Love Lyrics
Ooh-oo-oo

Yesterday we made future plans
She loved me I could tell
Can today be that tomorrow that we planned so well?
Yester baby I'll never forget her
Though tomorrow might bring me one better

Today I'll be on my away to love my yester love
Today I'll go on my way to love my yester love, oh oh
Yesterday I felt a tender kiss upon my face
Now the day is gone and there's a tear drop in it's place
Oh yester kisses that I used to treasure
Now you're given some other lips pleasure

Today I'm on my way dreamin of my yester love
Today I'll go on my way dreamin of my yester love, oh oh

Yester is, the prefix, that we fix, to things that have gone by
Forever they say, yeah even though my yester love
Has slipped through my fingers I find it still lingers
In my heart today-ay-ay

Yesterday I thought I had a love to call my own
No one could have told me that today I'd be alone
Oh oh yes the sweetness today has gone sour
Seemin further away with each hour

Today I'll go on my way dreamin of all my yester love
Today I'll go on my way dreamin of my yester love
Today I'll go on my way dreamin of my yester loveYou might also likeEmbed
