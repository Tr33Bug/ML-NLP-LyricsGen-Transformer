Your Motherâ€™s Only Daughter Lyrics
I've been throwing coins in every fountain
Wishing on every star that shines at night
It could be I've been counting too much on stars and fountains
That only twinkle and sprinkle me with water

But it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter
Said it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter

I spent my last ten dollars on some perfume
And I thought it said the things I couldn't say
The storeman guaranteed that this was what I need
But it turns out that it wasn't worth a quarter
'Cause it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter
Said it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter

The only girl your mama's got
And anyone can see that she loves you a lot
But so do I and I'm a man
And you're the only girl that fits into my plan
Of a love life made for two
If a man was good for mama, a man is good for you
A man is good for you, a man is good for you
Ooh

So many things I've tried to get you by my side
But nothing seems to work like honor

'Cause it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter
Said it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter
Ooh, it didn't help me get your mother's only, ooh
Said it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter
Hey, it didn't help me get your mother's only daughter, ooh-ooh
It didn't help me get your mother's only daughterYou might also likeEmbed
