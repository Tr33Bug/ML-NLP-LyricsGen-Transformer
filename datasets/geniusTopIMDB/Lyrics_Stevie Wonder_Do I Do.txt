Do I Do Lyrics
When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Baby

Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love

From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss
You might also like
Sugar, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Alright

Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love
Ladies and gentlemen
I have the pleasure to present on my album
Mr. Dizzy Gillespie...Blow!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!

Do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Oh, I don't care how long it might take
Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Oh, yeah
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

Girl, I've got some chocolate kisses for your loving, baby
Oh, yeah
Do you want some candy?
Do you want some honeysuckle?
Do you want some chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you?
Girl, if you felt everything you heard me say
Turn your feelings in your heart back to me right away
And I'll get it

Do I do (Do I do)

I know the record's about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So, if you donâ€™t like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha
Now everybody's talking about the jive is in
Well, I know I've got something for your body
Cause I
