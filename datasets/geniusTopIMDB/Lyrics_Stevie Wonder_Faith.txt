TranslationsFran√ßaisFaith Lyrics
See the girl with the diamonds in her shoes? Yeah
She walks around like she's got nothin' to lose
Yeah, she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
So I wrote some letters out in big bold type

I got faith in you, baby
I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
See the boy with the Stevie Wonder swag?
Ain't got a clue all the magic that he has
He's a go-getter, he's everybody's type
I'ma make it my mission, make him feel alright
He's a twelve on a ten point, rockin' out to his joint
Just say the word 'cause I could sing all night

I got faith (Faith) in you, baby
I got faith (Oh) in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow (Love you somehow)
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

Faith
Yes I do, mmm
I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
I get around ya and my mind goes crazy
I think about you mornin', noon, night and day
I got faith in you, honey (I get around you and my mind goes crazy)
I got faith in you, girl (I think about you mornin', noon, night and day)
I got faith in you, honey (Baby)
I got faith in you, girl
I met you, hallelujah
You might also like
I got faith (Faith) in you, baby (Baby)
I got faith (Faith; oh) in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me (Woo)
Know that I love you somehow (Love you somehow)
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith (Faith, faith, baby)
I got faith (Faith) in you, baby (Baby)
I got faith (Faith) in you now (Oh)
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow (Yes, I do)
I met you, hallelujah
I met you, hallelujah
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith
