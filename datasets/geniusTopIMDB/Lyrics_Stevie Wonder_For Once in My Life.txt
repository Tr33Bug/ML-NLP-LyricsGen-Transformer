For Once in My Life LyricsFor once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow, I know I'll be strong
For once, I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life, I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone who needs me
Hey, hey, hey, hey yeah
Oh, I'm in love, baby

For once in my life, I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me
Someone who needs me
For once in my life
Somebody that needs me
