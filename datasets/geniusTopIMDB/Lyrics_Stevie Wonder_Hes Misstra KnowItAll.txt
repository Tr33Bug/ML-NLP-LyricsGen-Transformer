Heâ€™s Misstra Know-It-All Lyrics
He's a man with a plan
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Playing hard, talking fast
Making sure that he won't be the last
He's Misstra Know-It-All

Makes a deal with a smile
Knowing all the time that his lie's a mile
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Must be seen, there's no doubt
He's the coolest one with the biggest mouth
He's Misstra Know-It-All
When you tell him he's living fast
He will say, "What do you know?
If you had my kind of cash
You'd have more than one place to go"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Any place, he will play
His only concern is how much you'll pay
He's Misstra Know-It-All
If he shakes on a bet
He's the kind of dude that won't pay his debt
Oh, He's Misstra Know-It-All

When you say that he's living wrong
He'll tell you he knows he's living right
And you'd be a stronger man
If you took Misstra Know-It-All's advice, oh oh
Ooh-ooh, mmm-mmm-mmm

He's the man with a plan
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Take my word, please beware
Of a man that just don't give a care, no
He's Misstra Know-It-All
(Look out, he's coming!)

Don't you know we'd have a better land?

So give a hand to the man
Although you've given out as much as you can
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Hey, you talk too much
You worry me to death, hey

He's some kind of fella
Thinking of only himself
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man
That you know has got a super plan
