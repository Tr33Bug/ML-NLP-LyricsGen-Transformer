Loveâ€™s in Need of Love Today Lyrics
Good morn' or evening, friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain

It's that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far
The force of evil plans to make you its possession
And it will if we let it destroy everybody
We all must take precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say, woah-oh

That love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far
People, you know that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away, hey
You know that hate's, hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop, stop it please before it's gone too far
It's up to you 'cause love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's, hate's goin' 'round
Breaking, hate's tried to break my heart many times
Don't, you've got to stop it please before, before, before
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' 'round, hate's goin' 'round
Hate's goin' around and it tried breaking up many hearts
You've got to, I've got to, they've got to, we've got to, they've got to, we've got to stop it before it's gone too far
Love's, love's in need of love
Did you ever think that love would be in need of love today?
Don't delay, send yours in right away, ooh-oh, hey
Bring it down a little
Love is very peaceful, so bring it down a little
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
