Ngiculela - Es Una Historia - I Am Singing LyricsNgiculela ikusasa
Ngiyacula ngo thando
Ngicula ngelinyi langa
Uthando luyobusa
Jikelele kulomhlaba wethu
Es una historia de mañana
Es una historia de amor
Es una historia que amor reinará
Por nuestro mundo
Es una historia de mi corazón
There's songs to make you smile
There's songs to make you sad
But with a happy song to sing
It never seems as bad
To me came this melody
So I've tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me
I am singing of tomorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing someday love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
I am singing of love from my heart
Let's all sing someday sweet love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
Let's start singing
Of love from our hearts
Let's start singing
Of love from our heartsYou might also like4Embed
