Pastime Paradise Lyrics
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been wasting most of their time
Glorifying days long gone behind
They've been wasting most their days
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise

Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?
Dissipation, race relations
Consolation, segregation
Dispensation, isolation
Exploitation, mutilation
Mutation, miscreation
Confirmation to the evils of the world
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been looking in their minds
For the day that sorrow's lost from time
They keep telling of the day
When the savior of love will come to stay

Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?

Proclamation of race relations
Consolation is integration
Verification of revelation
Acclamation, world salvation
Vibration, stimulation
Confirmation to the peace of the world

They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
We've been spending too much of our lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Let's start living our lives
Living for the future paradise
Praise to our lives
Living for the future paradise
Shame to anyone's life
