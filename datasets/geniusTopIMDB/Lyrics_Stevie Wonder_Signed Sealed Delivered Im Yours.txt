Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours Lyrics
Hey, hey
Oh yeah, baby

Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Mm
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Ay
Here I am, baby, oh, oh
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands
Ah, here I am, baby, ah, ah
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands, hey, hey

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, ayy, hey, yeah, yeah
Didn't I? Oh baby

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
Ah, I’m yours!
Ooh wee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
Ooh baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours! Hey

Here I am, baby, whoa-oh
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, ah)
You got my future in your hands, baby, hey
Here I am, baby, ah, ah
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
You got my future in your hands, baby, yeah
You might also like
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man
But here, I, ah, with your future, got your future, baby, I, I

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby, ah
Here I am baby, get it
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, yeah
(Get it, get it, get it, oh baby)
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, yeah
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)4Embed
