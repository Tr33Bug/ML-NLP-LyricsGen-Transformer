Talkbox Medley (Close To You / Never Can Say Goodbye) Lyrics
Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time that you are near to me baby?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes
So true
And that is why
Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
There's a very strange vibration
Piercin' me right to the core
It says, "Turn around you fool
You know, you love her more and more"
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, no no no
I never can say goodbye...You might also like9Embed
