Too High Lyrics
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky

She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the T.V. screen
She takes another puff and says "It's a crazy scene"
That red is green and she's a tangerine
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high, I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down

She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice, she wasn't very nice

I'm too high, I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky
I'm too high, I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die

She's a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
And did you hear the news about the girl today?
She passed away, what did her friend say?

They said she's too high, too high
Can't hang around anyway...You might also like5Embed
