You Are the Sunshine of My Life Lyrics
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever, you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears, woah
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm-mmm, yeah-yeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever, you'll stay in my heart

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue, ooh
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you, woah?

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm (Baby)
You are the apple of my eye
Forever, you'll stay in my heart, yeah
You are my sunshine of my life, oh, yeahYou might also like1Embed
