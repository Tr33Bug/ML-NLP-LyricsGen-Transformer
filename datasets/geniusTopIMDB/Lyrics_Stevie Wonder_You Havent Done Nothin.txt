You Haven’t Done Nothin’ Lyrics
We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothin'!'"
It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else, yeah

And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothin'!"

Jackson 5, join along with me, say
Doo doo wop—hey hey hey
Doo doo wop—oh whoa whoa
Doo doo wop—mmm now now
Doo doo wop—oh oh oh
Doo doo wop—dum dum dum
Doo doo wop

We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life, mmm
But when misled who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice, mmm hmm
You might also like
Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong?
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
"You haven't done nothin'!!!!"
Yeah, now

Jackson 5, say it one more 'gain, say
Doo doo wop—na na na
Doo doo wop—oh
Doo doo wop—mmm co co
Doo doo wop—sing it, yeah
Doo doo wop—bum bum bum
Doo doo wop—mmm bum bum
Doo doo wop—mmm bum bum
Doo doo wop—sing it loud for your people, say
Doo doo wop—mmm dum dum
Doo doo wop—stand up, be counted, say
Doo doo wop—go go go
Doo doo wop—oh
Doo doo wop—mmm bum bum
Doo doo wop—mmm
Doo doo wop—brr eh deh deh
Doo doo wop—dum dum dum dum3Embed
