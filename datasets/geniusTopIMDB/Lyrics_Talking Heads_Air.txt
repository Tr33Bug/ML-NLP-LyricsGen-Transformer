Air Lyrics
(Air, air, air, air)

Hit me in the face
I run faster
Faster, faster, faster, faster
Faster into the air
I say to myself

What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?
Air can hurt you too
Air can hurt you too
Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people never had experience with
(Air, air, air, air)

It can break your heart
So remember
Remember, remember, remember, remember
When the weather gets rough
You'll say to yourself

What is happening to my skin?
Where is that protection that I needed?

Air can hurt you too
Air can hurt you too
Some people say not to worry about the air
Some people never had experience with
(Air, air, air, air)
