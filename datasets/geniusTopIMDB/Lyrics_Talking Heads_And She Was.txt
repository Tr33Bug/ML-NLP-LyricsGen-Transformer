And She Was LyricsHey!

And she was lying in the grass
And she could hear the highway breathing
And she could see a nearby factory
She's making sure she is not dreaming
See the lights of a neighbor's house
Now she's starting to rise
Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes
The world was moving and she was
Right there with it, and she was
The world was moving, she was
Floating above it, and she was
And she was

And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
And she's drifting this way and that
Not touching the ground at all
And she's up above the yard

The world was moving, and she was right there with it
And she was
Hey, hey
The world was moving, she was floating above it
And she was
Hey, hey, hey

And she was glad about it, no doubt about it
She isn't sure about what she's done
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what she's done
And she was
Hey, he-hey, hey!

And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
She's moving out in all directions, oh, oh, oh

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

The world was moving, she was right there with it
And she was
The world was moving, she was floating above it
And she was
Joining the world of missing persons
And she was (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Missing enough to feel alright
And she was, ha, ha

And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was, hey, hey
And she was
And she was
And she was4Embed
