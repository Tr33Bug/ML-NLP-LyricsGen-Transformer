Animals Lyrics
Ah, ah, ah, ah

I'm mad and that's a fact
I found out animals don't help
Animals think they're pretty smart
Shit on the ground, see in the dark

They wander around like a crazy dog
Make a mistake in the parking lot
Always bumping into things
Always let you down, down, down, down
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Animals think they understand
Trusting them, a big mistake
Animals want to change my life
I will ignore animals' advice

They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them
They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them down, down, down, down

I know the animals are laughing at us
Don't even know what a joke is
I won't follow animals' advice
I don't care if they're laughing at us

They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them
They're never there when you need them
They're never there when you call them down, down, down
Ah, ah, ah

They say they don't need money, they're living on nuts and berries
They say animals don't worry, they're living on nuts and berries
You know animals are hairy? They say animals don't worry
They think they know what's best, they're making a fool of us
They ought to be more careful, they're setting a bad example
They say animals don't worry, they're living on nuts and berries
They're setting a bad example, they ought to be more careful
(Laugh at me)
You know animals are hairy? They're living on nuts and berries
(Laugh at me)
They want to know what's best, they're making a fool of us
(Laugh at me)
They ought to be more careful, they're setting a bad example
(Laugh at me)
They like to laugh at people, they're setting a bad example
(Laugh at me)
They have untroubled lives, they think that every thing's nice
(Laugh at me)
You know they don't need money? They say animals don't worry
(Go ahead and laugh at me)
They're living on nuts and berries, you know animals are hairy?
(Laugh at me)
They think they know what's best, they're making a fool of us
(Laugh at me)
They like to laugh at people, they're making a bad example
(Go ahead and laugh at me)
They say they don't need money, you know animals are hairy?
(Laugh at me)
They're living on nuts and berries, they say they don't need money
(Go ahead and laugh at me)
They're setting a bad example, they ought to be more careful
(Go ahead and laugh at me)You might also likeEmbed
