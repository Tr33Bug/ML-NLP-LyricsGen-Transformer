Burning Down the House Lyrics
Ah
Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool, babies – strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

Hold tight, wait till the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house
Here's your ticket, pack your bag, it's time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire, ah!

All wet, here, you might need a raincoat
Shake-down, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say, “Baby, what did you expect?”
Gonna burst into flame, ah

Burning down the house

My house is out of the ordinary
That’s right, don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house
You might also like
No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing, yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire, ah
