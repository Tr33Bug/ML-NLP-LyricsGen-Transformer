Houses in Motion Lyrics
For a long time I felt without style or grace
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew I'd be able to do these things

And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where he's at
He can't afford to stop, that is what he believe
He'll keep on digging for a thousand years
I'm walking a line, I'm thinking about empty motion
I'm walking a line, just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way, no time to begin
This isn't the time, so nothing was done
Not talking about, not many at all
I'm turning around, no trouble at all
You notice there's nothing around you, around you
I'm walking a line, divide and dissolve

Never get to say much, never get to talk
Tell us a little bit, but not too much
Right about then, is where she give up
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope

I'm walking a line, I hate to be dreaming in motion
I'm walking a line, just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way, no time to begin
This isn't the time, so nothing was done
Not talking about, not many at all
I'm turning around, no trouble at all
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
I'm walking a line, divide and dissolve
You might also like
I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards
I'm moving twice as much as I was before
I'll keep on digging to the center of the Earth
I'll be down in there moving the in the room...

I'm walking a line, I'm visiting houses in motion
I'm walking a line, just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way, no time to begin
This isn't the time, so nothing was done
Not talking about, not many at all
I'm turning around, no trouble at all
Two different houses surround you, 'round you
I'm walking a line, divide and dissolve1Embed
