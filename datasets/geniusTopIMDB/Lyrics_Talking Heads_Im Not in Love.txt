Iâ€™m Not in Love Lyrics
Okay!

Pretty!
What is brand new? It's not what I think of you
You'll touch me in a minute, but that's not what I want to do
We are two strangers, we might never have met
We can talk forever, I understand what you said

But I'm not in love
What does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love?
You know it!
Is there time for this? Is this responsibility?
Girl time, boy time, is that the difference between you and me?
I won't ask any questions, who needs to make a new start?
I choose to believe you, I said before that I can't

'Cause I'm not in love
What does it take to fall in love?
Do people really fall in love?

Feelings!
Take it easy, baby, don't let your feelings get in the way
I believe someday we'll live in a world without love
I can answer your questions if you won't twist what I say
Please respect my opinions, they will be respected some day

But I don't need love
There'll come a day when we won't need love
I believe that we don't need loveYou might also like1Embed
