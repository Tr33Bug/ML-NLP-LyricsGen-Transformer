Mind Lyrics
Time won't change you
Money won't change you

I haven't got the faintest idea
Everything seems to be up in the air at this point

I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
Drugs won't change you
Religion won't change you (What's a matter with you?)

I haven't got the faintest idea
Everything seems to be up in the air at this time

I need something to change your mind (Mind)
I need something to change your mind (Mind)
I need something to change your mind (Mind)
I need something to change your mind (Mind)

Science won't change you
Looks like I can't change you

I try to talk to you to, to make things clear
But you're not even listening to me
And it comes directly from my heart to you

I need something to change your mind (Mind)
I need something to change your mind (Mind)
I need something to change your mind (Mind)
I need something to change your mind (Mind)You might also like1Embed
