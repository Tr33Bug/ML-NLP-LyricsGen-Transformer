Moon Rocks LyricsFlying saucers, levitation
Yo! I could do that
Gettin' ready for heavy duty
Go on, give it a chance
Give it a chance, give it a chance
I saw your hair start to curl
So get up, write it down
You better wait for a while
So take your hands out of your pockets and get your face adjusted
I heard it, somebody lied
And I'm staring out the window, gonna let this thing continue
In its natural time
Round heads, square heads
Get settled in
You can hear my belly rumble
There's a voice that starts to mumble
Woo! It's starting to sing
Protons, neutrons
I ate a rock from the moon
Got shocked once, shocked twice
Let's see what it can do
A man in the moon, a moon in the man
I got a rock in my throat
Upside, upside down
My tummy start to talk (what it say?)
Gonna rock it 'till I shock it, gonna kick it 'till I drop it
Woo! love at first sight
You can kick it, you can poke it, woo! I think you broke it
Ooh, what about that?
Skin from a snake, blood from a stone
You know, that ain't no lie
I got hundreds of expressions, try to make a good impression
Woo! Right between the eye
I don't mind, let me go
Right on time, I don't know
Let me be, why not stay
I feel numb, let me play
I got wild imagination, talkin' transubstantiation
Any version will do
I got mass communication, I'm the human corporation
I ate a rock from the moon
Moon in the rock, rock in the moon
There's a moon in my throat
You might think I'm wasting time, you might laugh but not for long
Hey! I'm working it out (work it out)
You might also likeI don't mind, let me go
Sounds inside, I don't know
Let me be, why not stay
I feel numb, let me playEmbed
