(Nothing But) Flowers Lyrics
Here we stand
Like an Adam and Eve
Waterfalls
Garden of Eden
Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
Birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs, cars have run on gasoline
Where? Where have they gone?
Now, it's nothing but flowers
There was a factory
Now there are mountains and rivers
You've got it, you've got it
We caught a rattlesnake
Now we've got something for dinner
You've got it, you've got it
There was a shopping mall
Now it's all covered with flowers
You've got it, you've got it
If this is paradise
I wish I had a lawn mower
You've got it, you've got it

Years ago
I was an angry young man
I'd pretend
That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With the beautiful highway
This used to be real estate, now it's only fields and trees
Where? Where is the town?
Now, it's nothing but flowers
You might also like
The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that we'd start over
But, I guess I was wrong

Once there were parking lots
Now it's a peaceful oasis
You've got it, you've got it
This was a Pizza Hut
Now it's all covered with daises
You've got it, you've got it
I miss the honky tonks
Dairy Queens, and 7-Elevens
You've got it, you've got it
And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
You've got it, you've got it


I dream of cherry pies
Candy bars, and chocolate chip cookies
You've got it, you've got it
We used to microwave
Now we just eat nuts and berries
You've got it, you've got it
This was a discount store
Now it's turned into a cornfield
You've got it, you've got it
Don't leave me stranded here
I can't get used to this lifestyle3Embed
