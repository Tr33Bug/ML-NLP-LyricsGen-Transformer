Pulled Up Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh-uh-oh-oh-oh-ah!

Mommy, Daddy, come and look at me now
I'm a big man in a great big town
Years ago, who would believe it's true?
Goes to show what a little faith can do

I was complaining, I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
I slipped, and I got pulled, pulled up
I tripped, and then you pulled, you pulled me up
I slipped, and I got pulled, pulled up
I slipped, and then you pulled, you pulled me up

Pulled me up-up, pulled me up-up-up-ah!
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

I drift away to another land
Sleeping, dreaming, such a simple thing
I think of things that I might be
I see my name go down in history

I was complaining, I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up!
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

I slipped, and I got pulled, pulled up
I tripped, and then you pulled, you pulled me up
I tripped, and I got pulled, pulled up
I slipped, and then you pulled, you pulled me up!
You might also like
Pulled me up-up, pulled me up-up-up-ah!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

I got up 'cause you pulled me up
I stood up 'cause you pulled me up
I got up and that was because you pulled me up
I got up in a little while, you pulled me up
Up, pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
Aye-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
Aye-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

I cast a shadow on the living room wall
Dark and savage with a profile so sharp
Keep that wonderful food on the table
There's really no hurry, I'll eat in a while

I was complaining, I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up!
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
I slipped, and I got pulled, pulled up
I tripped, and then you pulled, you pulled me up
I slipped, and I got pulled, pulled up
I slipped, and then you pulled, you pulled me up!

Pulled me up-up, pulled me up-up-up, oh I got!
Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya-yeah
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!
Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
Pulled me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!Embed
