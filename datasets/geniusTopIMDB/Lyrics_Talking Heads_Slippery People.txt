Slippery People Lyrics
What about the time you were rollin' over
Fall on your face, you must be having fun
Walk lightly, think of a time
You'd best believe this thing is real
Put away that gun, this part is simple
Try to recognize what is in your mind
God help us, help us to surmise
These slippery people help us understand

What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I see his face (The Lord won't mind)
Don't play no games (He's alright)
Look from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
I remember when sittin' in the tub
Pulled out the plug, the water was runnin' out
Cool down, stop actin' crazy
They're gonna leave and we'll be on our own
Seven times five, they were living creatures
Watch 'em come to life right before your eyes
Backsliding, how do you do?
These slippery people gonna see you through

What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
How do you know? (The Lord won't mind)
No, no, no games (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel


What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I see his face (The Lord won't mind)
How do you know? (He's alright)
And we're going to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I see his face (The Lord won't mind)
How do you know? (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (He's alright)
See for yourself (The Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (Right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheelYou might also like8Embed
