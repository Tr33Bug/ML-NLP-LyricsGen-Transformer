Stay Up Late Lyrics
Mommy had a little baby
There he is, fast asleep
He's just a little plaything
Why not wake him up?
Cute, cute little baby
Little pee pee, little toes
Now he's comin' to me
Crawl across the kitchen floor

Baby, baby, please let me hold him
I wanna make him stay up all night
Sister, sister, he's just a plaything
We wanna make him stay up all night
Yeah, we do
See him drink from a bottle
See him eat from a plate
Cute, cute as a button
Don't you wanna make him stay up late?
And we're having fun with no money
Little smile on his face
Don't you love the little baby?
Don't you want to make him stay up late?

Baby, baby, please let me hold him
I wanna make him stay up all night
Sister, sister, he's just a plaything
We wanna make him stay up all night

Here we go (all night long)
Sister, sister (all night long)
In the playpen, woo! (all night long)
Little baby goes, ha! (all night long)
I know you want to leave me
Why don't we pretend
There you go little man
Cute, cute, why not?
Late at night, wake him up
You might also like
Baby, baby, please let me hold him
I wanna make him stay up all night
Sister, sister, he's just a plaything
We wanna make him stay up all night

Here we go, ha! (all night long)
Sister, sister, woo! With the television on
Little baby goes, woo! (all night long)
Hey, hey, baby! (all night long)
And he looks so cute (all night long)
In his little red suit (all night long)
Rock on! (all night long)
All night long
All night long
All night long1Embed
