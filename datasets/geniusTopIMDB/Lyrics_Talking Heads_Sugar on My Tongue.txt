Sugar on My Tongue LyricsOh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
She's my neighbor, fill my cup
I'll bet you, baby, she can fill it up
She'll put the sugar on my tongue
Will she gimme, gimme, gimme some?
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna gimme, gimme, gimme some?
She'll put it right there on my tongue
Put it right there on my tongue
Sweet, sweet, lover, lover
Never, never, never find another
To put sugar on my tongue
Gimme, gimme, gimme some
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna gimme, gimme, gimme some?
She'll put it right there on my tongue
Put it right there on my tongue
I've been waiting years and years
Finally I see that you appear
My friends are here, and they ask of me
"Is this the time that we're gonna see her
Put the sugar on your tongue?"
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna put sugar on my tongue?
Is she gonna gimme, gimme some?
She'll put it right there on my tongue
Put it right there on my tongue
Sugar, sugar on my tongue
