Tentative Decisions LyricsNow that I can release my tensions
Let me make clear my best intentions
Girls ask: can I define decision?
Boys ask: can I describe their function?
Oh the boys want to talk
Would like to talk about those problems
And the girls say they're concerned
-       (that they are)
Concerned with decisiveness
And it's a hard logic to follow
-       and the girls get lost
And the boys say they're concerned
-       (that they are)
Concerned with decisiveness
(I wanna talk) I wanna talk as much as I want
(I'm gonna give) I'm gonna give the problem to you
(I wanna talk) I wanna talk as much as I want
(I'm gonna give) I'm gonna give the problem to you
Decide, decide, make up your mind
Decide, decide, I told you what to say
Confuse, confuse, describe what I found
Confuse, confuse, I told you what to say*

Oh the girls still want to talk
Would like to talk about those problems
And the boys say they're concerned
-       (that they are)
Concerned with decisiveness
And it's a hard logic I know
-       and the girls get lost
And the boys say they're concerned
-       (that they are)
Concerned with decisiveness
(I wanna talk) I wanna talk as much as I want
(I'm gonna give) I'm gonna give the problem to you
(I wanna talk) I wanna talk as much as I want
(I'm gonna give) I'm gonna give the problem to you
