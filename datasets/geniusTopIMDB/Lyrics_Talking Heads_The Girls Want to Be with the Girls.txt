The Girls Want to Be with the Girls Lyrics
Girls don't want to play like that
Just want to talk to the boys
Just want to do what's in their hearts
And the girls want to be with the girls

And the boys say, "What do you mean?"
And the boys say, "What do you mean?"
Well, there's just no love
When there's boys and girls
And the girls want to be with the girls
Girls want to be with the girls
Girls want things that make common sense
The best for all concerned
Don't want to have to go out of their way
And the girls want to be with the girls

Girls are getting into abstract analysis
Would like to make that intuitive leap
They're making plans that have far-reaching effects
And the girls want to be with the girls

And the boys say, "What do you mean?"
And the boys say, "What do you mean?"
Well, there's just no love
When there's boys and girls
And the girls want to be with the girls
Yes, the girls want to be with the girls
Watch when they goYou might also likeEmbed
