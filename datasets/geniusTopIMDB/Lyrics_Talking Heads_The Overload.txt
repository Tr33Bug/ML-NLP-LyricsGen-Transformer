The Overload Lyrics
A terrible signal
Too weak to even recognize
A gentle collapsing
The removal of the insides
I'm touched by your pleas
I value these moments
We're older than we realize
In someone's eyes

A frequent returning
And leaving unnoticed
A condition of mercy
A change in the weather
A view to remember
The center is missing
They question how the future lies
In someone's eyes
The gentle collapsing
Of every surface
We travel on the quiet road
