Wild Wild Life LyricsI'm wearing fur pajamas
I ride a hot potato
Itâ€™s tickling my fancy
Speak up, I can't hear you
Here on this mountain top, oh-oh-oh
I got some wild, wild life
I got some news to tell you, oh-oh
About some wild, wild life
Here come the doctor in charge, oh-oh-oh
She's got some wild, wild life
Ain't that the way you like it, oh-oh?
Living wild, wild life
I wrestle with your conscience
You wrestle with your partner
Sitting on a windowsill
But he spends his time behind closed doors
So check out mister businessman, oh-oh-oh
He bought some wild, wild life
On the way to the stock exchange, oh-oh-oh
He got some wild, wild life
Break it up when he opens the door, oh-oh-oh
He doing wild, wild life
I know it's the way you like it, oh-oh
Living wild, wild
Peace of mind?
It's a piece of cake
Thought control
You get on board any time you like
Like sitting on pins and needles
Things fall apart
It's scientific
Sleeping on the Interstate, oh-oh-oh
Getting wild, wild life
Checking in and checking out, oh-oh-oh
I got 'em, wild, wild life
Spending all of my money and time, oh-oh-oh
On too much wild, wild life
We wanna go, and we go where we go, oh-oh-oh
Ah, doing wild, wild life
I know it, that's how we start, oh-oh-oh
Got some wild, wild life
Take a picture here in the daylight, oh-oh
And it's a wild, wild life
You've grown so tall, you've grown so fast, oh-oh-oh
Wild, wild
And I know that's the way you like it, oh-oh
Living wild, wild, wild, wild lifeYou might also like2Embed
