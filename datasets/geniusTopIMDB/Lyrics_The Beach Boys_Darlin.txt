Darlinâ€™ Lyrics
(Oh, keep dreamin' of darlin')
(Ooh-ooh, my darlin', you're so fine)
(Oh, oh, oh)

Don't know if words could say
But darlin', I'll find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part
Oh, darlin' (Oh, keep dreamin' of darlin')
I dream about you often my pretty darlin'
(Ooh-ooh, my darlin', you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh, oh

I was livin' like half a man
Then I couldn't love, but now I can
You pick me up when I'm feelin' sad
More soul than I ever had
Gonna love you every single night
'Cause I think you're too outta sight

Oh-oh, darlin' (Oh, keep dreamin' of darlin')
I dream about you often my pretty darlin'
(Ooh-ooh, my darlin', you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh-huh

Woah, oh-oh-oh
Every night, oh, darlin'
You might also like
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
'Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight

Darlin' (Oh, keep dreamin' of darlin')
I dream about you often my pretty darlin'
(Ooh-ooh, my darlin', you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love, uh-huh, oh2Embed
