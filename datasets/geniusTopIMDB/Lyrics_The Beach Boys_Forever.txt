Forever Lyrics
If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever (Together, my love)
I ask the sky just what we had
It shone forever
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever (Together, my love)

Forever, forever
I've been so happy loving you
Together, my love
Let the love I have for you
Live in your heart
And beat forever (Together, my love)

Forever, forever
I've been so happy loving you

Baby, just let me sing it, my baby
I want to be singing, my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, my baby
I want to be singing, my baby

So I'm going away
But not forever
I'm gonna love you in your way
