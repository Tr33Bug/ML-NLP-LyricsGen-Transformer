God Only Knows Lyrics
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
God only knows what I'd be without you

Ooh, ooh
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)You might also like23Embed
