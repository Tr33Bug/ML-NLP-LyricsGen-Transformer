I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times Lyrics
I keep looking for a place to fit in
Where I can speak my mind
And I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind
They say I got brains but they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong
Sometimes I feel very sad (¿Cuándo seré?)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Un día seré, Ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Oh, ¿cuando seré? Ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out?
What's it all about?

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad (¿Cuándo seré?)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Un día seré, ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Oh, ¿cuándo seré? Ain't found the right thing  I can put my heart and soul into)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
