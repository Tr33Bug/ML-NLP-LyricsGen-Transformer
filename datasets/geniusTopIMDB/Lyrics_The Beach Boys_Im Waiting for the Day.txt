Iâ€™m Waiting for the Day Lyrics
I came along when he broke your heart
That's when you needed someone to help forget about him
I gave you love with a brand new start
That's what you needed the most to set your broken heart free

I know you cried, and you felt blue
But when I could, I gave strength to you
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again
I kissed your lips and when your face looked sad
It made me think about him and that you still loved him so
(Baby, don't you know) That pretty soon, I made you feel glad
That you belonged to me and love began to show

He hurt you then, but that's all gone
I guess I'm saying you're the only one
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again


He hurt you then, but that's all done
I guess I'm saying you're the only one
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again

You didn't think, no, that I could sit around and let him work
You didn't think, no, that I could sit around and watch him take you
You didn't think that I could sit around and watch him go
You didn't think that I could sit back and let you go
You didn't think that I could sit around and let you goYou might also like4Embed
