In My Room Lyrics

There's a world where I can go
And tell my secrets to

In my room
In my room (In my room)

In this world I lock out
All my worries and my fears
In my room
In my room (In my room)

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone
But I won't be afraid

In my room
In my room (In my room, in my room)
In my room (In my room, in my room)You might also like2Embed
