Little Saint Nick (1991 Remix) Lyrics
Oooo Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Oooo

Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick (Ooo)
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick (Ooo)
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel (Ooo)
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel (Ooo)

It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer (Woah, woah-oh)
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

And hauling through the snow at a frightening speed (Ooo)
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead (Ooo)
He's gotta wear his goggles because the snow really flies (Ooo)
And he's cruising every pad with a little surprise (Ooo)
You might also like
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each yearEmbed
