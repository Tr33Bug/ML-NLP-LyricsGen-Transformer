Long Promised Road Lyrics
So hard to answer future's riddle when ahead is seeming so far behind
So hard to laugh a child-like giggle when the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Sew up the wounds of evolution and the now starts to get in my way
So what if life's a revelation if the mind speaks of only today
So real, the pain of growing in soul
Of climbing up to reality's goal

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Long promised road
Trail starts at dawn, carries on to the season's ending
Long promised road
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending

So hard to lift the jeweled scepter when the weight turns a smile to a frown
So hard to drink of passion nectar when the taste of life's holding me down
So hard to plant the seed of reform
To set my sights on defeating the storm

So I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Oh yeah

Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down, whoo yeah
Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me, yeah
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
