Surfinâ€™ Lyrics
Surfing is the only life
The only way for me
Now surf, surf with me
Bom Bom Dit Di Dit Dip

I got up this morning turned on my radio
I was checking on the surfing scene
To see if I would go
And when the DJ tells me that the surfing is fine
That's when I know my baby and I will have a good time
We're going surfing
Bom bom dip di dit  - Surfing


From the early morning to the middle of the night
Any time the surf is up the time is right
And when the surf is down to take its place
We'll do the Surfer's Stomp it's the latest dance craze



Now the dawn is breaking and we really got to go
But we'll be back here very soon that you better know
Yeah my surfer knots are rising and my board is losing wax
But that won't stop me baby cause you know I'm coming back


Surfing is the only life the only way for me
Now come on pretty baby and surf with me
Bom bom dip di dit
