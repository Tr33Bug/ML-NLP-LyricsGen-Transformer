Thatâ€™s Not Me Lyrics
I had to prove that I could make it alone now
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
But that's not me

I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl

I'm a little bit scared 'cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time
My folks when I wrote them told 'em what I was up to
Said that's not me
I went through all kinds of changes, took a look at myself
And said that's not me

I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone
I would dream

I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready

I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so prettyYou might also like6Embed
