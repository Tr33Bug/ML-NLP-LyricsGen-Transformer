â€™Til I Die Lyrics
I'm a cork on the ocean
Floating over the raging sea
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
I lost my way, hey, hey, hey

I'm a rock in a landslide
Rolling over the mountainside
How deep is the valley?
How deep is the valley?
It kills my soul, hey, hey, hey
I'm a leaf on a windy day
Pretty soon, I'll be blown away
How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do
(Until I die) Until I die

These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die...You might also like1Embed
