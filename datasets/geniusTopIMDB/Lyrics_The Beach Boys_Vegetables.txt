Vegetables Lyrics
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table

If you brought a big brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vege-table
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet cause I'm so embarassed
Oh, yeah

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-table
I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in
Your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vege-tableYou might also like1Embed
