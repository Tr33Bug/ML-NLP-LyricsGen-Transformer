You Still Believe in Me Lyrics
I know perfectly well I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware you've been patient with me
Every time we break up, you bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you, how can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more what you want me to be
But I can't help how I act when you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong, but sometimes, I fail myself
And after all I've promised you so faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry
Cry
Ah
Ah
