Bankrobber/Robber Dub Lyrics
My daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money

Some is rich, and some is poor
That's the way the world is
But I don't believe in lyin' back
Sayin' how bad your luck is
So we came to jazz it up
We never loved a shovel
Break your back to earn our pay
An' don't forget to grovel
The old man spoke up in a bar
Said "I never been in prison
A lifetime serving one machine
Is ten times worse than prison"
Imagine if all the boys in jail
Could get out now together
Whadd'ya think they'd want to say to us?
While we was bein' clever
Someday you'll meet your rockin' chair
'Cause that's where we're spinnin'
There's no point to wanna comb your hair
When it's grey and thinning

So we came to jazz it up
We never loved a shovel
Break your back to earn our pay
An' don't forget to grovel

Hey
Get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get away

Run rabbit run
Strike out boys, for the hills
I can find that hole in the wall
And I know that they never willYou might also like3Embed
