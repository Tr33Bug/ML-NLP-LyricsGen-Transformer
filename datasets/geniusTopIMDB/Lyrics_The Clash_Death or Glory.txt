Death or Glory Lyrics
Hey

Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
And ends up makin' payments on a sofa or a girl
"Love" and "hate" tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand how

Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
In every gimmick hungry yob diggin' gold from rock 'n' roll
Grabs the mic and tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
He who fucks nuns will later join the church

Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story

Fear in the gun sights
They say "Lie low"
You say "Ok"
Don't wanna play a show
No other thinking
Was it death or glory now?
Playin' the blues of kings
Sure looks better now

Death or glory, just another story
Death or glory, just another story

In every dingy basement on every dingy street
Every draggin' handclap over every draggin' beat
That's just the beat of time, beat that must go on
If you've been tryin' for years we already heard your song
You might also like
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory, just another story

Gotta march a long way
Fight a long time
Get to travel over mountains
Got to travel over seas
We gonna fight you, brother
We gonna fight 'til you lose
We gonna raise trouble
We gonna raise hell
We gonna fight you, brother
Raise hell

Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory, just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story7Embed
