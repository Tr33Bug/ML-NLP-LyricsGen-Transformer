Hateful Lyrics
Well, I got a friend who's a man (who's a man)
What man? The man who keeps me from the lonely
The only
He gives me what I need (what you need?)
What you got? I need it all so badly

Oh, anything I want, he gives it to me
Anything I want, he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for
And I'm so grateful to be nowhere
This year I've lost some friends (some friends)
What friends? I dunno, I didn't even notice
You see, I gotta go out again (again)
My friend, I gotta see that main man
Hey

Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want, he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for
And I'm so grateful to be nowhere

Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want, he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for
And I'm so grateful to be nowhere

I killed all my nerves (my nerves)
What swerves? I can't drive so steady
And already
I've lost my memory (my mind)
Behind, I can't see so clearly

Oh, anything I want, he gives it to me
Anything I want, he gives it, but not for free
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me (Anything I want)
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free (Anything I want)
Anything I want, anything I want1Embed
