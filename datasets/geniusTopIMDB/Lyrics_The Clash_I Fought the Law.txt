I Fought the Law Lyrics
Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

I left my baby and it feels so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a
Robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I lost my girl and I lost my fun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

I left my baby and it feels so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a

I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'aYou might also like7Embed
