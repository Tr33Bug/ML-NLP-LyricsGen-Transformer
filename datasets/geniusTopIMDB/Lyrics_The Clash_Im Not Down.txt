Iâ€™m Not Down Lyrics
If it's true a rich man leads a sad life
That's what they say from day to day
Then what do all the poor do with their lives
On judgment day, when nothin' is saved?

I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, no I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, no I'm not down
On my own, I faced a gang of jeering
In strange streets, oh
When my nerves were pumping and I fought my fear in
I didn't run, I was not done

I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, no I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, no I'm not down

'Cause I've lived that kind of day
When none of your sorrows will go away
It goes down and down and hit the floor
Down and down and down some more
Depression
But I know there'll be some way
When I can swing everything back my way
Like skyscrapers rising up
Floor by floor, not giving up

So you rock around and think that you're the toughest
In the world, the whole wide world
But you're streets away from where it gets the roughest
You ain't been there
You might also like
I've been beat up, I've been thrown out
But I'm not down, no I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, no I'm not down

I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
No, I'm not down
I'm not downEmbed
