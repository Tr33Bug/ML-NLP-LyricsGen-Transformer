Jimmy Jazz Lyrics
Police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said "He ain't here, but he sure went by"
Oh, you're lookin' for Jimmy Jazz
Satta Massagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and chop off his head
Police come look for Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz
So if you're gonna take a message 'cross the town
Maybe put it down somewhere over the other side
See it gets to Jimmy Jazz

So tell me now!
The police came in they said "Now where's Jimmy Jazz?"
I said, "Hmm, he was here but, um, he said he went out"
Who is it you're lookin' for? Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz
Hey, Satta Massagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and they'll chop off his head
Oh, you're lookin' for Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz
What a relief!
I feel like a soldier
Look like a thief!
It's for the Jazz, Jazz
Police a-come a-lookin' for the Jimmy Jazz
He came in and he went past
Oh, you're lookin' for the Jimmy Jazz, Jimmy Jazz
In fact, don't you bother me, not anymore
I can't take this tale, oh, no more
It's all around, Jimmy Jazz, Jazz
J-a-zee zee J-a-zed zed
J-a-zee zee J-a-zed zed
J-a-zed zed Jimmy Jazz
And then it sucks, he said, "Suck that!"
So go look all around
You can try your luck, brother, and see what ya' found
But I guarantee you that it ain't your day, your day
It ain't your day
