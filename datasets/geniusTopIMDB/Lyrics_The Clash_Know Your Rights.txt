Know Your Rights Lyrics
This is a public service announcement... with guitar!

Know your rights
All three of 'em

Number one
You have the right not to be killed
Murder is a crime
Unless it was done
By a Policeman
Or an aristocrat
Oh, know your rights

And Number two
You have the right to food money
Providing of course you
Don't mind a little
Investigation, humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Rehabilitation

Know your rights
These are your rights!
Hey, say, Wang

Oh, know these rights

Number three
You have the right to free speech
As long as you're not
Dumb enough to actually try it
You might also like
Know your rights
These are your rights
Oh, know your rights
These are your rights
All three of 'em, ha

And it has been suggested
In some quarters that this is not enough
Well, get off the streets
Get off the streets!2Embed
