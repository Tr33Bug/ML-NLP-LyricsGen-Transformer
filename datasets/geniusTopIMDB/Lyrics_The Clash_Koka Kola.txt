Koka Kola Lyrics
Elevator! Goin' up!

In the gleamin' corridor of the 51st floor
The money can be made if you really want some more
Executive decision, at clinical precision
Jumping from the windows, filled with indecision

I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice, party girl
Coke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You don't need a launderette, you can take 'em to the vet!

I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice, party girl
Coke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze

Coca-Cola advertising and cocaine
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain
Neon light sign says it
I read it in the paper, they're crazy
Yeah, suit your life, maybe so
In the White House, I know
All over Berlin, they do it for years
And in Manhattan

Comin' through the door is a snub nose forty four
The barrel can't snort, it can spatter on the floor
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs
And your tongue feels like a fish
You're leapin' from the windows sayin'
"Don't give me none of this!"
You might also like
Coke adds life, advertising world
Treat me nice, party girl
Coke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze

Hit the deck!1Embed
