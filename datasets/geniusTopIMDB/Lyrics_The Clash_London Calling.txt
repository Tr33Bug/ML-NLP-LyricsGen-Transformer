London Calling Lyrics
London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come outta' the cupboard, ya' boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin' thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
Cause London is drownin', I, live by the river
(London calling) to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holdin' out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't want to shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out
London calling, see we ain't got no Hyde
'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river


The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

Now get this
You might also like
(London calling), yes, I was there, too
And ya' know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
(London calling) at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
(London calling)

I never felt so much alike alike alike...36Embed
