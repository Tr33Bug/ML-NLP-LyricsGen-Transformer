Londonâ€™s Burning Lyrics
London's burning
London's burning

All across the town, all across the night
Everybody's drivin' with full headlights
Black or white you turn it on, you face the new religion
Everybody's sittin' 'round watching television

London's burning (With boredom now)
London's burning (Dial 99999)
London's burning (With boredom now)
London's burning (Dial 99999)
I'm up and down the Westway, in and out the lights
What a great traffic system, it's so bright
I can't think of a better way to spend the night
Than speedin' around underneath the yellow lights

London's burning (With boredom now)
London's burning (Dial 99999)
London's burning (With boredom now)
London's burning (Dial 99999)

Now I'm in the subway and I'm lookin' for the flat
This one leads to this block, this one leads to that
The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home
I run through the empty stone because I'm all alone

London's burning (With boredom now)
London's burning (Dial 99999)
London's burning (With boredom now)
London's burning (Dial 99999)

Here we go
Yeah, here we are riding along the West London motorway
On your left we see the tower blocks built in 1963
With a massive repair bill for the GLC
And over there you see Westbourne Park
They don't want a traffic system to park the car
