Lost in the Supermarket Lyrics
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

I wasn't born, so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see
I heard the people who live on the ceiling
Scream and fight, most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feelin'
That's how it's been, all around me
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

I'm all tuned in, I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit, discotheque album
I empty a bottle, I feel a bit free
The kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

And it's not here
It disappeared

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily

I'm all lost in the supermarket

I'm all lost

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
