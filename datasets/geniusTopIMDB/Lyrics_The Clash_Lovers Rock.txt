Loverâ€™s Rock Lyrics
(Two, three, four)

Yeah, you must treat your lover girl right
If you wanna make lover's rock
You must know the place you can kiss
To make lover's rock
Everybody knows it's a cryin' shame
But nobody knows the poor baby's name
But she forgot that thing that she had
(Ohh) To swallow
You Western man, you're free with your seed
When you make lover's rock
But woops there goes the strength that you need
To make real cool lover's rock
A genuine lover takes off his clothes
And he can make a lover in a thousand goes
But she don't need that thing that she had
(Ohh) To swallow
(Know what I mean?)

Yeah, you must treat your lover girl right
To make lover's rock
You must know the place you can kiss
To make lover's rock
Everybody knows it's a crying shame
But nobody knows the poor baby's name
When she forgot that thing that she had
(Ohh) To swallow

Yeah you throw away all your human theories
Once, you lost that grubby feeling
Yeah hey!
(They call it lover's rock)
Ridiculous innit?
But that's what they call it
(They call it lover's rock)
So, follow me now
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
On the floor now
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
Throw your dollars!
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
(They call it lover's rock)
It's enormous!
