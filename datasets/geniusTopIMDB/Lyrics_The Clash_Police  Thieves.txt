Police & Thieves Lyrics
They're going through a tight wind

Police and thieves in the street (Oh yeah)
Scarin' the nation with their guns and ammunition
Police and thieves in the streets (Oh yeah)
Fightin' the nation with their guns and ammunition
From genesis to revelation
The next generation will be, hear me
From genesis to revelation
The next generation will be, hear me
And all the crowd come in, a-day by day
No one stops it in anyway
All the peacemaker, third world officer
Hear what I say

Police and thieves in the street (Oh yeah)
Scarin' the nation with their guns and ammunition
Police and thieves in the street (Oh yeah)
Fightin' the nation with their guns and ammunition
From genesis to revelation
The next generation will be, hear me
(Oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)

And all the crowd come in, day by day
No one stop it in anyway
All the peacemaker, third world officer
Hear what I say

Police, police, police and thieves (Oh yeah)
Police, police, police and thieves (Oh yeah)
From genesis (Oh yeah)
Police, police, police, police and thieves, oh yeah

And I'm scarin', I'm fightin' the nation (Oh yeah)
Shootin', shootin' their guns and, guns and ammunition (Oh yeah)

Here come, here come, here come
The station is bombed (Oh yeah)
Get out, get out, get out, you people
If you don't want to get blown up (Oh yeah)
The police, the police and the thieves (Oh yeah)
You gotta lick the ground
But you are trapped in the middle, punk

Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police
Police, police, police, police2Embed
