Police on My Back Lyrics
Well, I'm a-runnin'
Police on my back
I've been hidin'
Police on my back
There was a shootin'
Police on my back
And the victim
Well, he won't come back

I've been runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done? What have I done?
Yes, I'm runnin'
Down the railway track
Won't you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me
If I dare drop back
Won't you give me
All the speed I lack?

I've been runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Runnin' Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done? What have I done?

I'm runnin'
I'm runnin'
I keep runnin'

Yes, I'm runnin'
Down the railway track
Won't you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me
If I dare drop back
Won't you help me
Find the speed I lack?
