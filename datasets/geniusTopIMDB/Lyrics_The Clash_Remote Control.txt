Remote Control Lyrics
Who needs remote control
From the Civic Hall?
Push a button
Activate
You gotta work
You're late

It's so grey in London town
Panda car crawlin' around
Here it comes
Eleven o'clock
Where can we go now?
Can't make no noise
Can't get no gear
Can't make no money
Can't get outta here

Big business, it don't like you
Don't like the things you do
They got no money
They got no power
They think you're useless
And so you are, punk

They had a meeting in Mayfair
They got you down and they wanna keep you there
It makes them worried
Their bank accounts
That's all that matters
You don't count

Can't make no progress
Can't get ahead
Can't stop the regress
Don't wanna be dead
You might also like
(Look out those rules and regulations)

Who needs the Parliament?
Sittin' makin' laws all day
They're all fat and old
Queuein' for the House of Lords
Repression (Gonna start on Tuesday)
Repression (Gonna be a Dalek)
Repression (I am a robot)
Repression (I obey)1Embed
