Revolution Rock Lyrics
Revolution rock
It is a brand new rock
A bad, bad rock
This here revolution rock

Careful how you move, Mac, you dig me in me back
And I'm so pilled up that I rattle
I have got the sharpest knife, so I cut the biggest slice
I got no time to do battle
Hey, everybody smash up your seats
And rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa
Everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock
I am in a state of shock
So bad, bad rock
This here revolution rock

Careful how you slide, Clyde
All you did was glide
And you poured your beer in me hat
Keep my good eye on the beat
Living on fixation street
I ain't got no time for that

Everybody smash up your seats
And rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mama, tell your pa
Everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright
You might also like
Revolution rock
Yeah so, get that cheese grater going
Against the grains
Wearin' me down
Pressure increase
Everybody!

Everybody smash up your seats
And rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mama, tell your father
Everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Gonna be alright

Revolution rock
To the coolest mobsters in Kingstown
With the hardest skies
And the cruelest songs
Is your heart so made of rock
That the blood must run 'round the block?
Are you listenin' mobsters?
Yeah
All people crawl, gotta die
While cart of food goes rolling by
It's food for thought mobsters
Young people shoot their days away
I've seen talent thrown away
On your loan shark
The organ play!
And they're dancin' to the brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mamamama, tell your papapapa
Everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it
Everything is gonna be alright
I said revolution rock

This old cheese grater
Runnin' me down
This must be the way out
Here's a cheap bit
Any song you want
Playin' requests now in the bandstand
El Clash Combo
Paid fifteen dollars a day
Weddings, parties, anything
And Bongo Jazz, a specialty1Embed
