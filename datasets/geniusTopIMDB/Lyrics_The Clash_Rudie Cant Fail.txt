Rudie Canâ€™t Fail Lyrics
Now sing, Michael, sing
On the route of the 19 Bus
We hear them sayin'

How you get so rude and'a reckless?
Don't you be so crude and'a feckless
You been drinkin' brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail, no, no
(We reply)
I know that my life makes you nervous
But I tell you that I can't live in service
Like the doctor who's born for a purpose
Rudie can't fail
(Ok)
I went to the market to realize (my soul)
What I need (I just don't have) (Oh no)
First they curse, then they press me 'til I hurt
(He say) Rudie can't fail

First you must cure your temper
Then find a job in a paper
You need someone for a saviour
Rudie can't fail
(We reply)
Now we get a'rude and a'reckless
To been seen looking cool and speckless
An' drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail (oh no, no)

I went to the market to realize (my soul)
'Cause what I need (I just don't have) (Have)
First they curse, then they press me 'til I hurt
Rudie can't fail

Ok, ok
So where you wanna go today?
Hey, boss man, huh, yeah
So you're looking pretty smart (Chicken skin suit) with a chicken skin suit
You think you're pretty hot (Pork pie hat) in your pork pie hat
