Safe European Home Lyrics
Well, I just got back an I wish I never leave now
(Where'd ya' go?)
Who that Martian arrival at the airport, yeah?
(Where'd ya' go?)
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic?
(Where'd ya' go?)
The Johnny on the corner wasn't very sympathetic
(Where'd ya' go?)

I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An' sitting here in my safe European home
Don't wanna go back there again
Wasn't I lucky, wouldn't it be lovely?
(Where'd ya' go?)
Send us all cards and have a lay in on Sunday
(Where'd ya' go?)
I was there for two weeks, so how come I never tell now?
(Where'd ya' go?)
That natty dread drinks at the Sheraton Hotel, yeah?
(Where'd ya' go?)

I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An' sitting here in my safe European home
Don't wanna go back there again


They got the sun and they got the palm trees
(Where'd ya' go?)
They got the weed and they got the taxis
(Where'd ya' go?)
Whoa, "The Harder They Come" and the home of ol' Bluebeat
(Where'd ya' go?)
I'd stay and be a tourist but I can't take the gun play
(Where'd ya'?)
You might also like
I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An' sitting here in my safe European home
Don't wanna go back there again
