Spanish Bombs Lyrics
Spanish songs in Andalucía
The shooting site in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Federico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón
Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag, they wore the black one
After they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My señorita's rose was nipped in the bud

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón

The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets, the ragged army
Fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearin' music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

Yo te acuerda oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh, mi corazón

Oh, mi corazón
Oh, mi corazón
Spanish songs in Andalucía
Mandolina, oh, mi corazón
Spanish songs in Granada
Oh, mi corazón
Oh, mi corazón
Oh, mi corazón
Oh, mi corazón19Embed
