Stay Free Lyrics
We met when we were at school
Never took no shit from no one, we weren't fools
The teacher says we're dumb, we're only havin' fun
You know we piss on everyone in the classroom

When we got thrown out I left without much fuss
And weekends we'd go dancin' down Streatham on the bus
You always made me laugh, got me in bad fights
Play me pool all night, smokin' menthols
I practiced daily in my room
You were down the Crown plannin' your next move
Go on a nickin' spree, hit the wrong guy
Each of you get three years in Brixton

I did my very best to write
How was Butlins? Were the screws too tight?
When you lot get out were gonna hit the town
We'll burn it fucking down to a cinder

'Cause years have passed and things have changed
And I move anyway I want to go
And I'll never forget the feelin' I got
When I heard that you'd got home

And I'll never forget the smile on my face
'Cause I knew where you would be
And if you're in the Crown tonight have a drink on me
But go easy
Step lightly, yeah
