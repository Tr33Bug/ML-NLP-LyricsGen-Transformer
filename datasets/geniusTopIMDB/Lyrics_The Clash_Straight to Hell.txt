Straight to Hell Lyrics
If you can play on fiddle
How's about a British jig and reel?
Speaking King's English in quotation
As railhead towns feel the steel mills rust
Water froze in the generation
Clear as winter ice
This is your paradise

There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Wanna join in a chorus
Of the Amerasian blues?
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa papa-san take me home
See me got photo photo
Photograph of you
And Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Of you and Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Let me tell you 'bout your blood bamboo kid
It ain't Coca-Cola, it's rice

Straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

Oh Papa-san
Please take me home
Oh Papa-san
Everybody they wanna go home
So Mamma-san says

You might also like
You wanna play mind-crazed banjo
On the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?
In Parkland International
Ha, Junkiedom U.S.A
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says

Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Straight to hell

Can you cough it up loud and strong?
The immigrants
They wanna sing all night long
It could be anywhere
Most likely could be any frontier
Any hemisphere
No man's land
There ain't no asylum here
King Solomon he never lived 'round here

Straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Oh Pappa-san, please take me home
Everybody they wanna go home now9Embed
