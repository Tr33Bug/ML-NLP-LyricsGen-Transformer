The Right Profile Lyrics
Say, where did I see this guy?

In Red River?
Or A Place in the Sun?
Maybe The Misfits?
Or From Here to Eternity?

And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
And everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!
New York, (New York) New York, 42nd Street
Hustlers rustle and pimp pimp the beat
Monty Clift is recognized at dawn
He ain't got no shoes and his clothes are torn

And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's just Montgomery Clift, honey!

I see a car smashed at night
Cut the applause and dim the light
Monty's face is broken on a wheel
Is he alive? Can he still feel?

And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "Shine the light!"
Everybody say, "It's not funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

Shoot his right profile
You might also like
Everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

Nembutal
Numbs it all
But I prefer
Alcohol

And everybody say, "What's he like?"
And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
That's Montgomery Clift, honey!

He said, "Go out and get me my old movie stills
Go out and get me another roll of pills
Everything's shakin', but I ain't got the chills"

And everybody say, "What's he like?"
And everybody say, "Is he all right?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny"
"I was trapped!" Montgomery Clift, honey!3Embed
