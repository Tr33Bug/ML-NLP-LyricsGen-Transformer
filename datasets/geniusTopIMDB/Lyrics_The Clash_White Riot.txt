White Riot Lyrics
One, two, three, four

White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

Black man got a lotta problems
But they don't mind throwin' a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be thick
And everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail

White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it

And everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail

White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
You might also like
Hey, you, standing in line
Are we gonna sign an agreement?

White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own1Embed
