Wrong â€™Em Boyo Lyrics
Stagger Lee met Billy and they got down to gambling
Stagger Lee throwed seven, Billy said that he throwed eight, hey
So Billy said, "Hey Stagger! I'm gonna make my big attack
I'm gonna have to leave my knife in your back"
(C'mon, let's start all over again)

Why do you try to cheat?
And trample people under your feet
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat the tryin' man
But you better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo
You lie, steal, cheat and deceit
In such a small, small game
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat the tryin' man
You better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo

Billy Boy has been shot
And Stagger Lee's come out on top
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat Stagger man
You'd better stop (you better stop)
Hey! It is the wrong 'em boyo, hey

So you must start all over again
All over again
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) Play it, Billy, play
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) Well, play it, Billy, play
An' you will find
It is the right 'em boyo

But if you must lie and deceit
And trample people under your feet
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?) To cheat a tryin' man
You better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo
