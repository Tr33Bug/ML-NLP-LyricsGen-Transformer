Hyacinth House Lyrics
What are they doing in the Hyacinth House?
What are they doing in the Hyacinth House?
To please the lions, yeah
This day

I need a brand new friend who doesn't bother me
I need a brand new friend who doesn't trouble me
I need someone, yeah
Who doesn't need me
I see the bathroom is clear
I think that somebody's near
I'm sure that someone is following me, oh yeah
Yeah
Why did you throw the Jack of Hearts away?
Why did you throw the Jack of Hearts away?
It was the only card in the deck that I had left to play

And I'll say it again, I need a brand new friend
And I'll say it again, I need a brand new friend
And I'll say it again, I need a brand new friend
