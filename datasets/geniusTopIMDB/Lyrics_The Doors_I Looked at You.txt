I Looked at You Lyrics
I looked at you
You looked at me
I smiled at you
You smiled at me

And we're on our way
No we can't turn back, babe
Yeah, we're on our way
And we can't turn back
Because it's too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late

And we're on our way
No we can't turn back, babe
Yeah, we're on our way
And we can't turn back, yeah
C'mon, yeah!

I walked with you
You walked with me
I talked to you
You talked to me

And we're on our way
No we can't turn back, babe
Yeah, we're on our way
And we can't turn back

Because it's too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late

And we're on our way
No we can't turn back, babe
Yeah, we're on our way
And we can't turn back

Because it's too late
Too late, too late
Too late, too late2Embed
