Love Me Two Times Lyrics
Love me two times, baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times, girl
I'm goin' away

Love me two times, girl
One for tomorrow
One just for today
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time
Yeah, my knees got weak

But love me two times, girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
All right, yeah!


Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time, baby
Yeah, my knees got weak

Love me two time, girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
