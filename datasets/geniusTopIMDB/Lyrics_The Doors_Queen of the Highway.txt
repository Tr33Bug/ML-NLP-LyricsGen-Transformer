Queen of the Highway Lyrics
She was a princess
Queen of the highway
Sign on the road said:
"Take us to Madre"
No one could save her
Save the blind tiger
He was a monster
Black dressed in leather
She was a princess
Queen of the Highway
Now they are wedded
She is a good girl
Naked as children
Out in a meadow
Naked as children
Wild as can be
Soon to have offspring
Start it all over
Start it all over

American boy
American girl
Most beautiful people
In the world
Son of a frontier
Indian Swirl
Dancing through the midnight
Whirl-pool
Formless
Hope it can continue
A little while longer, c'monYou might also like9Embed
