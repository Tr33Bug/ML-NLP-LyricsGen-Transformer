Shaman’s Blues Lyrics
There will never be another one like you
There will never be another one who can
Do the things you do, oh

Will you give another chance?
Will you try a little try?
Please stop and you'll remember
We were together
Anyway, alright
And if you have a certain evening
You could lend to me
I'd give it all right back to you
A-how it has to be with you
I know your moves and your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind


Will you stop and think and wonder
Just what you'll see?
Out on the train yard
Nursing penitentiary
It's gone, I cry out long
Go'head, brother


Did you stop it to consider
How it will feel?
Cold, grinding grizzly bear jaws
Hot on your heels
Do you often stop and whisper?
It's Saturday's shore
The whole world's a savior
Who could ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Ask for more?
Do you remember?
You might also like
Will you stop?
Will you stop—the pain?

And there will never be another one like you
There will never be another one who can
Do the things you do, oh

Will you give another chance?
Will you try a little try?
Please stop and you'll remember
We were together
Anyway, alright

How you must've think and wondered
How I must feel
Out on the meadows
While you run the field
I'm alone for you
And I cry

The sweat, look at it
Optical promise
Hahaha
You'll be dead and in hell
Before I'm born
Sure thing
Bridesmaid
The only solution
Isn't it amazing?1Embed
