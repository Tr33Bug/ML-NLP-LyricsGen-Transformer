Tell All the People Lyrics
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me, follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Set them free, follow me down

You tell them they don't have to run
We're gonna pick up everyone
Come out and take me by my hand
Gonna bury all our troubles in the sand, oh yeah
Can't you see the wonder at your feet?
Your life's complete, follow me down
Can't you see me growing? Get your guns
The time has come to follow me down

Follow me across the sea
Where milky babies seem to be
Molded, flowing revelry
With the one that set them free

Tell all the people that you see
It's just me, follow me down

Tell all the people that you see
Follow me, follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free, follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
It's just me, follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me, follow me down
You might also like
Follow me down
You've got to follow me down
Follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
We'll be free, follow me down
Tell all the people you see
Follow me, got to follow me down...1Embed
