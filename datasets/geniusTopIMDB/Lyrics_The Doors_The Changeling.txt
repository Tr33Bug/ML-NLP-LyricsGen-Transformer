The Changeling Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Get loose

I live, uptown
I live, downtown
I live, all around
I had money, and I had none
I had money, and I had none
But I never been so broke that I couldn't leave, town

I'm a Changeling
See me change
I'm a Changeling
See me change
I'm the air you breathe
Food you eat
Friends your greet
In the sullen street, wow
See me change, see me change, get loose

I live, uptown
I live, downtown
I live, all around

I had money, yeah, and I had none
I had money, yeah, and I had none
But I never been so broke that I couldn't leave, town
You might also like

Well, I'm the air you breathe
Food you eat
Friends your greet
In the sullen street, wow

You gotta see me change
See me change
Yeah, I'm leaving town
On a midnight train
Gotta see me change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Woah, change, change, change4Embed
