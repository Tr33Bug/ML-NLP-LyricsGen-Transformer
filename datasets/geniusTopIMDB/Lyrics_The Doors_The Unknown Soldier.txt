The Unknown Soldier Lyrics
Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older
The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television, children fed
Unborn living, living dead
Bullet strikes the helmet's head
And it's all over for the unknown soldier
It's all over for the unknown soldier, uh uh
March!
Company, halt!
Present arms!
Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder
The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television, children fed
Bullet strikes the helmet's head

And it's all over
The war is over
It's all over
War is over

It's all over, baby!
All over, baby!
Oh all right, yeah!
All over, yeah ha ha!
All over!
All over, baby!
Oh, oh yeah!
All over
All over
