Wild Child Lyrics
All right

Wild child, full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face

Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
You're our child, screaming wild
An ancient lunatic reigns
In the trees of the night
With hunger at her heels
Freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Staring into the hollow idolâ€™s eye

Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face
Your cool face
Your cool face
You remember when we were in Africa?You might also like1Embed
