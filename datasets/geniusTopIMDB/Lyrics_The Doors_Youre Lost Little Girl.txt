Youâ€™re Lost Little Girl Lyrics
You're lost little girl
You're lost little girl
You're lost
Tell me who are you?

I think that you know what to do
Impossible? Yes, but it's true
I think that you know what to do, yeah
Sure that you know what to do
You're lost little girl
You're lost little girl
You're lost
Tell me who are you?

I think that you know what to do
Impossible? Yes, but it's true
I think that you know what to do, girl
Sure that you know what to do

You're lost little girl
You're lost little girl
