Bird Dog Lyrics
Johnny is a joker (He's a bird)
A very funny joker (He's a bird)
But when he jokes, my honey (He's a dog)
His jokin' ain't so funny (What a dog)
Johnny is a joker that's been tryin' to steal my baby (He's a bird dog)

Johnny sings a love song (Like a bird)
Sings the sweetest love song (You ever heard)
But when he sings to my gal (What a howl)
To me, he's just a wolf dog (On the prowl)
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy love my baby (He's a bird dog)
Hey bird dog, get away from my quail
Hey bird dog, you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog, you better leave my lovey dove alone
Hey bird dog, get away from my chick
Hey bird dog, you better get away quick
Bird dog, you better find a chicken little of your own

Johnny kissed the teacher (He's a bird)
He tip-toed up to reach her (He's a bird)
Well, he's a teacher's pet now (He's a dog)
What he wants he can get now (What a dog)
He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby (He's a bird dog)

Hey bird dog, get away from my quail
Hey bird dog, you're on the wrong trail
Bird dog, you better leave my lovey dove alone
Hey bird dog, get away from my chick
Hey bird dog, you better get away quick
Bird dog, you better find a chicken little of your own
