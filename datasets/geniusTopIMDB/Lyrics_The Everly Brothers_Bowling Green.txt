Bowling Green LyricsWay down in Bowling Green
Prettiest girls I've ever seen
A man in Kentucky
Sure is lucky
To love down in Bowling Green
Bowling Green folks treat you kind
They let you think your own mind
A man in Kentucky
Sure is lucky
In Bowling Green you walk your own line
Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold
It warms the body
And I know it touches the soul
Bluegrass is fine
Kentucky owns my mind
The fields down in Bowling Green
Have the softest grass I've ever seen
A man in Kentucky
Sure is lucky
To lie down in Bowling Green
Bowling Green girls treat you right
They wear dresses cut country tight
A man in Kentucky
Sure is lucky
If he's seen a Bowling Green night
Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold
It warms the body
And I know it touches the soul
Bluegrass is fine
Kentucky owns my mind
Bowling Green, Bowling Green
Bowling Green, Bowling Green
