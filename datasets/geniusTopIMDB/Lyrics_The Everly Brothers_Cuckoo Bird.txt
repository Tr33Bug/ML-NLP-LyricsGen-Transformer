Cuckoo Bird Lyrics
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July

It is often that I wonder
Why women love men
And I look back and I wonder
Why men are men
Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July

Gonna build me a castle
On a mountain so high
So I can see my true love
As she passes by

Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July

Jack o' diamonds, jack o' diamonds
I know you of old
You have robbed me of my poor pockets
Of silver and gold

Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July
You might also like
I've gambled in England
And I've gambled down in Spain
I gambled with five aces
Now I've gambled my last game
Oh, it's gamblin' that's brought me prison
And it's gamblin' that's brought me pain
I'll never see the cuckoo
Or hear her song again

Oh the cuckoo, she's a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of JulyEmbed
