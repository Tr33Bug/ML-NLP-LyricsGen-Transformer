Ebony Eyes Lyrics(Oooooooooo)
On a weekend pass I wouldn't have had time
To get home and marry, that baby of mine
So I went to the Chaplain and he authorized
Me to send for my Ebony Eyes
My Ebony Eyes was coming to me
From out of the skies on Flight 1203
In an hour or two, I would whisper "I do"
To my beautiful Ebony Eyes
Spoken:
The plane was way overdue
So I went inside to the airline's desk and I said:
"Sir, I wonder why 1203 is so late"
He said: "Oh they probably took off late
Or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course"
I went back outside and waited at the gate
And I watched the beacon light from the control tower
As it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for â€“
My Ebony Eyes
And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker
"Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203
Please report to the chapel across the street at once"
Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my life's most wonderful prize
My beautiful Ebony Eyes
If I ever get, to heaven I'll bet
The first angel I'll recognise
She'll smile at me and I know she will be
My beautiful Ebony Eyes
