I’m Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail Lyrics"I'm not in your town to stay,"
Said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
"I'm not in your town to stay
And I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Oh warden
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail"
"I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
And I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden
At last I've found my baby here in jail"
"It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
T’was then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden
The county laid his daddy in the grave"
"I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
If that will get my baby out of jail"
Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray:
"I'll go bring your darling baby to your side"
Two iron gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling
She kissed her baby boy and then she died

Said a lady old and gray
"I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail"Embed
