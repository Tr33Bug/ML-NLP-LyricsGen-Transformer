Iâ€™m Not Angry LyricsI hope your radio won't play until I've had my say
I hope your mail always fails to reach you
Until you want to hear from me
I hope your wristwatch goes berserk
But I'm not angry, I'm just hurt
I hope your 'phone will never ring or your canary sing
I hope your car doesn't start, cannot move
Until you want to be with me
I hope your brand new dress gets torn
But I'm not angry, just forlorn
I'll make a voodoo doll, stuff it with bats and owls
He'll haunt your house, I'll rattle chains
We'll hang around until you call my name
And tell me that you want me back again
I hope your records always break, new shoes make your feet ache
I hope your luck will get stuck on black cats
Until you want a kiss from me
I hope your TV's always bad
But I'm not angry, I'm just sad
But I'm not angry, I'm just sad
But I'm not angry, I'm just sad
But I'm not angry, I'm just sad
But I'm not angry, I'm just sad
But I'm not angry, I'm just sad...You might also likeEmbed
