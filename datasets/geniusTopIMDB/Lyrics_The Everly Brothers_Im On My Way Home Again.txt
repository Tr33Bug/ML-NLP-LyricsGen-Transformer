Iâ€™m On My Way Home Again Lyrics
No, I don't think I'll ever get on a train again
I'll just smile and wave at the engineer
I'll put my guitar in a gunny sack
And walk away and I won't back
And when the whistle blows my name
I'll say
Whooo-oo-whooo
I'm on my way home again

No, I don't think I'll ever come this way again
I'll be content with the pictures in my mind
I'll remember how that lonesome road
Used to press my back like a heavy load
And when the diesel calls my name
I'll say
Whooo-oo-whooo
I'm on my way home again
Monday I'll just sit and look out the window
Tuesday I'll just spend the day drinking beer
Wednesday will find me asleep at the TV
The rest of the week will be free, free
No I don't think I'll ever get on a train again
I'll just smile and wave at the engineer
I'll put my guitar in a gunny sack
And walk away and I won't back
And when the whistle blows my name
I'll say
Whooo whooo
I'm on my way home again

I say
Whooo whooo
I'm on my way home again
Whooo whooo
I'm on my way home again
Whooo whooo
I'm on my way home again...You might also likeEmbed
