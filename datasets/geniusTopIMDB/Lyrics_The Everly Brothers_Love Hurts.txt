Love Hurts Lyrics
Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain

Love hurts
Love hurts
I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a stove
It burns you when it's hot

Love hurts
Love hurts

Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true
Know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
You might also like
Love hurts
Love hurts
