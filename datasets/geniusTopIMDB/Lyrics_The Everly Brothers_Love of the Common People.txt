Love of the Common People LyricsLiving on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do, hm hm hm
Tears from your little sister
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party to go
Oh but you know, she'll get by
Because she's
Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
Walking to town and find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
Boy you'd better go home, where it's warm
Where you can
Live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
And she can
Living on a dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
Ah you take 'em in stride, for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
Maybe a prayer
Making me strong where you belong
Where you can
Live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she canYou might also likeEmbed
