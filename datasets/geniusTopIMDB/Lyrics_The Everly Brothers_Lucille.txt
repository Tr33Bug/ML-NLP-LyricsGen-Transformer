Lucille LyricsLucille, you don't do your daddy's will
Lucille, you don't do your daddy's will
There's ain't nothing to you, but I love you still
Lucille, please come back where you belong
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I've been good to you, baby, please don't leave me alone
I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about her, all their lips were tight
Lucille, please come back where you belong
I've been good to you, baby, please don't leave me alone
Ooohhhhhh
Lucille, you don't do your daddy's will
Lucille, you don't do your daddy's will
There ain't nothing to you, but I love you still
