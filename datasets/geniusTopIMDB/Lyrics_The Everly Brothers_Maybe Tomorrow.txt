Maybe Tomorrow Lyrics
I know we'll love again
Maybe tomorrow
I don't know where or when
Maybe tomorrow

You say, you say you're gonna cry
Because they've made us say goodbye
Our love will stand their test of time
And our ages won't be there to draw the line
I know we'll love again
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
I don't know where or when
Maybe tomorrow
