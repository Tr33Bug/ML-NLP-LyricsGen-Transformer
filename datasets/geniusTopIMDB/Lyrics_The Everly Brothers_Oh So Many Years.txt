Oh So Many Years LyricsAll these many years I've loved you
No-one has ever known
No-one has ever known but you alone
I've kept it locked inside my heart
And smiled through all my tears
My darling, I have loved you oh so many years
Each night within my lonely room
I cry dear, over you
And pray to God that things will turn out right
But when the dawn of day appears
I brush away my tears
My darling, I have loved you oh so many years
I'll go on pretending that my life is oh so gay
And happy dear without you by my side
When all the time my heart is
Longing just to have you near
My darling I have loved you oh so many years
Maybe fate will lead us down a path where we will meet again
And then we will be free to love anew
Then one sweet kiss from your dear lips
Will banish all my fears
My darling I have loved you oh so many yearsYou might also likeEmbed
