Oh, What a Feeling LyricsIt must be love
Oh, what a feeling
I sit at home alone
I wait here by the phone
I know you'll never call
Oh, what a feeling
It must be love
Although it's bitter
It must be love
I canâ€™t forget her
The days turn into weeks
Your letters I shall keep
The ones you didn't write
Oh, what a feeling
It must be love
Oh, what a feeling
It must be love
Oh, what a feelingYou might also likeEmbed
