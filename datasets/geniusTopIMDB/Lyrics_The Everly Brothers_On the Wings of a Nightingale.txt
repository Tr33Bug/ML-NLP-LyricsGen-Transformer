On the Wings of a Nightingale LyricsWhen I love
I get a feeling like I'm travelling through the sky
On the wings of a nightingale
As I ride
My head is reeling but I don't even wonder why
On the wings of a nightingale I'll fly
High above land and sea
I'll be thinking of you and me
Couldn't ask for a better place to be
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening to me
So hold my hand
I got a feeling that the journey has just begun
On the wings of a nightingale
And if you like
We'll fly together to the land of eternal sun
On the wings of a nightingale of love
High above land and sea
I'll be thinking of you and me
Couldn't ask for a better place to be
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening
Oh, I can feel something happening to me
When I love
I get a feeling like I'm travelling through the sky
On the wings of a nightingale
On the wings of a nightingale
On the wings of a nightingale fly
On the wings of a nightingaleYou might also likeEmbed
