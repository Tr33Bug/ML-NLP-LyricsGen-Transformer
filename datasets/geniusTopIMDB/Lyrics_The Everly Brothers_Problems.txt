Problems LyricsProblems, problems, problems all day long
Will my problems work out right or wrong?
My baby don't like anything I do
My teacher seems to feel the same way too
Worries, worries pile up on my head
Woe is me, I should have stayed in bed
Can't get the car, my marks ain't been so good
My love life just ain't swingin' like it should
Problems, problems, problems
They're all on account-a my lovin' you like I do
Problems, problems, problems
They won't be solved until I'm sure of you
You can solve my problems with a love that's true
Problems, problems, problems all day long
Problems, problems, problems all day longYou might also likeEmbed
