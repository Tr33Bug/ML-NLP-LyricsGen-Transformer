Put My Little Shoes Away LyricsMother dear come bathe my forehead
For I’m growing very weak
Mother let one drop of water
Fall upon my burning cheek
I’m going away to leave you mother darling
And remember what I say
Do this won’t you please dear mother
Put my little shoes away
Santa Claus he brought them to me
With a lot of other things
I believe he brought an Angel
With a pair of golden wings
Tell my loving little playmates
That I never more will play
Give them all my toys but mother
Put my little shoes away
I’m going away to leave you mother darling
And remember what I say
Do this won’t you please dear mother
