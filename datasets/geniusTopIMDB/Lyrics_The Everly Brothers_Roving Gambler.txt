Roving Gambler LyricsI am a roving gambler, I've gambled down in town
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money down
I had not been in Washington, many more weeks than three
'Til I fell in love with a pretty little girl, she fell in love with me
Fell in love with me, fell in love with me
She took me in her parlour, she cooled me with her fan
She whispered low in her momma's ear, "I love that gambling man
Love that gamblin' man, love that gamblin' man"
"Daughter, oh dear daughter, how can you treat me so?
To leave your dear old mother, and with a gambler go?
With a gambler go, with a gambler go?"
I've gambled down in Washington; I've gambled down in Spain
I'm goin' down in Georgia to gamble my last game
Gamble my last game, gamble my last game
"Mother, oh dear mother, you know I love you well
But the love I have for the gambling man, no human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell, no human tongue can tell
I hear that train a-coming, coming 'round the curve
A-whistling and a-blowing straining every nerve
Strainin' every nerve, strainin' every nerve
"Mother, oh dear mother, I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see me comin' back, I'll be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man"
I am a roving gambler, I've gambled down in town
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards I lay my money down
Lay my money down, lay my money downYou might also likeEmbed
