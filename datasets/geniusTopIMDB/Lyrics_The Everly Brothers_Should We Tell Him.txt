Should We Tell Him LyricsHmHmHmHm
"Should we tell him?
To let him go on trusting isn't fair"

"Should we tell him
Should we tell him that his girl doesn't care?"
I took my best girl dancing
Down to my best friend's mansion
He met us at the door, said, "Glad you're here"
Before the dance was over
I saw him call her over
Then he whispered
Thought I didn't hear
"Should we tell him?
To let him go on trusting isn't fair"

"Should we tell him
Should we tell him that his girl doesn't care?"
I left them there together
Thought that I might feel better
Down at this caf√© where we used to go
Some of my friends had gathered
Just for some fun and laughter
Then I heard two of them a-talking low
"Should we tell him?
To let him go on trusting isn't fair"
