Since You Broke My Heart LyricsThey say the blues went out of style
To cry is to act just like a child
Smile each day that we're apart
But I can't agree I never will
Since you broke my heart
They say the best way's not to care
Just play a few hands of solitaire
Read a book or study art
All the remedies don't work for me
