So How Come (No One Loves Me) LyricsThey say that everyone needs someone
So how come no one needs me?
And they say that everyone wants someone
So how come no one wants me?
If you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
They're the Ugly Duckling, the Little Black Sheep, and me, uh-huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me?
If you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
They're the Ugly Duckling, the Little Black Sheep, and me, uh-huh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me?
So how come no one loves me?
So how come no one loves me?You might also likeEmbed
