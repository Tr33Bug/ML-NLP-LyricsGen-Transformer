Some Sweet Day LyricsSome sweet day
Some sweet day
I’m gonna hold you like I want to
I’m gonna kiss you like want to
I’m gonna love you like I need to
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
You will say
That you have started dreamin’ of me
That you love no one else above me
I’ll find a way to make you love me
Some sweet day
I hope it won’t be long till I can take and make you my very own
‘Cause baby doll, I get so tired of wishin' and dreamin’ alone
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
You’ll get that twinkle in your eye love
You gonna look at me and sigh love
And then you’ll tell me that you’re my love
Some sweet day
I hope won’t be long till I can take and make you my very own
‘Cause baby doll, I get so tired of wishin' and dreamin’ alone
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
You’ll get that twinkle in your eye love
You gonna look at me sigh love
And then you’ll tell me that you’re my love
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
