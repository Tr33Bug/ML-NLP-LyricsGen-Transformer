Temptation LyricsYea, yea, yea yeah
Yea, yea, yea yeah
Yea, yea, yea yeah
Oh ...
You came, I was alone
I should have known
You were temptation
You sighed, leading me on
I should have known
You were temptation
It would be thrilling, if you were willing
But if it can never be
Well then pity me
You were, born to be kissed
I can't resist
You are temptation
(I 'm yours, here is my heart
Take it and say, "We'll never part")
I'm just a slave
Only a slave
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Oh ...
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeah
Yea, yea, yea, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
