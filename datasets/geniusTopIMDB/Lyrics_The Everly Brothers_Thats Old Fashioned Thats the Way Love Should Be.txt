That’s Old Fashioned (That’s the Way Love Should Be) LyricsWe hold hands in the movie show
So they say that were old fashioned
Or we stroll beneath the silv'ry moon, oo-oo-oo-oon
And we carve our initials in the old oak tree
That's old fashioned, that's the way love should be
We enjoy sitting side by side
In the booth in the ice cream parlor
Where we play the nickelodeon, ah-ah-ah-ahn
And we dance when we hear our favorite melody
That's old fashioned, that's the way love should be
Its a modern changing world
Everything is moving fast
But when it comes to love I like
What they did in the past
Im the kind who loves only one
So the boys say Im old fashioned
Let them laugh, honey I don't mi-i-i-i-ind
I've made plans for a wedding day for you and me
That's old fashioned, that's the way love should beYou might also likeEmbed
