The Price of Love LyricsWine is sweet and gin is bitter
Drink all you can, but you won't forget her
You talk too much, you laugh too loud
You see her face in every crowd
That's the price of love
The price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love
The price of love
Can cost you more when you're to blame
Kiss one girl, kiss another
Kiss them all, but you won't recover
You're dancing slow, you're dancing fast
You're happy now, but that won't last
That's the price of love
The price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love
The price of love
Costs you more when you're to blameYou might also likeEmbed
