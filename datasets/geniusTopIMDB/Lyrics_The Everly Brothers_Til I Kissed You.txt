(â€™Til) I Kissed You Lyrics
Never felt like this until I kissed ya
How did I exist until I kissed ya
Never had you on my mind
Now you're there all the time
Never knew what I missed 'til I kissed ya
Uh-huh I kissed ya, oh yeah
Things have really changed since I kissed ya, uh-huh
My life's not the same now that I kissed ya, oh yeah

Mmm, you got a way about ya
Now I can't live without ya
Never knew what I missed 'til I kissed ya
Uh-huh, I kissed ya, oh yeah
You don't realize what you do to me
And I didn't realize what a kiss could be

Mmm, you got a way about ya
Now I can't live without ya
Never knew what I missed 'til I kissed ya
Uh-huh, I kissed ya, oh yeah

You don't realize what you do to me
And I didn't realize what a kiss could be

Mmm, you got a way about ya
Now I can't live without ya
Never knew what I missed 'til I kissed ya
Uh-huh, I kissed ya, oh yeah

I kissed ya, uh-huh
I kissed ya, oh yeah
I kissed ya...You might also likeEmbed
