Torture LyricsTorture, Torture
Baby, you're torturing me
Why do you lead me around and make me chase ya
When I catch ya, you won't let me embrace ya
Please baby, have a heart 'cause can't you see
You're torturing me, torturing me
This torture that I'm going through
Is worth the pain if I have you
So if you love me, let me know
But if you don't, please let me go
Torture, Torture
Baby, you're torturing me
You know that I'm crazy about you
Yet you make me do without you
Do you mean to hurt, or don't you see
You're torturing me, torturing meYou might also likeEmbed
