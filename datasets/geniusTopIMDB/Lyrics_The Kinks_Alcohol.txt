Alcohol Lyrics[Intro]
{Now I wanna tell you a little story
About the old demon alcohol
Yes indeed my little chickadee}

[Verse 1]
Here is a story about a sinner
He used to be a winner
Who enjoyed a life of prominence and position
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition
It turned him to the booze
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision
The floosie made him spend his dough
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission
It's such a shame

[Chorus]
Oh demon alcohol
Sad memories I can't recall
Who thought I would say
Damn it all and blow it all
Oh demon alcohol
Memories I can't recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol

Sad memories I can't recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol

[Verse 2]
Barley wine, pink gin
He'll drink anything
Port, pernod or tequila
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks
As long as all his troubles disappeared
You might also likeBut he messed up his life when he beat up his wife
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
She's gonna turn him on to drink
She's gonna lead him to the brink
And when his money's gone
She'll leave him in the gutter
It's such a shame

[Chorus]
Oh demon alcohol
Sad memories I can't recall
Who thought I would fall
Damn it all, low, low
[Instrumental -  brass]

Sad memories I can't recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol
