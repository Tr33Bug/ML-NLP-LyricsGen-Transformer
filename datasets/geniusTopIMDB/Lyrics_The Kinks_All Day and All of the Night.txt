All Day and All of the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm not content to be with you in the daytime
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time

[Chorus]
The only time I feel all right is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
[Verse 2]
I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah, all day and nighttime yours, leave me never

[Chorus]
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl, I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night
Oh, come on
