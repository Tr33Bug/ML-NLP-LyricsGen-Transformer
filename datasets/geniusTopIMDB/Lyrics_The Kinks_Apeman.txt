Apeman Lyrics[Verse 1]
I think I'm sophisticated
'Cause I'm living my life like a good homosapien
But all around me everybody's multiplying
'Til they're walking round like flies man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages
In the zoo man
'Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an ape man

[Verse 2]
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man
[Chorus]
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm voodoo man
I'm an ape man
'Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an ape man

[Spoken Interlude]
"In man's evolution he has created the city and
The motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance
And I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle"

[Chorus]
'Cause the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury
To be like an ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I look out the window, but I can't see the sky
'Cause the air pollution is a-fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an ape man
You might also like[Bridge]
Come on and love me
Be my ape man girl
And we'll be so happy
In my ape man world

[Chorus]
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
And we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an ape man4Embed
