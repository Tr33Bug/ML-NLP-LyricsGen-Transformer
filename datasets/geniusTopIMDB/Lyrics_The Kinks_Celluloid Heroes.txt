Celluloid Heroes Lyrics[Refrain]
Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in movies
Doesn't matter who you are
There are stars in every city
In every house and on every street
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete

[Verse 1]
Don't step on Greta Garbo
As you walk down the boulevard
She looks so weak and fragile
That's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne
But she turned her back on stardom
Because she wanted to be alone
[Chorus]
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain

[Verse 2]
Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive
And he looks up ladies dresses
As they sadly pass him by
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
Because he's liable to turn and bite
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life

[Verse 3]
If you covered him with garbage
George Sanders would still have style
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn 'round and smile
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
Because she's not very tough
She should have been made of iron or steel
But she was only made of flesh and blood

[Chorus]
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
Oh, people who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain
You might also like[Refrain]
Everybody's a dreamer
And everybody's a star
And everybody's in show biz
It doesn't matter who you are
And those who are successful
Be always on your guard
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die

[Chorus]
You can see all the stars as you walk along Hollywood Boulevard
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

[Outro]
Oh, celluloid heroes never feel any pain
Oh, celluloid heroes never really die
I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die2Embed
