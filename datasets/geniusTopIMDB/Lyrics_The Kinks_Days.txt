Days Lyrics[Verse]
Thank you for the days
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me
I'm thinking of the days
I won't forget a single day, believe me
I bless the light
I bless the light that lights on you, believe me
And though you're gone
You're with me every single day, believe me

[Bridge 1]
Days I'll remember all my life
Days when you can't see wrong from right
You took my life
But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me
But it's alright
Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me
[Bridge 2]
I wish today could be tomorrow
The night is dark
It just brings sorrow, let it wait

[Verse]
Thank you for the days
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me
I'm thinking of the days
I won't forget a single day, believe me

[Bridge 1]
Days I'll remember all my life
Days when you can't see wrong from right
You took my life
But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me
But it's alright
Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me
Days

[Verse]
Thank you for the days
Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me
I'm thinking of the days
I won't forget a single day, believe me
I bless the light
I bless the light that shines on you believe me
And though you're gone
You're with me every single day, believe me
