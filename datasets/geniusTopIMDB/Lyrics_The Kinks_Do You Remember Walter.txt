Do You Remember Walter? Lyrics[Verse 1]
Walter
Remember when the world was young and all the girls knew Walter's name?
Walter
Isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter
Playing cricket in the thunder and the rain?
Do you remember, Walter
Smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate?
Yes, Walter was my mate
But Walter, my old friend, where are you now?
[Verse 2]
Walter's name
Walter
Isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?
Do you remember, Walter, how we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free?
We'd save up all our money and we'd buy a boat and sail away to sea
But it was not to be
I knew you then, but do I know you now?

[Verse 3]
Walter
You are just an echo of a world I knew so long ago
Walter
If you saw me now you wouldn't even know my name
I bet you're fat and married and you're always home in bed by half-past eight
And if I talked about the old times, you'd get bored and you'd have nothing more to say
Yes, people often change
But memories of people can remainYou might also like1Embed
