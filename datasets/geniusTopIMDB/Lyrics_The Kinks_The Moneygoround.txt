The Moneygoround Lyrics[Verse 1]
Robert owes half to Grenville
Who, in turn, gave half to Larry, who
Adored my instrumentals
And so he gave half to a foreign publisher
He took half the money
That was earned in some far distant land
Gave back half to Larry
And I end up with half of goodness knows what

[Bridge]
Can somebody explain
Why things go on this way?
I thought they were my friends
I can't believe it's me
I can't believe that I'm so green
[Chorus]
Eyes down, round and round
Let's all sit and watch the money-go-round
Everyone take a little bit here and a little bit there
Do they all deserve money from a song that they've never heard?
They don't know the tune and they don't know the words
But they don't give a damn
There's no end to it
I'm in a pit and I'm stuck in it
The money goes 'round and around and around
And it comes out here
When they've all taken their share

[Verse 2]
I went to see a solicitor and my story was heard and the writs were served
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
I decided to fight right to the end
But if I ever get my money
I'll be too old and grey to spend it

[Outro]
Oh, but life goes on and on
And no one ever wins
And time goes quickly by
Just like the money-go-round
I only hope that I'll surviveYou might also likeEmbed
