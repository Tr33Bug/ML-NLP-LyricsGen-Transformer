Victoria Lyrics[Verse 1]
Long ago, life was clean
Sex was bad, called obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Croquet lawns, village greens
Victoria was my queen

[Chorus]
Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
[Verse 2]
I was born, lucky me
In a land that I love
Though I'm poor, I am free
When I grow, I shall fight
For this land, I shall die
Let her sun never set

[Chorus]
Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

[Bridge]
Land of hope and the gloria
Land of my Victoria
Land of hope and the gloria
Land of my Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

[Chorus]
Victoria, Victoria
Victoria, 'toria

[Verse 3]
Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the West to the East
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all

Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria
