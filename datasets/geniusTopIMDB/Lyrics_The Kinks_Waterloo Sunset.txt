Waterloo Sunset Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright

[Bridge]
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
[Chorus]
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

[Verse 2]
Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night

[Bridge]
But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

[Verse 3]
Millions of people swarming like flies
Round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
You might also like[Bridge]
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

[Refrain]
