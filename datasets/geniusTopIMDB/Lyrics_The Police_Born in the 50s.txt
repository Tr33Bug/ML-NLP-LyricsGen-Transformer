Born in the â€™50s Lyrics
We were born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s

My mother cried when President Kennedy died
She said it was the communists but I knew better
Would they drop the bomb on us while we made love on the beach?
We were the class they couldn't teach 'cause we knew better
We were born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s

They screamed when the Beatles sang
And they laughed when the King fell down the stairs
Oh, they should've known better
Oh, we hated our aunts, then we messed in our pants
Then we lost our faith and prayed to the TV
Oh, we should've known better

We were born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s

We freeze like statues on the pages of history
Living was never like this when we took all those GCEs
Oh, you opened the door for us and then you turned to dust
You don't understand us, so don't reprimand us
We're taking the future, we don't need no teacher

We were born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s

We were born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s
Born, born in the '50s1Embed
