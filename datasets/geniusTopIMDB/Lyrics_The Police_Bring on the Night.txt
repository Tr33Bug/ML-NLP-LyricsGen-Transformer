Bring on the Night Lyrics

The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow, it's just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye

Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
The future is but a question mark
Hangs above my head there in the dark
Can't see for the brightness is staring me blind
As I bid yesterday goodbye

Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight


Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight

Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
I couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylight
Couldn't stand another hour of daylightYou might also like1Embed
