Darkness Lyrics
I can dream up schemes when I'm sitting in my seat
I don't see any flaws until I get to my feet
I wish I never woke up this morning
Life was easy when it was boring

I could make a mark if it weren't so dark
I could be replaced by any bright spark
But darkness makes me fumble
For a key to a door that's wide open
Instead of worrying about my clothes
I could be someone that nobody knows
I wish I never woke up this morning
Life was easy when it was boring

I can dream up schemes when I'm sitting in my seat
I don't see any flaws until I get to my feet
I wish I never woke up this morning
Life was easy when it was boringYou might also like2Embed
