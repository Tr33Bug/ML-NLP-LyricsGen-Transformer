Deathwish Lyrics
Deathwish in the fading light
Headlight pointing through the night
Never thought I'd see the day
Playing with my life this way

Gotta keep my foot right down
If I had wings I'd leave the ground
Burning in the outside lane
People think that I'm insane
Insane!
The day I take a bend too fast
Judgement that could be my last
I'll be wiped right off the slate
Don't wait up cause I'll be late
I'll be late
