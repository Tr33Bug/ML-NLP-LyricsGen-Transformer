Driven to Tears Lyrics
How can you say that you're not responsible?
What does it have to do with me?
What is my reaction, what should it be?
Confronted by this latest atrocity

Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Hide my face in my hands
Shame wells in my throat
My comfortable existence is reduced
To a shallow, meaningless party
Seems that when some innocents die
All we can offer them is a page in a some magazine
Too many cameras and not enough food
'Cause this is what we've seen

Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah


Protest is futile
Nothing seems to get through
What's to become of our world?
Who knows what to do?
You might also like
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
