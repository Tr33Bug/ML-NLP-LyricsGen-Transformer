Hole in My Life Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life

Shadow in my heart
Is tearing me apart
Or maybe it's just something
In my stars
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life

Be a happy man
I try the best I can
Or maybe I'm just looking
For too much

There's something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please

There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
You might also like
There's something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please

Oh, there's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life
There's a hole in my life

In my life
In my life
In my life
In my life
In my life
In my life1Embed
