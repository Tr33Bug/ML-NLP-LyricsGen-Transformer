Miss Gradenko Lyrics
Don't tell the director I said so
But are you safe, Miss Gradenko?
We were at a policy meeting
They were planning new ways of cheating
I didn't want to rock your boat
But you sent this dangerous note

You've been letting your feelings show
Are you safe, Miss Gradenko?
Miss Gradenko, are you safe?
Are you safe, Miss Gradenko?
Miss Gradenko, are you safe?
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody at all in here?
Nobody but us in here
Nobody but us
Is anybody alive in here?
Nobody but us

Your uniform don't seem to fit
You're much too alive in it

You've been letting your feelings show
Are you safe, Miss Gradenko?
Miss Gradenko, are you safe?

Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody at all in here?
Nobody but us in here
Nobody but us
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody alive in here?
Is anybody at all in here?
Nobody but us in here
Nobody but us
Nobody but us in here
Nobody but usYou might also likeEmbed
