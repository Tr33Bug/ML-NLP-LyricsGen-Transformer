O My God Lyrics
Everyone I know is lonely
And God is so far away
And my heart belongs to no one
So now sometimes I pray

Take the space between us
And fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh my God, You take the biscuit
Treating me this way
Expecting me to treat You well
No matter what You say
How can I turn the other cheek?
It's black and bruised and torn
I've been waiting
Since the day that I was born

Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up

Take the space between us
Fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up, fill it up
Fill it up, fill it up
Fill it up, fill it up

The fat man in his garden
The thin man at his gate
My God, You must be sleeping
Wake up, it's much too late
You might also like
Take the space between us
Fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up, fill it up
Fill it up, fill it up
Fill it up, fill it up

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days
Since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me
That ends up getting wet2Embed
