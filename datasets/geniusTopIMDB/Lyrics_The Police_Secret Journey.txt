Secret Journey Lyrics
Upon a secret journey
I met a holy man
His blindness was his wisdom
I'm such a lonely man

And as the world was turning
It rolled itself in pain
This does not seem to touch you
He pointed to the rain
You will see light in the darkness
You will make some sense of this
When you've made your secret journey
You will find this love you miss

And on the days that followed
I listened to his words
I strained to understand him
I chased his thoughts like birds

You will see light in the darkness
You will make some sense of this
When you've made your secret journey
You will find this love you miss

You will see light in the darkness
You will make some sense of this
You will see a joy in this sadness
You will find this love you miss

And when you've made your secret journey
You will be a holy man
When you've made your secret journey
You will be a holy man
When you've made your secret journey
You will be a holy man
When you've made your secret journey
You will be a holy manYou might also like5Embed
