The Bedâ€™s Too Big Without You Lyrics
Bed's too big without you
Cold wind blows right through that open door
I can't sleep with your memory
Dreaming dreams of what used to be
When she left I was cold inside
That look on my face was just pride
No regrets no love no tears
Living on my own was the least of my fears

Now the bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big
Without you
Since that day when you'd gone
Just had to carry on
I get through the day but late at night
Made love to my pillow
But it didn't feel right
Every day, just the same
Old rules for the same old game
All I gained was heartache
All I made was one mistake

Now the bed's too big without you
The bed's too big without you
The bed's too big
Without youYou might also like2Embed
