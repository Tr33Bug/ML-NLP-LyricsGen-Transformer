Too Much Information Lyrics
Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane
Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane

I've seen the whole world six times over
Sea of Japan to the Cliffs of Dover
I've seen the whole world six times over
Sea of Japan to the Cliffs of Dover
Overkill, overview
Over my dead body
Over me, over you
Over everybody

Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane
Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane

Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane
Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane

Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane
Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane

I've seen the whole world six times over
Sea of Japan to the Cliffs of Dover
I've seen the whole world six times over
Sea of Japan to the Cliffs of Dover

Over my dead body
Over me, over you
Over everybody

Too much information running through my brain
Too much information driving me insane
Too much information running through my brain
