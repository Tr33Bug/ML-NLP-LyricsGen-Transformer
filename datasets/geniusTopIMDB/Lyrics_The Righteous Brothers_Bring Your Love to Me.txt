Bring Your Love to Me Lyrics
When your lips long to be kissed
And your heart cries for love that you have missed

Bring your love to me
Darling, please don't you be a prude
No, don't go to him (Don't go to him)
Bring your love to me (Bring your love to me)

Just to feel your lips next to mine once more
Would be just what my heart's been crying for
So please take my hand
Darling, please walk away with me
Please don't go to him (Don't go to him)
Bring your love to me (Bring your love to me)

When you're in his arms
I can feel my heart crying
When he takes your hand
I can feel my soul dying
How could I be so blind?
To lose a love that was only mine
All the stories that I heard were wrong
Without your love, I can't go on

So bring your love to me
Darling, please don't you be a prude
No, don't go to him (Don't go to him)
Bring your love to me (Bring your love)
Oh, bring your love (Bring your love)
Please bring your love (Bring your love)
I got to have your love (Bring your love)
