Dream On LyricsLay your head down on my shoulder
I won't let the night get colder
I'll protect you
I'll be keepin' trouble far from where your sleepin'
Until you wake in the mornin '
You've got the world to yourself
Dream on
Dream about the world we're gonna live in one fine day
Dream on
Spend the night in heaven, I'll be here to light your way
Someday tomorrow will smile
But little girl in the meanwhile
Dream on
You're a princess. Chains around you
I'm a hero who just found you
'Til a brand new day must wake you
Let imagination take you
Go where the music is playin'
I'll be along in a while
Baby, baby Dream on
Dream about the world we're gonna live in one fine day
Dream on
Spend the night in heaven, I'll be here to light your way
Dream on
