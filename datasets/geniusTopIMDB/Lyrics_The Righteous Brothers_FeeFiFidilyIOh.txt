Fee-Fi-Fidily-I-Oh Lyrics
I've been working on the railroad, people
All the live long day
I keep on saying that I’ve been working on the railroad, people
Just to pass the time away
Yeah, yeah
And now can't you hear the whistle blowing?
You got to  rise up so early in the mornin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can’t you hear the captain shoutin'?
Dinah, blow your horn
Dinah, won't you blow
Dinah. won't you blow
Dinah, won't you blow your horn
Woah!
Dinah, won't you blow
Dinah, won't you blow
Dinah, won't you blow your horn

Yeah
Haha, come on
Go get that thing
Alright
Yeah

Yeah, someone’s in the front room with Dinah
Yeah, someone’s in the front room, front room
So you can't have any fun in the kitchen, babe
You’re right, I can't
I said someone's in the front room with Dinah
Wailin' on a natural banjo
Oh, oh, get it
That’s it
Mind if you comin', baby?
Oh no
Yeah
