Give It to the People LyricsEver since the time that I was ten years old
I dream about the way it would be
Mama had me playing on that classical piano
But that was not the music for me
I had my very first introduction
By singing in a local band
I've got my rock and my roll instruction
Playing every club in the land
I made a deal with the angel of music
And I found what you said was true
If you give it to the people like the people want it
They'll give it, they'll give it
They'll give it right back to you
I can't think of anything that I wouldn't do
As long as someone wants me to sing
You don't have to label me a Hollywood hero
Just let me do my righteous thing!
â€˜Cos when the crowd they're just waiting for you
And the lights they check-out okay
There ain't no words to describe the feeling
That everybody's come to hear you play
(Yes I will)
I made a deal with the angel of music
And I learned what it's all about
If you give it to the people like they wanna hear it
They'll let it, they'll let it
They'll let it all hang all night
You know I, you know I made a deal with the angel of music
And I found what she said it was true
If you give it to the people like the people wanted
They'll give it, they'll give it
They'll give it right back to you
I made a deal with the angel of music
And I learned what it's all about
If you give it to the people like they wanna hear itYou might also likeEmbed
