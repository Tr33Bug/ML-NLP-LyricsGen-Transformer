Go Ahead and Cry Lyrics
Love can change a young boy into a man
But a broken heart can change a man back into a boy again
You're not the first man to cry when things have gone wrong
You're only human, you're only so strong
It takes more than a tear to knock a big man down
It takes more broken hearts to keep him down on the ground
It takes three little words to make him stand again

So cry
Go ahead and cry, cry
Love is so easy to play but so hard to read
You're still a young man, your heart will love again
It takes more, little kiss from her sweet tender lips
It takes more, gentle touch from her soft finger tips
It takes more than one tear to mend a broken heart

So cry
Go ahead and cry, cry
Go ahead and cry
Don't be ashamed to cry, cryYou might also likeEmbed
