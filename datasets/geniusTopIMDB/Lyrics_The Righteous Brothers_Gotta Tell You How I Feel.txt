Gotta Tell You How I Feel Lyrics
Woah, people

Sometimes I get a feeling down in my soul
When I get that feeling and here it goes
Yeah, I gotta say to you
I gotta say it 'cause I feel
Sometimes it’s good (Sometimes it's good)
Sometimes it's bad (Sometimes it’s bad)
Sometimes I'm blue (Sometimes I'm blue)
Sometimes I'm glad (Sometimes I'm glad)
But no matter how I feel, I gotta tell you how I feel
(You got to talk)
Talk to somebody when you're feeling blue
(You got to talk)
Talk to somebody when your dreams fall down on you
I've got to sing to you people when I feel my soul, yeah
And listen to the people, gonna tell you how I feel
I don't feel very good (Not lying to you people)
