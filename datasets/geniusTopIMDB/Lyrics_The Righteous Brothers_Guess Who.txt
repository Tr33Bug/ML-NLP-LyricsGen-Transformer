Guess Who? LyricsSomeone really loves you
Guess who
Guess who
Someone really cares
Guess who (guess who)
Open up your heart
In the end you'll see
That someone really cares
Itâ€™s me
Someone really loves you
Guess who
Guess who
Someone really cares
Guess who (guess who)
Open up your heart
Then you'll see
That someone who really cares
Is me
Is me
