Hey, Girl LyricsHey, Girl! I want you to know
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go
And, Hey, Girl! I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of me's going to die
If you say so long, if this is goodbye. Oh!
Hey, Girl! This can't be true
How am I supposed to exist without you?
And, Hey, Girl! Now don't put me on
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone
How will I live. How can I go on
How can I go on? Hey, Girl!
Hey, Girl! Now sit yourself down
I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!
Don't go away. Hey, Girl!You might also likeEmbed
