I Believe Lyrics
I believe in the power and I never, ever doubt
Ev'ry minute, ev'ry hour I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know
I get my help from the power in the sky
I believe

No need askin' where I've been just ask me where I'm goin'
I won't be ashamed to tell ya, I live my life knowin'
All the roads ahead of me are filled with peace and love
Ev'ry step so heavenly ya fall and bounce right up
All miracles and dreams realize for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible now if you believe
I believe in the power and I never, ever doubt
Ev'ry minute, ev'ry hour I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know
I get my help from the power in the sky
I believe

Lookin' in the mirror, I can see my eyes are glowin'
Living testimony that the spirit's in me flowin'
Oh, I'm feelin' so good, got to raise my hands and rejoice
Say a few words to praise him ev'rytime I lift my voice
All miracles and dreams realize for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible now if you believe

I believe in the power and I never, ever doubt
Ev'ry minute, ev'ry hour I believe
I believe in myself 'cause I know
I get my help from the power in the skyYou might also likeEmbed
