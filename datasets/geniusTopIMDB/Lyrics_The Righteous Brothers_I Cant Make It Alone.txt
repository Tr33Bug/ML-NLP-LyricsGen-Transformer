I Can’t Make It Alone LyricsNow you know me
And you know how proud I am
And what I'm gonna tell you now
Won't be easy to say
Before I left you
I was a happy man
But I've been so lonely
Since you've been away
And girl, I've tried and I know I can't make it alone
It's such a hard way to go, I just can't make it alone
There's something in my soul
That will always lead me back to you
What can I say now?
Being sorry is just not good enough
I wouldn't blame you if you hurt me now
The way I hurt you then
But who else can I turn to?
Baby, I'm begging you
Please reach out to a dying man
And let him live again
'Cause girl, I've tried and I know I can't make it alone
It's such a hard way to go I just can't make it alone
There's something in my soul
That will always lead me back to you
Help me, girl, I need you
Please help meYou might also likeEmbed
