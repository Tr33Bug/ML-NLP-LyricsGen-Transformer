I Still Love You Lyrics
When somebody puts you down
And your hearts gets kicked around
Every time you love and lose
You run to me with your bad news

I don't wanna see you cry anymore
I don't wanna see the tears in your eyes anymore
It hurts me to see your heart so broken up
'Cause I, I still love you (I still love you)
I still need you (I still need you)
And I still want you (I still want you)
'Cause you're my baby (I still love you)
When your new love's tired of you
And you don't know what to do
That's when you come back to me
But my baby, can't you see?

I don't wanna see you cry anymore
I don't wanna see the tears in your eyes anymore
It hurts me to see your heart so broken up
'Cause I, I still love you (I still love you)
I still need you (I still need you)
And I still want you (I still want you)
'Cause you're my baby (I still love you)
'Cause I still love you (I still love you)
Honey, I need you (I still need you)
And I still want you (I still want you)
'Cause you're my baby (I still love you)

Woah, I still want you, pretty baby (I still love you)
Honey, I need you (I still need you)
And I still love youYou might also likeEmbed
