Iâ€™m Leaving It Up to You LyricsI'm leavin' it all up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove?
Or are we through?
That's why I'm leaving it up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove?
Or are we through?
I've got my heart in my hand
I-I don't understand
Baby, what, what have I done wrong?
You know, I worship the ground that you walk on
That's why I'm leavin' it up to you-ooh-ooh
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my lo-o-ove?
Or are we through?You might also likeEmbed
