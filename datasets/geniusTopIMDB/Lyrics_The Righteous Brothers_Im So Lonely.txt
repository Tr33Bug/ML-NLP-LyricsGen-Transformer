Iâ€™m So Lonely Lyrics
I need
I need your heart to want me
I need your lips to kiss me
I need your love
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely

I want, I want each tear you cry
I want each tear to weep on me
I want your love
I'm so lonely, oh-oh, so lonely
A heart would break inside, if you turn your back on me
Now that you know, my love is gone
So look at my life, and then make up your mind
And I'll never, never, let you go-o-o

I pray
Oh-oh-oh-oh
That you will be my love
So hear my prayer
I need your love

I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
Let me tell you now, I'm so lonely
So lonely, I'm so lonely, baby
What can I do? Tell me now, what can I do?
Oh-oh-oh-ohYou might also likeEmbed
