Is It So Wrong LyricsDo you see, do you care?
Do you even notice I'm there?
The road goes on to the end
And you're the friend of a friend
So we meet and we smile
And inside I'm only a child
But lies have lost their appeal
My eyes betrayed what I feel
I've been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone who'll never be mine?
I've been hoping so long you would want me one day
Perhaps this time around you'd just might
But is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so right?
Do you see and do you know?
If you do, you don't let it show
The world is on all around
And I can always be found
So I walk and I ran
And I prayed it isn't too late
For who knows better than I
If time is passing me by?
I've been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone who'll never be mine?
I've been hoping so long you would want me one day
But I never once believed you really would
And is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so good?
Tell me, is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so good?You might also likeEmbed
