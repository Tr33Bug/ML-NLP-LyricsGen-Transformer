Justine Lyrics
Justine

Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
Yeah, you just don't treat me right
And Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
You just don't treat me right
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night
Goin' to the barber shop
Gonna have them do me up
Gonna get clean for my little buttercup

Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
Yeah, you just don't treat me right
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late in the night

Hey (Hey)
Ho (Ho)
Hey (Hey)
Ho (Ho)
Oh-oh

Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
Justine, Justine
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night
Ah

Goin' to the barber shop
Gonna have them do me up
Gonna get clean for my little buttercup

Justine, Justine
Yeah, girl, you just don't treat me right
You like to ball in the mornin'
And stay out late at night
Oh, woah
