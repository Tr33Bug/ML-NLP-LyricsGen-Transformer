Ko Ko Mo Lyrics
Talk to me, baby
Whisper in my ear
Talk to me, baby
Whisper in my ear
Come a little closer
Don't have no fear

Heard what you told me
Heard what you said
Heard what you told me
Heard what you said
Don't worry my pretty
Won't lose my head
Don't you know
That I love you so?
Well, don't you know
That I love you so?
When I holler hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ko ko mo

Dimples on her elbows
Dimples on her knees
Dimples on her elbows
Dimples on her knees
She thrills and thrills me
With just a little squeeze

Don't you know
That I love you so?
Well, don't you know
That I love you so?
When I holler hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Ko ko mo

Ko ko, a ko ko mo
Ko ko, a ko ko mo
Ko ko, a ko ko mo
Ko ko, a ko ko mo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
A ko ko moYou might also likeEmbed
