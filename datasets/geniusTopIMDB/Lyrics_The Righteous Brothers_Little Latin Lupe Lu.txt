Little Latin Lupe Lu Lyrics
Uno, dos
One, two, three, quatro

Talk about my baby
A little Latin Lupe Lu
She's a hot footin' baby
There ain't no dance she couldn't do
She's my groovy little baby
A little Latin Lupe Lu
A bopa bopa Lupe Lu
A shake it, shake it, shake it, Lupe
Wahtusi, pretty baby
C'mon and do the who-chee-coo
Magic love, pretty baby
A little Latin Lupe Lu

And if you wanna do the twist
The Lupe Lu can put it down
If you wah, wahtusi
She's the best for miles around
She's my mash potato baby
A little Latin Lupe Lu

A bopa bopa Lupe Lu
A shake it, shake it, shake it, Lupe
Wahtusi, pretty baby
C'mon and do the who-chee-coo
Magic love, pretty baby
A little Latin Lupe Lu

You might also like
One, one more time
A shake it, shake it, shake it Lupe
Wahtusi, pretty baby
C'mon and do the who-chee-coo
Magic love, pretty baby
A little Latin Lupe Lu

A little Latin Lupe Lu
A little Latin Lupe Lu
A little Latin Lupe LuEmbed
