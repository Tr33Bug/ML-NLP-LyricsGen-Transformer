Never Say I Love You LyricsHey baby, are you sleeping?
There's something I think we oughta talk about
I can't put my finger on it, but honey
I know there's something wrong
It's the same hello you gave me
When I came home tonight
Your kiss was warm and tender
And the same arms held me tight
Now you laying right here beside me
Something that you always do
Oh, it isn't what you say that's been givin' you away
I just know that I'm losing you
You can tell me that you need me
That you're feeling it deep inside
You can go through all the motions
Of a woman who's satisfied
Spend your life pretending
It's as good as it was before
But you never say I love you anymore
We're a pretty good combination
In everybody else's eyes
They see us both together
Only we know the truth, only we know the lie
You can tell me that you need me
That you're feeling it deep inside
You can go through all the motions
Of a woman who's satisfied
Spend, spend your life pretending
It's as good as it was before
But you never say I love you
I love you anymore
You can tell me that you need me
That you're feeling it deep inside
You can go through all the motions
Of a woman who's satisfied
