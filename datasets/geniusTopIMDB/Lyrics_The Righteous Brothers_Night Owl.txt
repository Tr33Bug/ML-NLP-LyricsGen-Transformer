Night Owl Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woah-ooh-ooh

Well, here comes the night owl (Ooh, night owl)
Walkin' through the front door (Ooh, night owl)
And like I told you, baby (Ooh)
I don't love you no more
Well, now you try to tell me (Ooh, night owl)
What a fool you've been (Ooh, night owl)
Well, it's all over (Ooh)
Since I don't, I don't know well (Ooh)
I, I know what you're puttin' down (Ooh)
Now I, I 'cause the news is all over town
So, hold on (Ooh, night owl)
You done me wrong, bye, bye, baby (Ooh, night owl)
You done me wrong, bye, bye, baby
Yeah, bye, bye (Ooh)
Bye, so long (Ooh)
Well, I, I know what you're puttin' down (Ooh)
I, and I 'cause the news is all, all over town
So long (Ooh, night owl)
Bye, bye, girl, bye, so long (Ooh, night owl)
Bye, bye, baby (Ooh)
Bye, bye (Ooh, night owl)
Bye, bye
Bye, bye (Ooh, night owl)
So long, girl, so long (Ooh, night owl)
So long, bye  (Ooh, night owl)You might also likeEmbed
