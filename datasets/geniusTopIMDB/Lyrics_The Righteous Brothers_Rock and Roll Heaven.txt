Rock and Roll Heaven LyricsIf you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band
Jimi gave us rainbows
And Janis took a piece of our hearts
And Otis brought us all to the dock of a bay
Sing a song to light my fire, remember Jim that way
They've all found another place, another place to play
If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band
Remember bad bad Leroy Brown, hey
Jimmy touched us with that song
Time won't change a friend we came to know
And Bobby gave us Mack the Knife
Well look out, he's back in town
They'll all be there together
When they meet in one big show
If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, band
There's a spotlight waiting
No matter who you are
Cause everybody's got a song to sing
Everyone's a star
(Everybody's got to be a star)
If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand
If there's a rock n' roll heaven
Well you know they've got a hell of a band, band, bandYou might also likeEmbed
