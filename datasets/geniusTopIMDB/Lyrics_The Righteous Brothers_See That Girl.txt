See That Girl LyricsSee that girl?
Look at her good
That's something you don't
See every day, now
Dig those eyes...
Ain't they a prize?
They sure can get to you
And, hey now
Look at that crazy smile
I bet you can't believe
She was mine for a while
Ain't she somethin?
See that guy?
Right by her side
He's feelin' proud, and
Don't he show it
Look and see
That could have been me
Would you believe I'd go
And blow it?
I let her slip away
And I tell myself I'm okay
But it just tears the
Heart out of me
When I see that girl....
When I see that girl
(break)
I let her slip away
And I tell myself I'm okay
But it just tears the
Heart out of me
When I see that girl....
When I see that girl....
When I see that girlYou might also likeEmbed
