Somethingâ€™s Got a Hold on Me Lyrics
Ooh
Woah, sometimes I get a good feeling
Ooh
Yeah, I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no
Ooh
And I believe, I, I, I believe
Ooh
And I got to tell you right now
Okay now, easy, let down
Something's got a hold on me, oh no
(Woah, it must be love)
Woah, something's got a hold on me, must be love, yeah
(Woah, it must be love)
Ooh, ooh

I got a funny feeling, I feel so strange
And everything about me has seemed to change
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk

Said woah (Yeah)
Woah (Yeah)
Woah, woah (Woah)
Woah (Woah)
I said yeah, yeah, yeah
It must be love
(Woah, it must be love)
Ooh, ooh

Something's got a hold on me, yeah, it's a rude feeling
(Woah, it must be love)
Yeah, sing a song, something's got a hold on me, won't let go
Let me hear you now
(Woah, it must be love)
Oh, alright

I got a feeling, I feel so strange
And everything about me has seemed to change
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I believe I'd die if I only could
I feel so strange, but sure is good

Yeah, yeah, want my love (You want my love)
It makes me feel alright (Makes me feel alright)
