Stand By LyricsThere she goes
Walking with him
Wearing the smile she wore
When she used to be mine
But I know that she'll
Come to my side
The minute he
Tells her goodbye
But my heart won't let me forget
That I'm just a standby
For when he's gone
Even though I know it's wrong
I can pretend
That her love is mine
I can pretend she is there
All the time
But it breaks my heart
To know that I'm
Not her man
I'm just a standby
I know I'm a fool
But I don't care
My heart grows so cold when she's gone
But so warm when she's there
I'd rather be a fool
And share her love
Than to be a man
Who's not involved at all
So I will pretend
That her love is mine
I can pretend she is there
All the time
But it breaks my heart
To know that I'm
Not her man
I'm just a standbyYou might also likeEmbed
