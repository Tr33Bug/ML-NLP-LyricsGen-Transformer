Substitute LyricsSay
You've been waiting much too long now
Don't know when she's coming home
Say now
You've been loyal true and faithful
All this time of being alone
If I could get that same dedication
I'd give you everything in creation
If she doesn't come back (come back) (come back)
Ooh! I'll be your substitute whenever you want me
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
(Send my love and admiration straight to you)
Say (Say)
Everyday you waited for her, I've been waiting here for you
Say (Say)
All this time I've been lonely knowing what you're going through
I waited 'til my chances occured, 'cause you can't keep relying on her
If she doesn't come back (if she doesn't come back)
I'll be your substitute whenever you want me (ooh ooh)
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
Each day by your window (you sit and sigh) hoping to see her face
Well you might as well forget about her and find someone to take her
Place
I'll be your substitute whenever you want me (ooh ooh)
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
I'll be your substitute
Whenever you want me (ooh ooh)
Oh don't you know I'd be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
I'll be your substitute whenever you leave her
Oh don't you know I'd be your substituteYou might also likeEmbed
