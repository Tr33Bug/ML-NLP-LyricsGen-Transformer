The Great Pretender LyricsOh yes, I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such, I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm lonely but no one can tell
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart as a crown
Pretending that you're still around
