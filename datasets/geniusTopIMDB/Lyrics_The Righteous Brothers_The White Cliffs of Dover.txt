The White Cliffs of Dover LyricsThere'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
I'll never forget the people I met
Braving those angry sky's
I remember well as the shadows fell
The light of hope in thier eyes
And though I'm far away I still can hear them say
Sun's up
For when the dawn comes up
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
There'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow, when the world is free
The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and seeYou might also likeEmbed
