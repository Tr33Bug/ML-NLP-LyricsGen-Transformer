Try to Find Another Man Lyrics
I think you better
I think you better try to find another man
Try, try to find one who loves you
And live with you the best you can
Don't start none of that grieving
This time I'm leaving
I'm packin' up my suitcase
Try to find another man

When I first met you
You were such a sweet thing
You meant everything to me
So I took you for my bride
Yeah, in five years, you've changed
And now you never do nothin'
All you ever do is sit around the TV set, feed your fat face
Complain and make my life a complete misery
I think you better
I think you better try to find another man
Try, try to find one who loves you
And live with you the best you can
Don't start none of that grieving
This time I'm leaving
I'm packin' up my suitcase
Try to find another man

From the early hours of the morning
'Til the late hours at night
You keep on naggin' me, baby
And tell them folks, I do nothin' right
Oh, I can't stand it no more
And I'm fed up with the way you been treating me all life
But there's one thing I want you to know before I go
There's lots of  in the sea, and I'm gonna give you one
Yes, siree

Oh, I think, I think you better find
You better find
Go out in the street and find a new man
You need a new man, now baby
Get out of my life and stop hangin' to me
Oh-oh, baby
Get out of my life, baby
Yeah, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
