Whatâ€™d I Say Lyrics
Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
Hey, hey, well all right
Hey hey, yeah, tell me what'd I say? Yeah

When you see me in misery
Come on, baby, sit by me
Alright, what'd I say?
What'd I say? What'd I say? Yeah
She's the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
All right, hey, hey, hey
Uh-huh, oh, what'd I say 'bout this? Sing your song

Tell your mother, tell your pa
Gonna send you back to Arkansas
Alright, what'd I say now?
Alright, alright

Tell me what'd I say?
Tell me what'd I say?
Tell me what'd I say?
Tell me what'd I say?
