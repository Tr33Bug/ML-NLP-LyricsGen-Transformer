You Are My Sunshine LyricsThe other night, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you, held you in my arms
But when I woke up, yeah, found out I was mistaken
Ooh I hung my head, hung my head and cried
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
Little girl you make me happy when the skies are grey
But you'll never know dear, just how much I love you
So please don't take, don't take my sunshine away
You told me once, dear, that you really loved me
And that no one could take my pain
But now you've left me and love another
And you've shattered, shattered all my dreams
Yeah you are my sunshine, my only sunshine (oh my sunshine)
You make me happy, yeah (you make me happy) when my skies are grey
But you'll never know dear, how much that I love you
So please don't take (I would never) not if you need me (no, you know I need you now)
Not if you want me, (no, you know I want you now)
Not if you need me girl (no, you know I need you now)
Please don't take, (no, no, no) don't take my sunshine
Don't take my sunshine, (no, no, no, no) don't take my sunshine
Don't take my sunshine awayYou might also likeEmbed
