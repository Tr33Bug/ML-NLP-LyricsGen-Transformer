You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’ Lyrics
You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before
In your fingertips

You're trying hard not to show it (Baby)
But baby, baby, I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Now there's no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize
Little things I do

It makes me just feel like crying (Baby)
'Cause, baby, something beautiful's dying

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away
Baby (Baby), baby (Baby)
I beg of you, please (Please), please (Please)
I need your love (I need your love)
I need your love (I need your love)
So bring it on back (So bring it on back)
Bring it on back (So bring it on back)

Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, whoa-oh-oh

Bring back that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
Bring back that lovin' feelin'
'Cause it's gone, gone...3Embed
