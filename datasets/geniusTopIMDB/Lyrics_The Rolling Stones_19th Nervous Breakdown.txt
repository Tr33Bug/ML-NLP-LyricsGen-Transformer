19th Nervous Breakdown Lyrics
You're the kind of person
You meet at certain dismal dull affairs
Centre of a crowd, talking much too loud
Running up and down the stairs
Well, it seems to me that you have seen
Too much in too few years
And though you've tried you just can't hide
Your eyes are edged with tears

You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
When you were a child, you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax

You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

Oh, who's to blame? That girl's just insane
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse, oh, please

You were still in school when you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that, you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip, I tried so hard
To rearrange your mind
But after while, I realized
You were disarranging mine
You might also like
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown

Oh, who's to blame? That girl's just insane
Well, nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse, oh, please

When you were a child, you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax

You better stop
Look around
Here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown3Embed
