Bitch Lyrics
I'm feeling so tired, can't understand it
Just had a fortnight's sleep
I'm feeling so stuffed, I'm so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk, juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
I'm feeling hungry, can't see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie

Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum, alright
Yeah, you got to mix it, child, you got to fix
It must be love, it's a bitch
Yeah, you got to mix it, child, you got to fix
It must be love, it's a bitch, alright

Sometimes, I'm sexy, move like a stud
Like kicking the stall all night
Sometimes, I'm so shy, got to be worked on
Don't have no bark or bite, alright

Yeah, when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah, when you lay me out
My heart is bumping louder than a big bass drum, alright

I want it, woo
I said, hey, yeah, get alright now, get it
Got to be
Hey, I'll get alright now, get it
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, yeah, get on
Hey, hey, heyYou might also like4Embed
