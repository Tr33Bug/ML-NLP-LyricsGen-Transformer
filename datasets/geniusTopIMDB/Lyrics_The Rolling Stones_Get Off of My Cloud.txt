Get Off of My Cloud Lyrics
I live on an apartment
On the ninety-ninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Who's all dressed up just like the Union Jack
Says, I've won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack

I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"
The telephone is ringing
I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?"
“Well, I guess I'm doing fine“
“It's three AM, there's too much noise
Don't you people ever want to go to bed?
Just because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head?”

I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud, baby"
Yeah

I was sick and tired, fed up with this
So I decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like flags
Stuck on my windscreen
You might also like
I said, "Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd
On my cloud,"

Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around, baby, two's a crowd
On my cloud1Embed
