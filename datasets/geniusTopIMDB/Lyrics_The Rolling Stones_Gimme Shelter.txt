Gimme Shelter Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, yeah

Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red-coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children,yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

Hey, hey

Rape, murder
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder (Woo)
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Yeah
You might also like
Mmm, the flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away, kiss away)
