Honky Tonk Women Lyrics
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind
It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But I just don't seem to sail you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk bluesYou might also like7Embed
