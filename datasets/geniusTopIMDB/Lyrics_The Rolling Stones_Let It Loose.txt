Let It Loose Lyrics
Who's that woman on your arm?
All dressed up to do you harm
And I'm hip to what she'll do
Give her just about a month or two

Bit off more than I can chew
And I knew, yeah I knew what it was leading to
Some things, well, I can't refuse
One of them, one of them the bedroom blues
She delivers right on time
I can't resist a corny line
But take the shine right off your shoes, yeah right off your shoes
Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues

Oh yeah, in the bar, you're getting drunk
Oh yeah oh yeah, I ain’t in love, I ain’t in lust, oh no no no
Hide the switch and shut the light, won't you shut it?
Yeah, let it all come down tonight

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
Your face I'll never see no more
Let it all come down tonight
Keep those tears hid out of sight
Let it loose, yeah let it loose, let it loose
Let it loose, let it all come down
Let it loose, let it loose, yeah, yeah
Let it loose, let it all come down
Let it loose, let it all come down
Let it loose, let it all come down...You might also like1Embed
