Live with Me Lyrics
I got nasty habits
I take tea at three
Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner
It must be hung up for a week
My best friend, he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese
Don't you think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?
Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three (Yeah)
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?
Woo!

And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads, they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century
Well, they queue up for the bathroom
'Round about 7:35
Don't you think we need a woman's touch
To make it come alive?

You'd look good
Pram-pushing down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?
Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes, the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door
You might also likeWoo!
The maid, she's French, she's got no sense
She's from the Crazy Horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footman's eyes get crossed
Woo!

Don't you think there's a place for us
Right across the street?
Don'cha think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?3Embed
