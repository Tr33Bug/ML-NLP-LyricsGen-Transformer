Living in a Ghost Town Lyrics
Woh-oh-oh-oh, Woh-oh-oh-oh

I'm a ghost
Livin' in a ghost town
I'm a ghost
Livin' in a ghost town
You can look for me
But I can't be found
You can search for me
I had to go underground
Life was so beautiful
Then we all got locked down
Feel like a ghost
Living in a ghost town, yeah
Once this place was hummin'
And the air was full of drummin'
The sound of cymbals crashin'
Glasses were all smashin'
Trumpets were all screamin'
Saxophones were blarin'
Nobody was carin' if it's day or night

Woh-oh-oh-oh, Woh-oh-oh-oh

I'm a ghost
Livin' in a ghost town
I'm goin' nowhere
Shut up all alone
So much time to lose
Just starin' at my phone
Every night I am dreamin' that you'll come and creep in my bed
Please let this be over, not stuck in a world without end, my friend

Woh-oh-oh-oh, Woh-oh-oh-oh
Woh-oh-oh-oh, Woh-oh-oh-oh
You might also like
Preachers were all preachin'
Charities beseechin'
Politicians dealin'
Thieves were happy stealin'
Widows were all weepin'
(There's) no beds for us to sleep in
Always had the feelin'
It will all come tumblin' down

I'm a ghost
Livin' in a ghost town
You can look for me
But I can't be found

Woh-oh-oh-oh, Woh-oh-oh-oh
We're all livin' in a ghost town (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, livin' in a ghost town (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
We were so beautiful (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
I was your man about town (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
Livin' in this ghost town (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
Ain't havin' any fun (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
If I wanna party (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
It's a party of one (Woh-oh-oh-oh)
Woh-oh-oh-oh3Embed
