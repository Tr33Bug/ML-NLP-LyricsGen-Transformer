Moonlight Mile Lyrics
When the wind blows, and the rain feels cold
With a head full of snow, with a head full of snow
In the window, there's a face you know
Don't the night pass slow? Don't the nights pass slow?

The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
Just another mad, mad day on the road
I am just living to be lying by your side
But I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
Going to warm my bones, going to warm my bones
I've got silence on my radio
Let the airwaves flow, let the airwaves flow

For I am sleeping under strange, strange skies
Just another mad, mad day on the road
My dreams is fading down the railway line
I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm hiding, sister, and I'm dreaming
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm hiding, baby, but I'm dreaming
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
I'm riding down your moonlight mile
Let it go now
Come on up, baby
Yeah, let it go now
Yeah
Flow now, baby
Yeah, come on now, yeah

Yeah, I'm coming home
'Cause I'm just about a moonlight mile on down the road
On down the road, on down the road
Yeah, yeah, baby6Embed
