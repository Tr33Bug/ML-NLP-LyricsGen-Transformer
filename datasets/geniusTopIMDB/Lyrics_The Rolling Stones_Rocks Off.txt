Rocks Off Lyrics
Oh yeah

I hear you talking when I'm on the street
Your mouth don't move, but I can hear you speak
What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?
And I'm always hearing voices on the street
I want to shout, but I can hardly speak
I was making love last night to a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
Because she come every time that she pirouettes over me
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fucking feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the nasty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene, oh
It's all mesmerized, all that inside me, oh
You might also like
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows, moonlight mystery

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping
(Only get them off, only get them off, only get them off)
(Only get them off, get them off, only get them off)5Embed
