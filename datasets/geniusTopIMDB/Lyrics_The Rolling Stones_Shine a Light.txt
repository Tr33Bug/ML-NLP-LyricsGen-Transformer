Shine a Light Lyrics
Saw you stretched out in room ten-oh-nine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Oh, couldn't see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love

Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love

May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
When you're drunk in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
Whoa, just seemed too many flies on you
I just can't brush them off

Angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
Whoa, thought I heard one sigh for you
Come on up, come on up now, come on up now

May the good Lord shine a light on you, yeah
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you, yeah
Warm like the evening sun
Now, now, now, yeah

Come on up now, come on up now
Come on up now, come on up

May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
Now, now, now, now, now, yeah
Yeah, yeahYou might also like7Embed
