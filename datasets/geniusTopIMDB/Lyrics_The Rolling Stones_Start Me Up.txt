Start Me Up Lyrics
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop

I've been running hot
You got me ticking, now don't blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
Never stop, never stop, never stop
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start it up
Kick on the starter, give it all you got
You got to, you got to
I can't compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it, I can slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up, slide it up

Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine
Start it up

Start me up
Ah, ah, give it all you've got
You've got to never, never, never stop
Slide it up, whoo!
Ah rev it up to start it up
Start it up, start it up, start it up
Never, never, never
You might also like
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen
Hey, hey

If you start it up
Love the day and we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Start me up
Never stop, never stop

You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man cum
You, you make a dead man cum6Embed
