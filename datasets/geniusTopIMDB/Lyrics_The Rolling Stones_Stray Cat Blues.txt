Stray Cat Blues Lyrics
Ah... hey
Yeah, got some tail

I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scare-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs, but
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime
I can see that you're fifteen years old
No, I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home but
That's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you can spit like that

You look so weird, and you're so far from home
Bet you don't really miss your mother
You look so scared I'm not no mad-brained bear
But, but it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh, yeah
Woo!
I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that
You might also like
You say you got a friend, that she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild, then she can join in too
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet your mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my backEmbed
