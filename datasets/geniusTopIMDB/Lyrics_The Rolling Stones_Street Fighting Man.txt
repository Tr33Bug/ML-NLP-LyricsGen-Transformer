Street Fighting Man Lyrics
Everywhere I hear the sound
Of marching, charging feet, boy
'Cause summer's here and the time is right
For fighting in the street, boy

Well, what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Hey, think the time is right
For a palace revolution
'Cause where I live the game to play
Is compromise solution

Well, then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band?
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get down

Hey, said my name is called Disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king
I'll rail at all his servants

Well, then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band?
Because in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
Get downYou might also like5Embed
