Sweet Virginia Lyrics
Wading through the waste, stormy winter
And there's not a friend to help you through
Trying to stop the waves behind your eyeballs
Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues
Thank you for your wine, California
Thank you for your sweet and bitter fruits
Yes I've got the desert in my toenail
And I hid the speed inside my shoe
But come on, come on down, Sweet Virginia
Come on, honey child, I beg of you
Come on, come on down, you've got it in ya
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoes

I want you to come on and sing it with me one time...
All right

Yes, I want you to come on, come on down, Sweet Virginia
I said I want you to come on, honey child, I beg of you
I, I want you come on, honey child you've got it in you, uh huh
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoes
One more time
Hey

But come on, come on down Sweet Virginia
Come on, come on down, I beg of you
Come on, come on down, you've got it in ya, uh huh
Got to scrape that shit right off your shoesYou might also like3Embed
