Sympathy for the Devil Lyrics
Yow....yow....yow
Huh, huh, huh

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
Well, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
You might also like
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah
Oh yeah, get down heavy!


Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game, mm yeah

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, mmm mean it
Get down
Woo hoo!
Ah yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Ba bum bum, ba ba bum....
Ah yeah
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
Tell me, honey, can you guess my name?
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
I'll tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo hoo, ooo hoo, oooo hoo
All right
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yes, what's my name?
Tell me, baby, ah what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name?
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
What's my name...77Embed
