Under My Thumb Lyrics
Under my thumb
The girl who once had me down
Under my thumb
The girl who once pushed me around

It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Ain't it the truth, babe?

Under my thumb
Is a squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb
A girl who has just changed her ways

It's down to me, yes it is
The way she does just what she's told
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Ah, ah, say it's alright

Under my thumb
Is a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb
She's the sweetest pet in the world

It's down to me
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Ah, take it easy babe
Yeah

It's down to me, oh yeah
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb
Yeah, it feels alright

Under my thumb
Her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb
Well I, I can still look at someone else

It's down to me, oh that's what I said
The way she talks when she's spoken to
Down to me, the change has come
She's under my thumb

Say, it's alright
Say it's all...
Say it's all...
Take it easy babe
Take it easy babe
It feels alright
Take it, take it easy, babe6Embed
