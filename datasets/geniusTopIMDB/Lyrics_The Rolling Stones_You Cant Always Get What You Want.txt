You Canâ€™t Always Get What You Want Lyrics
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a foot-loose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime
You'll find
You get what you need
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you might find
You get what you need
Ahh, yeah-h-h
Oh

And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse"
Sing it to me, honey

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need
Ah baby, yeah
Ahh

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And, man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him:

You can't always get what you want, well no
You can't always get what you want, I tell you, baby
You can't always get what you want, no
But if you try sometime
You just might find, uh, mm
You get what you need, oh yeah, woo!
Woo!
You get what you need, yeah, ow baby
Ah yeah

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well, I could tell by her blood-stained hands
Sing it
You can't always get what you want, yeah
You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah, child
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime, you just might find
You just might find, you get what you need, ah yeah
Ah yeah, wooh!
Ah, you can't always get what you want (No no, baby)
You can't always get what you want (You can't now now)
You can't always get what you want
...mmm but if you try sometime, you just might find
You just might find that you get what you need
Ah yeah!
Ah yeah! Do that23Embed
