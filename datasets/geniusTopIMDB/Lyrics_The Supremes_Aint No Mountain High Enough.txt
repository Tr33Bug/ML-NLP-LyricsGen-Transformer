Ainâ€™t No Mountain High Enough Lyrics
Listen baby, ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
If you need me call me
No matter where you are, no matter how far
(Don't worry baby)
Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
'Cause baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Remember the day, I set you free
I told you could always count on me, darling (Yeah, baby)
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, somehow
'Cause baby there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Oh no, darling
No wind, no rain or winter's cold
Can stop me, baby, oh no
'Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble I'll be there on the double
Just send for me, oh baby
My love is alive deep down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double just as fast as I can
Don't you know that there
You might also like
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe
Don't you know that there ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no valley low enoughEmbed
