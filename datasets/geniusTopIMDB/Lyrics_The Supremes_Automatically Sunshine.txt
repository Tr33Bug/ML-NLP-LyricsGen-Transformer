Automatically Sunshine LyricsOh, Baby, let's take life's highway
It's automatically yours and my way
No road is too rough to travel
We'll walk barefoot on life's gravel
Together whatever we express now
Automatically means success now
Whatever mystery life's about
There's no doubt we'll work it out
CHORUS
Cause you're mine and I'm yours
So who cares if when it rains it pours?
I'm yours and you're mine
It's automatically sunshine
Oh baby until you find you
Automatically I'm behind you
So do your thing and always know
Where you go I'm going to follow
Don't you worry when you're setback
Home you'll hurry and then you'll get back
All the courage my love can give
All our lives long as we live
