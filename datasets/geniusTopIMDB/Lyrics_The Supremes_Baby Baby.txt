Baby Baby Lyrics
Keep me, baby
Yeah
Love me, baby

Don't you know I'll never let you down
No matter what you do
Don't you know I'll always be around
Just to take care of you
And baby, baby
May our love always remain
And baby, baby
Let no one ever take my place in your heart again

I'll be there to take away the pain
Whenever you hurt inside
Surround you with the walls of happiness
And let no one hurt your pride

And baby, baby
When sorrow pounds your door
And baby, baby
You can depend on me to love you back much more

Keep me, baby
Yeah
Love me, baby

And baby, baby
You're all I'll ever be
And baby, baby
Love me forever and share in this sweet ecstasy
You might also like
Yeah
Baby, baby
Keep me, baby
Love me, baby
Kiss me, baby
Squeeze me, baby
Hold me, baby
Love me, baby
Hold me, babyEmbed
