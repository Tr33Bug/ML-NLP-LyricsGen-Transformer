But I Love You More LyricsBut I love you more than I've ever loved anyone, baby
He says the same things you used to say
Does the same things you used to do
(Sometimes I miss you baby)
Sometimes I find myself wishing he was you
Cause I still miss you (Oh yeah)
And I love you more than I'll ever love anyone
Yes I love you more than I'll ever love anyone
Thoughts of you still burn in my mind
But my new love takes all my time
(Sometimes I miss you, baby)
With him I can get away
Cheatin' yesterday
Cause he makes me forget you â€“ sometimes (Oh yeah)
But I love you more than I'll ever loved anyone
Yes I'll love you more than I'll ever love anyone
If you'd never left me lonely
You still love me
But he satisfied my eyes that hungered for you
Though I tried not to love him
The feeling just grew
But I love you more than I'll ever love anyone
Yes I love you more than I'll ever love anyone
Yes I love you more than I'll ever love anyone
I love you more... anyone
Yes I love you more than I'll ever love anyoneYou might also likeEmbed
