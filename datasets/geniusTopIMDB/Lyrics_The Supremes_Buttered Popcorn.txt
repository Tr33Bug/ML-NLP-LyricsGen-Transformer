Buttered Popcorn Lyrics
My baby likes (Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
He likes it greasy (Buttered popcorn)
And sticky (Buttered popcorn)
And gooey (Buttered popcorn)
And salty (Buttered popcorn)
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like (Buttered popcorn)
He took me to a show (Buttered popcorn)
He said he wanted some more (Buttered popcorn)
I said kiss me please (Buttered popcorn)
He said after I eat (Buttered popcorn)

I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like (Buttered popcorn)

For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats (Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)
Well it worries me so
I don't know what to do (Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)
When I asked him what was happenin' in the world today
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

My baby likes (Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
He likes it greasy (Buttered popcorn)
And sticky (Buttered popcorn)
And gooey (Buttered popcorn)
And salty (Buttered popcorn)
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like buttered popcorn
You might also like
For breakfast, lunch and a dinner too
He eats (Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)
Well it worries me so
I don't know what to do (Buttered popcorn, buttered popcorn)
When I asked him
What was happenin' in the world today
He said more butter, more butter, more butter, more

My baby likes (Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
(Buttered popcorn)
He likes it greasy (Buttered popcorn)
And sticky (Buttered popcorn)
And gooey (Buttered popcorn)
And salty (Buttered popcorn)
I said what do you like
He says you know what I like
I like (Buttered popcorn)Embed
