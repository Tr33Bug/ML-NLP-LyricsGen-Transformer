Children’s Christmas Song LyricsDing dong, ding dong, hear the bell
Ringing out the first Noel
Joyous chimes ring loud and clear
Spreading word the Saviour's here
Humble men kneel down to pray
On this very special day
Wise men bearing gifts of love
Following a star above
(Spoken)
Now come on kids, I want you to gather around me, and fold your legs on the
Floor. And we're gonna tell the story about the first Christmas. Alright
Chico, open your book. Joy, Berry, Terry, everybody open your book and we're
Gonna sing the song. And when I say "Ding and Dong", I want you to say the same
With me. Alright ready? Aaha now, open your books. Good, let's go, yeah. Now!
Ding dong, ding dong, hear the bell
Ringing out the first Noel
Joyous chimes ring loud and clear
Spreading word the Saviour's here
Humble men kneel down to pray
On this very special day
Wise men bearing gifts of love
Following a star above
Very good, now darlings. And now we're gonna sing "Ding Dong" to all the children around the world, and wish them a very merry Christmas, alright? Ready?
