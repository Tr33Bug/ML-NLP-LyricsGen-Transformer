Floy Joy Lyrics
Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!
Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy!
You're the man
I know I'll never own you Floy
But see me when you can
Ooh, ooh, I know
I'm only one of a million girls
Who would give their world to you Floy Joy
Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

That's your name
Your real name may be Smith or Jones
But not your claim to fame
Oh, it's a joy boy!
Any girl who knew you at all
Would have to call you Floy Joy!

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

You don't leave a girl too much choice now, Floy

Floy, Floy, Floy (ah yeah)
Floy Joy

I get a thrill when I hear your voice now, Floy
You might also like
Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

How much joy
Do I get from you
You give me
So much pleasure
It's impossible to measure

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

You're the man
I hope in someway form or fashion
I fit in your plan
Ooh, take me
I wanna give myself to you
And live my whole life through with you
I do Floy Joy

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy
I wanna give myself to you along my Floy

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

I'm yours to call your very own now
Oh Floy

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

A-let me hear you say it one more time
Say it again

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy

A-let me hear you say it one more time
Say it again

Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy Joy
Floy, Floy, Floy
Floy JoyEmbed
