Forever Came Today Lyrics
There you were, standing there as your eyes reached out to me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart right then and there
All the love I never knew
I found in you
Suddenly, my world stood still
My life was then fulfilled
As you gently touched my hand
I knew that we had laid a plan
For everlasting love
That I've been forever dreaming of
At last, ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life a paradise (Forever came today)
It came today (Forever came today)
Forever came today (Forever came today, forever came today)

As we were standing there, you didn't speak a single word
But your eyes, your eyes said you wanted me
Your touch said you needed me
And my heart said tenderly
Darlin', ooh, my darlin', make me yours
Let your kiss touch my face
And tell me love has led me to this place
To your warm embrace
And our happiness
Thanks to you, my search has ended
And I want the world to see
How gently love has shined on me
With everlasting love
That I've been forever dreaming of

At last, ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life a paradise (Forever came today)
It came today (Forever came today)
Forever came today (Forever came today, forever came today)
At last, ooh, at last (At last, at last)
My forever came today (My forever came today)
When you walked into my life (When you walked into my life)
And made my lonely life a paradise (Forever came today)
Oh, it came today (Forever came today)
Forever came today (Forever came today, forever came today)
At last, ooh, at last
My forever came today (My forever came today)You might also likeEmbed
