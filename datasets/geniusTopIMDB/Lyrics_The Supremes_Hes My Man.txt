Heâ€™s My Man LyricsHey!
Yeah--
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh!
He's my man
He's my man
He's my man
(He's my man)
He's my man
As I go through the week
Counting all the days
Seeing the same old faces
Seeing the same old way-ay-ays
Now other men mean well
But always bring me down--
They have nothing new to say
They're still hangin' 'round
And when I need cheering up
When I'm feeling kinda low
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
And you can see us glow wherever we may go
He's my man!
All I need is that he shine his smile on me
When I'm all alone needing company
And he's the only man who can make me feel
That his love is honest
That his love is real
And when my spirit's sinking down
Need a lift off the ground---
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
And you can see us glow wherever we may go
He's my man!
You might also likeHe and I belong together
He and I will be forever
My friends all say he's no good
But they'd have him if they could--
But he's my man! Oo-oo-oo-ooh!
He's my man
Ah-ahhh!
He's my man
He's my man
He's my man
He's my man
He is my man
He's my man
Yes he is now
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
Can't you see it?
And you can see us glow wherever we may go
He's my man-an-an-an-an-an! Yeah!
He's my man
Ah-ahhhh!
He's my man
He's my man
He's my man
He's my man
He is my man
He's my man
He's my man
He calls says get dressed and I put on my best, whoo!
He's my man
Being in his arms brings out all my charms!
He's my manEmbed
