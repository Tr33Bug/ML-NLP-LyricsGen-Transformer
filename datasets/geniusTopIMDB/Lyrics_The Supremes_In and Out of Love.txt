In and Out of Love LyricsKeep falling in and out of love (Keep falling in and out of love)
In search for what I'm dreaming of
I long to find a love I'm sure about
That certain kind of love that moves all doubts
Keep falling in and out of love (Keep falling in and out of love)
Still searchin' for that special one (Searchin' for that special one)
To whom I can give my love completely
And feel a lasting love so sweetly
Just when I feel sure love's here to stay (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
It seems to suddenly just fade away (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
Can't seem to find that everlasting love (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
That this heart of mine needs so much of (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
Keep falling in and out of love (Keep falling in and out of love)
Can't seem to find the lasting kind (Can't seem to find the lasting kind)
It seems I can't find the joy I need
Love always somehow all goes wrong for me
(Keep falling in and out of love)
(Keep falling in and out of love)
Ooh, I keep reaching out for tenderness
Touching a hand that holds emptiness
Well, I'm looking for a love that lingers on (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
Long after that first kiss is gone (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
That kind of love that keeps burning bright (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
Long after we've said goodnight (Still searchin', searchin' for love)
Keep falling in and out of love (Keep falling in and out of love)
In search for what I'm dreaming of (Keep falling in and out of love)
