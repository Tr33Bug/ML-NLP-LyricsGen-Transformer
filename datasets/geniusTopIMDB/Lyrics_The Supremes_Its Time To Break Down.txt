Itâ€™s Time To Break Down LyricsFor your lovin' , oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, when you touch me
I'm at the crossroads of life
And I don't know if I should go left or right
My mind is confused, my heart is, too
Why your voice is ringin', ringin' in my ear
It's time to break down, time to say yeah
Time to take time (Time to take time)
Give my heart a chance to breathe
Feel this fire inside of me
I'll never be free (from wanting you)
My heart is your prisoner, yeah
You're like a light in my pathway
You're like a fire that gets higher day after day
I pretend I don't see this spell you cast over me
But the truth is you see all upon my face
It's time to break down, time to say yeah
Oh baby, time to take time (time to take time)
Ooo, I'll never be free from wanting you
My heart is your prisoner, ooh-ooo
It's time to break down
Say yeah when you touch me, baby
Break down for your lovin'
Mmm, say yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, ooo, yeah, yeah
Break down for your lovin'
Say yeah, ooo, baby
Break down for your lovin'

Say yeah when you touch me
Oh, yeah, say yeah when you touch me
