Love Is Here and Now Youâ€™re Gone Lyrics
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darling
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darling
Now, now you're gone (Now you're gone)
You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waitin' there

(Look what you've done)
You closed the door to your heart
(Look what you've done)
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darlin'
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
You made me love you (You made me love you)
And oh, my darlin', now you're gone (Now you're gone)
You said lovin' you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

(Look what you've done)
You stripped me of my dreams
(Look what you've done)
You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me, see what lovin' you has done to me
Look at my face (Look at my face)
See how cryin' has left its trace (Left its trace)
After you made me all your own (Made me all your own)
Then you left me all alone (Left me all alone)
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
You might also like
(Look what you've done)
My heart cries out for your touch
(Look what you've done)
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darlin'
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)
Love is here (Love is here), and oh, my darlin'
Now you're gone (Now you're gone)

You made me love you (You made me love you)
Oh, my darlin', now you're gone (Now you're gone)
You made me love you  (You made me love you)
Ooh, oh, my darlin', now you're gone (Now you're gone)...Embed
