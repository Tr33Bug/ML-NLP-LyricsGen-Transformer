Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart LyricsThe love bug done bit me
Didn't mean for him to get me
Whoo!
Get up in the morning and I'm filled with desire
No, no, I can't stop the fire
Love is a real live wire
Oooh, it's a burning sensation far beyond imagination
Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it
Keeps me sighing, (Oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Keeps me crying
Keeps me yearning, keeps me burning
No, mama can't help me
(Keeps me tossing, keeps me turning.)
No, daddy can't help me
(Keeps me yearning, keeps me burning.)
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information to help me out of this situation
Now when you're ill, you take a pill
When you're thirsty, drink your fill
What you gonna do, oh yeah
When love gets a hold, a hold on you?
Love is like an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it
Love is a nagging irritation causing my heart complication
Love is a growing infection and I don't know the correction
Got me rocking and a-reeling and I can't shake the feeling
Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it
Keeps me sighing, (Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Keeps me crying
Keeps me yearning, keeps me burning
Keeps me tossing, keeps me turning
Keeps me yearning, (keeps me burning.)
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information to help me out of this situation
Love is a nagging irritation causing my heart complication
