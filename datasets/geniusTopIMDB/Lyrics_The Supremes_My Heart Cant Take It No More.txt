My Heart Canâ€™t Take It No More LyricsStop hurting me
Now don't you think you're overdoing it?
I still care
I must admit
I know that if we ever break up
I know you'll never make up
And I'm sorry
So sorry
But my heart can't take it no more
How the times you lied
You know how many times
I cried
Lonely tears brought me misery
Maybe one day you realize
Just how I really tried, darling
To make you happy
I gave my heart
You only took it
And destroyed it
And now you say it's me you love
Yet you cheated
And deceived me
And now you say you want to keep me
And I'm sorry
So sorry
But my heart can't take it no more
My heart can't take it no more
My heart can't take it no moreYou might also likeEmbed
