My World Is Empty Without You Lyrics
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe

And as I go my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear
I miss so much
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe

From this whole world I try to hide my face (I need you, babe)
But from this loneliness, there's no hiding place (I need you, babe)
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell (I need you, babe)
In darkness with memories I know so well (I need you, babe)

I need love now more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe

My mind and soul have felt like this (I need you, babe)
Since love between us no more exists (I need you, babe)
And each time that darkness falls (I need you, babe)
It finds me alone with these four walls (I need you, babe)

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe, without you, babe
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Without you, babe, without you, babe
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Without you, babe, without you, babe
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Without you, babeYou might also likeEmbed
