Run, Run, Run Lyrics
Girls, gather 'round me
And hear the news
He finally kissed me
Oh, happy days
My heart's gotta shout it
I'll get my diary
And write about it

Well as your friends
We want to say
He'll break your heart one day
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, but he's such a quiet kind of guy
How he thrills me, my oh my
Maybe it isn't true
What they say about him

Don't be fooled
By the shyness in his eyes
Don't you know
He's just a devil in disguise
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Well as your friends
We want to say
He'll make a fool of you one day
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

No no no
But how can I run away
When I love him more each day
So with him I'm gonna stay
I'll take my chances along the way
He won my heart from the start
From him I will never never part
I love him so, love him so
Never let him go
Every time he gets nearer
My love gets dearer, so much dearer
Oh no no noYou might also likeEmbed
