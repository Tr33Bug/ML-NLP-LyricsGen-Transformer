Standing at the Crossroads of Love Lyrics
I'm standing at the crossroads of love
I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Don't know which way to go
Don't know which way to turn
Though the love I give is not returned
For that boy
My heart still yearns

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
'Cause when I'm with him he mistreats me
Runs around and cause me misery
But I love him
I can't deny
And without him
I'd surely die
It hurts to be with him
And it hurts to be without him
So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Just standing at the crossroads of love
Don't know which way
Don't know which way to go
Don't know which way
Don't know which way to turn

There's always tears on my pillow
'Cause I'm always in the middle
Of heartache and emotion
Heartbreak and devotion
Loving, caring, when it's despairing
Trying to be true
Though it makes me blue

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Just standing at the crossroads of love
Don't know which way to turn
Don't know which way to turn
I'm standing at the crossroadsYou might also likeEmbed
