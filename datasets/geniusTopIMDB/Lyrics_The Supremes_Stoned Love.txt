Stoned Love Lyrics
Now I wanna tell you of a great love
Oh, it will light up
It will surely light up
The world
If you'll just believe

Stoned love
(Stoned love)
Mm-hmm
Mm-hmm
Stoned love
Oh, yeah
A love for each other will bring fighting to an end
Forgiving one another, time after time, doubt creeps in
But like the sun lights up the sky with a message from above
Oh, yeah, I find no other greater symbol of this love

Yeah, don't you hear the wind blowin'?
Mm-hmm
Stoned love, oh, yeah
I tell you, I ain't got no other
Mm-hmm
Stoned love, oh, yeah

Life is so short, put the present time at hand
Oh, yeah, and if you're young at heart, rise up and take your stand
And to the man on whose shoulder the world must depend
I pray for peace and love, amen

Can't you feel it?
Stoned love
I tell you, I ain't got no other
Uh-huh
Stoned love, oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You might also like
If a war 'tween our nations passed, oh, yeah
Will the love 'tween our brothers and sisters last?
On and on and on and on and

Mm, mm, mm
Stoned love, yeah
I tell you, I ain't got no other
Mm-hmm
Stoned love
Can't you, can't you, can't you, can't you, can't you feel it?
Mm-hmm
Stoned love
Oh, yeah, stoned, stoned, stoned, stoned
Mm-hmm
Stoned love
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh
Stoned love
Oh, yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Mm-hmmEmbed
