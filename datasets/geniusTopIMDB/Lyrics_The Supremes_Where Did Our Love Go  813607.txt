Where Did Our Love Go - 813607 LyricsBaby, baby
Baby, don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself
I've got this burning, burning
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me
Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me
Don't you want me no more?
Ooh, baby
Baby, baby
Where did our love go?
And all your promises
Of a love forever more
I've got this burning, burning
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind
You might also likeOoh, baby, baby
Baby, don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself
Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
And all your promises
Of a love forever more1Embed
