Where Did Our Love Go Lyrics
Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee

Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me

Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me?
Don't you want me no more?
Ooh, baby

Baby, baby
Where did our love go
And all your promises
Of a love forever more

I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
You might also like
Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind
(Baby, baby) ooh baby

Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?2Embed
