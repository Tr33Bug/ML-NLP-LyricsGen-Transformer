You Keep Me Hanginâ€™ On Lyrics
Set me free, why don'tcha, baby?
Get out my life, why don'tcha, baby?
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hanging on

Why do you keep a-coming around
Playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start?
Letting me get over you
The way you've gotten over me, hey
Set me free, why don't cha, baby?
Let me be, why don't cha, baby? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging on (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Now, you don't really want me
You just keep me hanging on

You say, although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
And there ain't nothin' I can do about it

(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Set me free, why don't cha, baby?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Get out my life, why don't cha baby? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Set me free, why don'tcha, baby?
Get out my life, why don'tcha, baby?

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else, hey-ey
You might also like
Why don't you be a man about it
And set me free? (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Now, you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me (Ooh-woo, ooh)
Go on, get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night, please (Ooh-woo, ooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hanging onEmbed
