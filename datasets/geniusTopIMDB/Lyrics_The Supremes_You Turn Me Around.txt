You Turn Me Around LyricsWhen I feel the walls start closing in on me
And I don't like where I've been to or where I'm gonna be
When I'm heading hard for hard times
And I know I'm nowhere bound
You turn me around, you turn me around
You turn me around
You turn me around
(round and round, round and round)
Mmm, when the stray of daily living takes its toll
(story of daily living)
And the crazy fears that haunt me begin to chill my soul
And I, I don't know what I'm fighting
I just know I'm losing ground
You turn me around, you turn me around
You turn me around
You turn me around
(whenever I'm with you turns me around)
Just your head on my shoulder (my shoulder)
Just your eyes reaching into mine
Makes a little kid in me grow older
And before I know it, I'll step right back in time
And when I see the way the people carry on
When it seems that human kindness is all but dead and gone
Just the sight of you reminds me
Something good can still be found
You turn me around, turn me around
Turn me around
Ooh, you turn me around
