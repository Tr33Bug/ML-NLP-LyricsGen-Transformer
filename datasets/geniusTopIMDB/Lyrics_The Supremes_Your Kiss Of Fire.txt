Your Kiss Of Fire Lyrics
La la-la-la-la, la la-la-la-la, la

When you first gave it to me (To me)
Your sweet kiss of fire
The burning flame of love
Started mounting higher (Ooh-oo-oo)
'Til it consumed my heart and soul (And soul)
And like King Midas loved his gold (His gold)
I wanted you alone to hold
And your kiss of fire (And your kiss of fire)
Your sweet kiss of fire (Your sweet kiss of fire)
Your sweet kiss of fire (Your sweet kiss of fire)

And then you took it away (Away)
Your sweet kiss of fire
Taking the thrill out of love
Killing my desire (Ooh-oo-oo)
I'm like a leaf without a tree (A tree)
Like a fish without the sea (The tree)
I'm as cold as cold can be

Without your kiss of fire (Without your kiss of fire)
Your sweet kiss of fire (Your sweet kiss of fire)
Your sweet kiss of fire (Your sweet kiss of fire)

Please don't forsake me
After showing me the way to love
Just come on and make me
Warm as the sun that shines above

Bring it, bring it to me
Your sweet kiss of fire
Stop this hurt within me
Bring back my desire (Ooh-oo-oo)
It's you that I adore (Adore)
I'll do anything you implore (Implore)
If you'll just give to me once more
You might also like
Your sweet kiss of fire (Your sweet kiss of fire)
Your sweet kiss of fire (Kiss of fire, sweet kiss of fire)
Fire, oh yeah (Fire, fire)Embed
