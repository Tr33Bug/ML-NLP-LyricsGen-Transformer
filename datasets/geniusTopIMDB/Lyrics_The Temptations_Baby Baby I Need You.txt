Baby, Baby I Need You LyricsI need you
Oh oh, I need you
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know
That I need you (so), (so), (so), (so)
I want you
Oh oh, I want you
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know
That I want you (so), (so), (so), (so)

You knew my lips were lonely for, the kisses you could give to me
Ever since the first day, baby, that we met
So if you say you're mine and let our hearts combine
I swear I'll never let you forget how much...
I love you
Oh oh, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know
That I love you (so), (so), (so), (so)
I need you
Oh oh, I want you
 Baby, baby, baby
 Baby
Oh oh, I love you
 Darling, darling
 Oh, darling
Oh oh, oh
Come home, come home, come home, come home
 Can't you see that I need it
 Bring it home to me, baby
Come home, come home, come home, come home
 I really really love you, baby
 Hey, baby
Come home, come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home, come homeYou might also likeEmbed
