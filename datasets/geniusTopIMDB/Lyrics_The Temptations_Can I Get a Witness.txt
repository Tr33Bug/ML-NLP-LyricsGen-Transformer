Can I Get a Witness Lyrics
Listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home?
And I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see y'all treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair
Can I get a witness?
(Can I get a witness?)
Can I get a witness?
(Can I get a witness?)
Somebody, somebody
(Can I get a witness?)

Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossin' in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Then emme hear, lemme hear you say, "Yeah, hey"

Up early in the mornin'
With her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
'Cause I believe (I believe) a woman is a man's best friend
I'm gonna stick by her right here, right now
'Til the very end
But she caused me so much misery
That I forget how love's supposed to be
Lemme hear you, lemme hear you say, "Hey, hey"
You might also like
I want a witness
(I want a witness)
Can I get a witness?
(Witness, witness)
I want a witness
(I want a witness)
Can I get a witness?
(Witness, witness)

Everybody knows, especially you girls
That love can be sad
But I have a love that's twice as bad
All you chicks agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Lemme hear you, lemme hear you say, "Yeah, hey"

(I want a witness, can I get a witness?)
Can I get a witness? (I want a witness)
Somebody (Can I get a witness?)
In the mornin' (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
Around about noon (I want a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness?)
In the evenin' (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
In the midnight hour (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
I need somebody to hold me (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
I need someone to squeeze me (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
Need someone to tease me (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
I, I, I, I, I, I (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
True sweetness (I want a witness)
Kiss my face (Can I get a witness?)
I need you (I want a witness)
All over the place (Can I get a witness?)
I just need somebody (I want a witness)
To hold me tight (Can I get a witness?)
On the cold, cold (I want a witness)
Cold and windy night (Can I get a witness?)
I need you, (I want a witness)
I need a witness (Can I get a witness?)
Early in the mornin' (I want a witness)
Satisfied (Can I get a witness?)
I just want somebody to hold me tight
I need somebody to squeeze at night
I had a little girl when I was, you know
When time's to come and who's to be
I remember I am, girl, set me free
She makes me move like I never did
She give me everything I want, then
I want a witness, I need a witness
Somebody, somebody
So baby, I gotta move
I gotta move, I wanna move
(Court's in session, I need a witness)
I need a witness, I gotta move
(Court's in session, I need a witness)
I need a witness
I need it, I need
I need a witness, I gotta move
(Court's in session, I need a witness)
I need a witness
(Court's in session, I need a witness)
(Court's in session, I need a witness)
Somebody, I gotta move
(Court's in session, I need a witness)
Somebody, I gotta move
I need a witness
I need somebody
Oh, somebodyEmbed
