Cloud Nine LyricsThe childhood part of my life
It wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised
In the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept
Ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food
Or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease
My troubled mind
Mmm, listen
My father didn't know
The meaning of work
He disrespected Mama
And treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job
That I never did find
Depressed and downhearted
I took to Cloud Nine
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine
Listen, one more time
I'm doing fine
Up here, on Cloud Nine
Folks down there tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance, son
Don't let life pass you by
But the world of reality is a rat race
Where only the strongest survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world
And that ain't no lie
Listen, it ain't even safe no more
To walk the streets at night"

Let me tell you about Cloud Nine
(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud Nine)
You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud Nine)
And every man, every man is free
(Cloud Nine)
And you're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away
Cloud Nine
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud Nine
I-I-I-I-I, I'm riding high
(On Cloud Nine)
You're as free as a bird in flight
(Cloud Nine)
There's no difference between day and night
(Cloud Nine)
It's a world of love and harmony
(Cloud Nine)
You're a million miles from reality
(Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher
Upper, up, up, and away
(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud Nine)
You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud Nine)
Every man in his mind is free
(Cloud Nine)
You're a million miles from reality
(Cloud Nine)
You can be what you wanna be1Embed
