Donâ€™t Look Back Lyrics
If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place
(You can't run, you can't hide, you can't run, you can't hide)
Love has problems, I know, but they're problems, we'll just have to face
Oh yeah, yeah

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We're gonna walk and don't look back (Don't look back)
And don't look back (Don't look back), oh yeah, yeah
And don't look back, baby (Don't look back)
(The past is behind you, don't let them remind you)
If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done

So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking, don't look back (Don't look back)
Forget about the past now
Don't look back, baby (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and don't look back, mmm (Don't look back)
(The past behind you, don't let them remind you)

Love can be a beautiful thing
Though your first love let you down
Oh yeah, yeah
(You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide)
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby
The second time around
Oh yeah, yeah

So if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on pushing and don't look back (Don't look back)
Now, what'd I say, we won't look back, girl (Don't look back)
Keep on walking and won't look back
Forget about the past now, baby (Don't look back)
And don't look back (Don't look back)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look backYou might also likeEmbed
