I Canâ€™t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch) LyricsSugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
Come and you go
Leavin' just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye, I come-a runnin' to you
I'm tied to your apron string
And there's nothing that I can do
Can't help myself
No, I can't help myself
'Coz sugarpie, honeybunch
Weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face
I get up all choked up inside
When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
Burnin' in my heart, tearin' it all apart
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide
'Coz sugarpie, honeybunch
You know that I'm weak for you
Can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
Sugarpie, honeybunch
Do anything you ask me to
Can't help myself
I want you and nobody else

You know that I love you
Can't help myself
No, I can't help myselfEmbed
