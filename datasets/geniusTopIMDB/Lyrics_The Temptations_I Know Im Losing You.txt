(I Know) Iâ€™m Losing You Lyrics
Ooh
Your love is fading, I can feel your love fading
Girl, it's fading away from me

'Cause your touch, your touch has grown cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
It's there when you speak my name
It's just not the same
Ooh, baby, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Ooh baby, I'm losing you
(Losing you)

When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurt, down-hearted and worried, girl
Cause that face doesn't belong to me

Oh, it's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Woo, ooh, baby, I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness inside
Ooh, I can tell I'm losing you
Ooh (Losing you)
I don't wanna lose you
Ooh, I can tell when we kiss
From the tenderness I miss
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
Girl, I can feel it in my bones
Any day you'll be gone
Oh, baby, I'm losing you
You might also likeOh, my dear
What happened to the love we shared?
Oh, baby, I'm losing you
I know it's true
There's someone new
Oh baby, baby, baby, I'm losing you1Embed
