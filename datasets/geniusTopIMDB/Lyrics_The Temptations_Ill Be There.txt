Iâ€™ll Be There Lyrics
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world and dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you, baby
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, girl, it's all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Oh, baby, I'll be there to protect you
(Oh, you better believe it when I say)
With this unselfish love
That will always respect you, baby
(I'm down on my knees, trying explain to you, darling)
Just call my name and I'll be there

I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world and dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Holding on, holding on, holding on
Holding on

If you should find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
(Good to you)
Oh yeah, guess what?
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there
You can count on me, baby
(Baby, yeah)
You might also like
I'll be there
(Through the rain, through the sleet, through the snow)
I'll be there
(You can count on me anywhere you go, all the way)
Just call my name, I'll be there
(Call my name, I'll be there)
(Just pick up the telephone, girl)
(You know you need somebody, ooh)
I'll be there
(I'll be standing on your door step, darling)
I'll be there
(You'll find it out, I hear you call my name)
Just call my name, I'll be there
(I'll be there, baby, right away)
Look over you shoulder, baby
I'll be there with open arms
Can't nobody take that away from me
(Just call my name, I'll be there)
Just call my name, call my name, call my name
I'll be there
(I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there)
I'll be there
(I don't wanna be no other place, baby)
I'll be there
(I don't care what you're going through)
I'll be there
(I will always be a pillow to you, baby)
I'll be there
(If times are good, if times are bad)
Just call my name
(You can always call me, darling)
I'll be thereEmbed
