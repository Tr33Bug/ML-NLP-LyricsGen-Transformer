Iâ€™ll Love You Til I Die Lyrics
Now that you've come back home to me
I don't care what the people say

'Cause I'm gonna love you (Love you 'til I die)
Hey, love you baby (Love you 'til I die)
With every little breath that I take, I'm gonna love you (Love you 'til I die)
Hey, just as long as I can see you now (Love you 'til I die)
As long as you stay with me, baby (Love you 'til I die)
Well, I'm gonna lose my faith in you
If you ever leave me, my whole life would be through
But right now I'm gonna love you (Love you)
Hey (Love you, love you)

I'm gonna love you right now (Love you 'til I die)
Yeah, love you baby (Love you 'til I die)
Yeah, each and every day I'm gonna love you (Love you 'til I die)

Just as long as I can put my arms around you, I'm gonna love you (Love you 'til I die)
Yeah, loving you (Love you 'til I die)

Well, I'm gonna lose every bit of my faith in you
If you ever leave me, my whole life would be through
But right now I'm gonna love you (Love you)
Hey (Love you, love you)

I'll love you right now (Love you 'til I die)
Yeah, love you right now (Love you 'til I die)
All you have to do is keep on loving me, baby
And I'll love you (Love you 'til I die)
