Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me) Lyrics
Oooh

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy"
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you

But it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
Ooh (Soon)
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children, maybe three
I tell you I (I, I) can visualize it all
This couldn't be a dream, for too real it all seems

But it was just my imagination, once again
Runnin' away with me
Tell you, it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me

Ev'ry night on my knees I pray
"Dear Lord, hear my plea
Don't ever let another take her love from me"
Or I will surely die, hmm
(Her love is) heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesn't even know me

(Just my imagination) Once again
Runnin' away with me, oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
You might also like
Iâ€™ve never met her but I can't forget her
(Just my imagination) Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runnin' away with me, ooh
Just my imagination
Runnin' away with me
She's never hard to find (Just my imagination)
She's always on my mind (Runnin' away with me)6Embed
