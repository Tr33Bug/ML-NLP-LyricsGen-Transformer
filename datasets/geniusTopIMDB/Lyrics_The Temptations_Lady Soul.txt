Lady Soul Lyrics
Whoa whoa oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh
My lady soul

Lying here beside you
Close as we can be
I know what this leads to
I know what you need, yeah
I'm ready to remember, my love
Lay it all on your hands
Give you mine forever
Everything I am
'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
Oh, you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole
Whoa whoa oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh, my lady soul

I fell it in you heartbeat
Hear it in your cries
This is where our hearts meet
I see it in your eyes
I've been waiting for this moment, my love
It's a dream come alive
Heaven must have sent me
An angel of the night

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul
You're my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole, oh, mmm

I always knew we'd end up together
Right from the very start
And I believe we'll make it forever
It's written right here in my heart
Oh yeah
You might also like
You're my, you're my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
Oh, you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole
Whoa whoa oh oh
Whoa whoa oh oh, my lady soul

Ooh ooh ooh (my, my)
Ooh ooh ooh (My, my)
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
(My, My) My lady soul
(My, My...My, My...My, My)
Oh my, my, my lady soulEmbed
