Law of the Land Lyrics
Some people will always have it made
Some people will live in poverty for the rest of their days
Time marches on
Yesterday is dead and gone
Life is uncertain, let me hear you say (Yeah)
Death is final, yes it is
There'll be days of sunshine and laughter
But don't forget you gonna have to shed some tears, oh ho

It's the law of the land (My brother, oh)
Whether you like it or you'll understand (Ah hey hey)
It's the law of the land (Hey hey hey hey)
Laws made by almighty man
Live by the good book if you're able
You must play your cards on top of the table
When you gamble you either win or lose
In life's everybody's got to pay some dues - well

It's the law of the land (Well well well)
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand (You can't change it)
It's the law of the land (Ah-how)
Laws made by almighty man (Oh, hey)


Hey, it's the law, the law of the land
Whether you'll like it or you'll understand
It's the law, the law of the land
Was made by almighty men

A peace of mind can't be found
Until you find yourself - think about it
You might not like being who you are but you better start liking it
'Cause you sure can't be nobody else
In other words: I can't be you - ain't no way, yeah - you can't be me
Well well, that's all with you, my sisters and brother
And that's the way that good Lord meant to be - hey-ho
You might also like
It's the law of the land (Well)
Whether you like it or you'll understand (Say say)
It's the law of the land (Hey)
Laws made by almighty man

Looka here
The course of a man's day is driven by a cup
For your own protection your doors you must lock
What goes around comes around
You know what goes up, yeah, must come down - ah-ha

It's the law of the land (Well well well well)
Whether you like it or you'll understand
(Everybody sing along with me)
It's the law of the land (Well well well)
Laws made by almighty man (Ah-ha)
It's the law of the landEmbed
