Message from a Black Man LyricsYes, my skin is black
But that's no reason to hold me back
Why don't you think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it
I have wants and desires just like you
So move on aside 'cause I'm a comin' through
Oh, no matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Yes, your skin is white
Does that make you right?
Why don't you think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it
This is a message, a message to y'all
Together we stand, divided we fall
Black is a color, just like white
Tell me how can a color determine whether
You're wrong or right?
We all have our faults, yes we do
So look in your mirror (Look in your mirror)
What do you see? (What do you see?)
Two eyes (Two eyes), a nose (a nose)
And a mouth just like me
Oh, your eyes are open but you refuse to see
The laws of society were made for both you and me
Because of my color, I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But in the end you're gonna see my friend
Oh, no matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(We're rollin', rollin', rollin', we're rollin' on)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(Oh, we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
(Can't stop me, can't stop me)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud! (I'm Black and I'm proud)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud! (I'm Black and I'm proud)
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud! (I'm Black and I'm proud)
