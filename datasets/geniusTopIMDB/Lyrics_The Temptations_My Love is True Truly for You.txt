My Love is True (Truly for You) Lyrics
When will you learn
I'm never gonna leave you, girl
Please open your eyes and see
You're the only one for me, baby
Of all the things we've been through
It's made my love strong for you
We all need someone to depend on
You can count on me, baby

My love is true
My love is true
My love is true, ooh
Truly, truly, truly for you
Girl, don't you know
We're standing underneath a halo
We've been blessed to have this love affair
I can't let go, go nowhere
Blessing comes in many disguises
I'm so glad I recognize it
You're something special and very rare
What we got, baby, you don't fine anywhere

My Love is true (Only for you)
My love is true
My Love is true (Oh baby)
Truly, truly, truly for you

So girl, take my love
(Take my love)
No matter where your heart may roam
Deep down inside of me baby, yeah
Your love will always have a home
If ever a story should be told
Whatever time may unfold
Let it be said, girl, I always loved you
You can count on me, baby
'Cause my love is true
You might also like
My love is true
My love is true
My love is true
You can always count on me, baby
Truly for you
Truly, truly, truly for you
My love is true
My love is true, baby
My love is true, ooh
Only for you
Truly, truly, truly for you
All my love is true
My love is true
Love is forever with you, baby
My love is true, ooh
Oh yeah
Truly, truly, truly for you

Yes, I know that time bring by a change
But there's one thing that will remain the same
And that's how I truly, truly love you
You're my world, you're my girl, you're my all and all and all
You're my pot of gold
At the end of loves rainbow
And I couldn't dream of coming home
At the end of the day and you not be thereEmbed
