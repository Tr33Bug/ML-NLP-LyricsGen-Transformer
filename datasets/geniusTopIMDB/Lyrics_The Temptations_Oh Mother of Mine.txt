Oh, Mother of Mine Lyrics
Oh, mother

Oh mother of mine, I've, I've been blind
The things that you tell me, yeah, I paid, I really paid it no mind
Oh please, oh please forgive me, yes, I know I was wrong
But now, now I know, yeah, my place, my place is at home

Can't you see I've been crying now (Oh yes, he's been crying)
Almost dying (Uh-huh, almost dying)
I need your advice, mama, yeah (He needs your advice)
(He needs your advice)
Oh, mama (Please, Mother)
Oh, mama (Please, Mother)
Oh, mama (Please, Mother)
Come on and tell me, now

How much about love, you don't understand?
Yes, you knew that you were wrong
Oh, when you thought you were wrong
Yes, it was that young girl
She put you in such a whirl

Yeah, I said, mama, don't you worry now, yeah
I guess I had it coming anyhow, yes I did
I'm gonna do everything you say
Hmmm, each and every day

I'm gonna be a man, yes, I am (Oh yes, he's gonna be a man)
Now that I understand (Now that he understands)
Ooh, I'm not gonna be no fool no more (He's not fool no more)
Yeah because you told me so (Like, like he was before)
