Psychedelic Shack Lyrics


Hold it everybody, hold it, hold it, listen
One, two, three, four!
Uh!
Well, well
Yeah
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Yeah
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at

People, let me tell you 'bout a place I know
To get in, it don't take much dough
Where you can really do your thing, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh yeah)
It's got a neon sign outside that says "Come in and take a look at your mind"
You'll be surprised what you might find, yeah (Yeah)
Strobe lights flashing from sun up to sun down
People gather there from all parts of town (Oh yeah)

Right around the corner
You know it's just across the track
People, I'm talking about the psychedelic shack
Get back
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at (Get on down)
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at (Mmmm, mmmm)
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Yeah (Oh yeah)
You might also like
You can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
There ain't no such a thing as time
Oh, incense in the air (Mmmm, hmmm)
Peace signs painted everywhere
I guarantee you this place will blow your mind
They got music so high you can't get over it
So low you can't get under it, uh-huh

Let me tell you, it's
Right around the corner, (Oh yeah)
Just across the track
People, I'm talking 'bout the psychedelic shack
Get psyched
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Millionaires, kings and queens
Go there to do their thing
You might see anybody there, yeah, yeah
Bear skin rugs, tails and minks
Ooh, don't really matter what you wear
Oh, you can take off your shoes, sit on the floor
Join in and be what you wanna be
Don't you know that it's
Right around the corner (Oh yeah)
Just across the tracks
People, I'm talking about the psychedelic shack
Now, get back
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Yeah (Oh yeah)

They got a cat that's shouting the blues
Talking 'bout paying some dues
People walking around reciting poetry, yeah
Ooh, screaming guitars, and a thousand coloured lights
People, I'm telling you this place is really out of sight, yeah
Hey, you can have your fortune told
You can learn the meaning of soul
I guarantee you this place will blow your mind

Don't you know it's
Right around the corner (Oh yeah)
Just across the tracks
People, I'm talking about the psychedelic shack

They got music so high you can't get over it
So low you can't get under itEmbed
