Shakey Ground Lyrics
Lady Luck and four leaf clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
'Til you leavin' left me this situation
(Oh, ho, ho)

I'm standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Waaa!
My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Girl, you better throw me a life preserver
'Cause I'm about to drown in my own tears
(Ah, ha, ah)

I'm standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Ooh, hoo


Now, now, now
Standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down, wow
Said I'm standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down, whoo hoo
(Standin' on shakey ground)
Standin', well
(Ever since you put me down)
On shakey ground
Standin', standin', standing on shakey ground, waa!
You might also like

Got to say it, got to say it, got to say it, got to say it
I'm standin' on shakey ground, woo!
Ever since you put me down, and ah ha
Standin' on shakey ground
Ever since you put me downEmbed
