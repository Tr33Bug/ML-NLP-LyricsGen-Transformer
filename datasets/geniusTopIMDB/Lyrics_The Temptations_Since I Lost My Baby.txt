Since I Lost My Baby Lyrics
The sun is shining (Oh yeah)
There's plenty of light
A new day is dawning
Sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold
And the new day seems old

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
The birds are singing
And the children are playing (Doo-doo-doo)
There's plenty of work
And the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should
A young heart be saying
But fun is a bore
And with money I'm poor

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)

Next time I'll be kinder
(Next time I'll be kinder)
Won't you please help me find her
(Won't you please help me find her)
Someone just remind her
(Someone just remind her)
Of this love she left behind her
(Of this love she left behind her)
'Til I find her I'll be trying
('Til I find her I'll be trying)
Every day I'm more inclined to find her
Inclined to find her
(Inclined to find my baby)
Been looking everywhere (Baby)
Baby, I really, really care
You might also like
Oh, determination is fading fast (Oh yeah)
Inspiration is a thing of the past (Oh yeah)
Can't see how my hope's gonna last
Good things are bad
And what's happy is sad

Since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)
Oh, since I lost my baby
(Since I lost my baby)

I feel so bad (Since I lost my baby)
I feel so sad (Since I lost my baby)
Everything is wrong (Since I lost my baby)
This heart is hard to carry on (Since I lost my baby)
I'm lost as can be (Since I lost my baby)
What's gonna happen to me?Embed
