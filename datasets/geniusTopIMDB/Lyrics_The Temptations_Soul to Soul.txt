Soul to Soul Lyrics
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Soul to Soul (Soul to soul)
Soul, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, whoa, whoa (Soul to soul)

Piece of newspaper at my feet
We go blowing down the street
Got our stories old and new
Need someone to tell 'em to
We don't have to be eye to eye (Face to face)
I'm not asking for miracles (Nor saving grace)
And I don't need another heart (To have and hold)
All I want is a friend I can talk to (Soul to soul)
Oh, soul to soul (Soul to soul)
Mmm, oh yeah

Like a notebook on a shelf
Tired of talking to myself
I'm wishing somebody (Somebody) passing by (Passing by)
Would pick me up and look inside

We don't have to be eye to eye (Or face to face)
I'm not asking for miracles (Miracles) (Or saving grace)
And I don't need another heart
(I don't need another heart) (To have and hold)
All I want is a friend I can talk to (Soul to soul)
Soul to soul (Oh, soul to soul) (Soul to soul)
Mmm

Everyone needs someone to turn to
When they walk in their line (Got to walk that line)
And we all need a friend we can cry to
And I'm out on that line (I'm on that line)
Hey hey
It's been so long now, you know I'm needing mine
You might also likeOh whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
All I want is a friend I can talk to (Soul to soul)
I just call and there you are (Soul to soul)
Shining on me like a star (Shining down)
Smile in my direction in the night (Ooh ooh ooh)
And I feel your light yeah (Oh oh, soul to soul)
I'm feeling stronger now, so much stronger now (Soul to soul)
Won't you shine a little longer, a little longer right now
I'm still holding that line (Got to hold that line) yeah
Keep me holding that line
Oh oh my

We don't have to be eye to eye (Or be face to face)
I'm not asking for miracles (Or saving grace)
And I don't need another heart (To have and hold)
All I want is someone I can talk to (Soul to soul)

Oh, I need a friend right now (Soul to soul)
Someone I can talk to (Soul to soul)
I'm feeling lonely right now (right now baby)
I just need to know you're there anytime of the day and night
I need somebody who's willing to listen
Shining, shining, shining, shining so brightly right now
I feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders
Soul to soul
Does anybody hear me calling?Embed
