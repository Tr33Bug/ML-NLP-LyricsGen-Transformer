Stay Lyrics
Ooh ooh, mmm, mmm
Yeah, hey, oh no
Na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
Ah ah, yeah yeah

Just to feel your body
Your sensual design
You know my heart goes crazy
When your tender lips touch mine
Let's explore our love
Under candlelight and wine
We'll leave the world behind, baby
(Girl, do you believe)
In the miracle of love
(Won't you try and see)
I'm the one you're dreaming of
(Baby, close your eyes)
Let the fantasy become real
Oh, yeah (Will I)

Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you (Like I wanna rock you)
(Please)
(Stay with me, baby)
Stay 'til the morning, baby, let me know
That you want me too
(I wanna rock you, baby)
(I wanna rock you, baby)

Can you feel me, baby?
'Cause I'm coming from the heart
You're such a sexy lady, ooh
Just tell me where to start
I'll make sweet, sweet love
Like you never felt before
And give you so much more, hey, hey
You might also like
(When you need a friend)
I will come to you
(You just tell me when)
Girl, that's all you got to do
(Let me be your man)
I will be your pleasure
(Anytime) Anytime, anytime you need

Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you
(Ooh, don't you wanna stay with me, girl)
(Do you wanna stay)
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Yeah), let me know
That you want me too
(Ooh, girl, I want you to stay with me, yeah)
Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you
(In the morning, in the evening, and all night long)
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Oh), let me know
That you want me too (I want you)
(I wanna rock you, baby)
(Don't you want me too?)

I'll sing it from the highest mountain (The highest mountain)
Paint the words across the sky (All across the sky)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I can't live without you (You know I can't)
I can love you through the day and all night, and all night, and all night
Of all the riches in the world, you will forever be my girl
(I wanna know)
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Baby), rock me, girl
Like I wanna rock you
(I, I wanna rock you, baby, I wanna know)
Stay 'til the morning, baby
(I wanna know if you wanna stay with me tonight), let me know
That you want me too
(Girl, rock me, rock me, rock me, and rock me)
(You better rock me, baby) (All night long)
Stay 'til the morning, baby, rock me, girl
(I'd rather, I'd rather, rather make sweet love to you)
Like I wanna rock you (I'm begging you, baby)
(Yeah, baby)
(Help me, y'all)
Stay 'til the morning, baby (Oh), let me know (Ooh)
That you want me too
(That you want it too, Temptations sing)

Stay (I want you to stay, oh, oh)
With me, ooh, ooh (I wanna be your lover, baby)
Stay (I wanna know would you stay)
With me, ooh, ooh
(I'll do just about anything you'll want me to do, yeah)
Stay (Oh, oh, oh)
(Stay with me)
(Oh, oh)
With me, ooh, ooh (Baby, forever)
(Baby, forever)
(Oh, oh, why don't you stay)
Stay (I love, I love everything about you)
With me, ooh, oohEmbed
