Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are) Lyrics
Higher, higher
Fire

Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being

Superstar, good God
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
And your chauffeur driven fancy car
But remember how you got where you are
Oh ho ho, 'cause the same folks that made you
Mhm, you better believe they can break you
No, you didn't make it all by yourself
You had help from somebody else
The truth is the light, don't let it depress you
You just be thankful that the good Lord made you

Superstar, ah, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are

Ah ah, down, down, down, down
Drummer keep it going, going
Horns starts blowin'
Right on time, blow my mind
Higher, higher, higher, higher

It's easy for you to look down
Turn up your nose and frown
Now that you're on top (Top)
(Bright lights)
Don't let the bright lights blind you
(Bridges)
Don't burn 'em behind you

Superstar, good God, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you are

Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being
Superstar, good God, do you know who your real friends are?
I'm talkin' to you
Superstar, remember how you got where you areEmbed
