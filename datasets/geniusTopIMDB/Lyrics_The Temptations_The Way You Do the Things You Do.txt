The Way You Do the Things You Do Lyrics
You've got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do
As pretty as you are (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute (Hoo-hoo)
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been a schoolbook

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do


You made my heart so rich (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been some money
And baby, you're so sweet (Hoo-hoo)
You know you could have been some honey

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do
You might also like
You really swept me off my feet (The way you do the things you do)
You made my life complete (The way you do the things you do)
You made my life so bright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)Embed
