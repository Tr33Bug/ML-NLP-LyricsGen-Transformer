War Lyrics
War, huh
What is it good for?
Nothing
War, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh, good god
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
War, I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

War, it's nothing but a heartbreak
War, friend only to the undertaker
War, is an enemy to all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest within the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?

Oh, war, huh, good God, y'all
What is it good for? (You tell 'em)
Nothing
War, good God, huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, good God
You might also like
War, it's nothing but a heartbreaker
War, friend only to the undertaker
Wars have shattered many young men's dreams
Made him disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to spend fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away

Oh, war, huh, good God
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, mhm
War, huh, good God almighty, listen
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, yeah

War, it's nothing but a heartbreaker
War, friend only to the undertaker
Peace, love and understanding, tell me
Is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows it got to be a better way
I said

War, huh, yeah yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing, say it again
War, huh, nothing but a heartbreaker
What is it good for?1Embed
