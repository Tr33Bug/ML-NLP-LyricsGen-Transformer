Candy Says Lyrics[Verse 1: Doug Yule]
Candy says "I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world"
Candy says "I'd like to know completely
What others so discreetly talk about"

[Chorus: Doug Yule]
"I'm going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me?"
[Verse 2: Doug Yule]
Candy says "I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be"
Candy says "I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind"

[Chorus: Doug Yule]
"I'm going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me?"

[Outro: Doug Yule]
Doo, doo-wop
Doo, doo, doo-wop
Doo, doo, doo-wop
Doo, doo-roo, doo-wop
Doo, doo, doo-wop
