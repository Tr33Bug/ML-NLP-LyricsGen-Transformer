Cool It Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
Somebody took the papers and somebody's got the key
And somebody's nailed the door shut
That says, "Hey, what you think that you see?"
But me, I'm down around the corner
You know, I'm looking for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
Gives me double you L O V E
Hey baby, if you want it so fast
Don't you know that it ain't going to last
Of course you know it makes no difference to me
[Verse 2]
Somebody's got the time, time
Somebody's got the right
All of the other people trying to use up the night
But now me, I'm out on the corner
You know, I'm looking for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
Gives me double you L O V E
Ooh, hey if you want it so fast
Don't you know honey, you can get it so fast
But of course, you know it makes no difference to me

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
Get down it

[Verse 3]
Ohh, hey, if you want it so fast
Now lookie look baby don't you want it to last
But of course you know that it makes no difference to me

[Chorus]
Ohh, you'd better cool it down
Now baby, better cool it down
Don't you know, you'd better cool it down
You know, you'd better cool it down

You'd better cool it down
Oh, baby cool it down
You'd better cool it downEmbed
