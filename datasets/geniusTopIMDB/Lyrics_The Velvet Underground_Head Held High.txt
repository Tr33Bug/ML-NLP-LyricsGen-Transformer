Head Held High Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mama told me, ever since I was seven
"Hold your head up high"
My parents told me, ever since I was eleven
"Hold your head up high"
They said the answer was to become a dancer
Hold your head up high
Oh, just like I figured they're always disfigured
With their head up high

[Verse 2]
Now I am older, I'm getting so much bolder
With my head up high
Oh, as I figured just like I figured
Since your head's up high, baby
Oh, now just like I figured you know they was disfigured
Hold your head high
You know they says the answer was to become a dancer
Hold your head up high, boy
[Verse 3]
Ever since I was a baby on my mama's knee
Oh, just to listen to what have everybody told me
And yes I did
But still the answer was to become a dancer
And hold your head up high
But, just like I figured they're always disfigured
They hold their heads up high
Watch out

[Bridge]
Yeah
Do the dog
Oh, watch out

[Verse 2]
And now I'm older they say that I'm so much bolder
Got your head up high
Oh, oh the answer was, hey become a dancer
Head up high
Well, but just like I figured they're always disfigured
They got their heads up high
But the answer was, now boy become a dancer
With your head up high

[Outro]
Oh head up high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Head up high, oh baby
Head up high, oh oh
Head up high, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Head up high
