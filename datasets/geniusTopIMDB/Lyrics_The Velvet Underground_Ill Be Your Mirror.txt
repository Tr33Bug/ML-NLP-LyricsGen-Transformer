Iâ€™ll Be Your Mirror Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain, and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're home

[Chorus]
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside, you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you
[Verse 2]
I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty you are
But if you don't, let me be your eyes
A hand to your darkness so you won't be afraid

[Chorus]
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside, you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

[Outro]
I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)You might also like16Embed
