Iâ€™m Sticking with You Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

[Verse]
You held up a stagecoach in the rain
And I'm doing the same
Saw you hanging from a tree
And I made believe it was me
[Chorus]
I'm sticking with you
'Cause I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too

[Bridge]
Moon people going to the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side, I can do anything
When we swing, we hang past right and wrong

[Outro]
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'll do anything for you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with you
Oh, oh, I'm sticking with youYou might also likeEmbed
