Lisa Says Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lisa says that it's alright
When she meets me alone at night
Lisa says that she has her fun
And she'll do it with just about anyone

[Chorus]
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
[Verse 2]
Lisa says that she's on the run
Looking for a special one
Lisa says that every time she makes it straight
She knows her heart will break

[Chorus]
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says

[Bridge]
Looking for a party, some action
Going to make it feel okay
But what do you find
When the time must come undone
Look at it run

[Chorus]
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says

[Chorus]
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
