Louise Lyrics[Chorus]
Louise, take it all back to town
Ain't it a shame you're too old to get around?
But everybody knows you used to dance the hoochy coo
Just can't shake it like you used to do
Louise

[Verse 1]
Louise, you used to work so hard
No one could compare
Always used to build a house
They came from everywhere
Men would scream, the ladies faint
The childrens weren't allowed
No one on another bill could ever draw a crowd
[Pre-Chorus]
That was a long time ago
How you keep it up
I just don't know

[Chorus]
Louise, take it all back to town
Ain't it a shame you're too old to get around?
But everybody knows you used to dance the hoochy coo
Just can't shake it like you used to do
Louise
Louise

[Verse 2]
Younger girls keep coming up, anxious for a chance
They've all been to college, got degrees in modern dance
Things keep getting rougher now
Where they once was slick
Old routines are getting tired
Tassels just don't stick

[Pre-Chorus]
That was a long time ago
How you keep it up
I just don't know
You might also like[Chorus]
Louise, take it all back to town
Ain't it a shame you're too old to get around?
But everybody knows you used to dance the hoochy coo
Just can't shake it like you used to do
Louise
Louise, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh

[Outro]
Louise, ooh
It's so very hard
Every day slips away
Away, away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
