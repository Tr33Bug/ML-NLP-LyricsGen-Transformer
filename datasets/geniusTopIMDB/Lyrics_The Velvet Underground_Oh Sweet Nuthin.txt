Oh! Sweet Nuthinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all
Knocked the shirt right off his back
He ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger Brown
Walks with his head down to the ground
Took the shoes right off his feet
And threw the poor boy right out in the street
And this is what he said
[Chorus]
Oh, sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all

[Verse 2]
Say a word for Polly May
She can't tell the night from the day
They threw her out in the street
Just like a cat, she landed on her feet
And say a word for Joana Love
She ain't got nothing at all
With every day she falls in love
And every night she falls
And when she does she says

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet nothin'
You know she ain't got nothin' at all
Woah-oh, sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, let me hear you

Oh, say a word, say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all, not a thing
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
And not a shirt, shirt on his back
(Oh, sweet nothin')
No, he ain't got nothing at all
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
And say a word for Ginger
(Oh, sweet nothin')
He walks with his head to the ground
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
He took the shoes, took the shoes from his feet, from his feet
(Oh, sweet nothin')
And threw the poor boy out into the street
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
And then he said

[Chorus]
Oh sweet sweet nothin'
She ain't got, she ain't got, she ain't got nothin' at all
Sweet sweet, sweet sweet nothin'
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
She ain't got
Sweet sweet nothin'
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
Sweet sweet nuthin' at all
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
Sweet sweet nothin' got nuthin'
Oh, sweet nuthin'
Oh oh, sweet nothin' at all
(Ain't got nothin' at all)
Oh, let me hear you
[Bridge]
(Oh, sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all
Oh. sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all)
Oh, sweet nothin'
(Oh, sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, sweet nothin'
Ain't got nothin' at all)

[Outro]
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
She ain't got nothin' at all
Sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all
Sweet sweet nothin'
She ain't got nothin' at all6Embed
