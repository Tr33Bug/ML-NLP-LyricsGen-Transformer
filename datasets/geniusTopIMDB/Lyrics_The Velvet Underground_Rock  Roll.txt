Rock & Roll Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jennie said when she was just five years old
There was nothin' happenin' at all
Every time she puts on a radio
There was nothin' goin' down at all
Not at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
You know she don't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine, fine music
You know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
[Pre-Chorus]
Despite all the amputations
You know you could just go out
And dance to the rock 'n' roll station

[Chorus]
It was all right (It was alright)
Hey baby, you know it was alright (It was alright)

[Verse 2]
Jennie said when she was just 'bout five years old
You know my parents gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well you know, it ain't gonna help me at all
Naw, just a tiny bit
Then one fine mornin'
She turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooooh, she started dancin' to that fine, fine music
You know her life is saved by
Rock 'n' roll
Yeah, rock 'n' roll

[Pre-Chorus]
Despite all the computations
You could just dance a to that rock 'n' roll station
You might also like[Chorus]
And baby it was alright (It was alright)
Hey it was alright (It was alright)
Hey here she comes now!
Jump! Jump!

[Verse 3]
And Jennie said when she was just 'bout five years old
Hey, you know, there was nothing happening at all
Not at all, every time I put on the radio
You know there's nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
But one fine mornin' she hears a New York station
She just didn't believe what she heard at all, hey, not at all
She started dancin' to that fine, fine music
You know her life is saved by rock 'n' roll
Yes, rock 'n' roll

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, despite all the computations
You know you could just dance to a rock 'n' roll station

[Outro]
