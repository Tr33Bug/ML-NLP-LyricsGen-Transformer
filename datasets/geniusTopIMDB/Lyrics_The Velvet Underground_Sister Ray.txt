Sister Ray Lyrics[Verse 1]
Duck and Sally inside
They're cooking for the down pipe
Who're staring at Miss Rayon
Who's busy licking up her pig pen
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like Sister Ray said
Whip it on
[Verse 2]
Rosey and Miss Rayon
They're busy waiting for her booster
Who just got back from Carolina
She said she didn't like the weather
They're busy waiting for her sailor
Who says he's just as big as ever
He says he's from Alabama
He wants to know a way to earn a dollar
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like Sister Ray said
Play on

[Verse 3]
Cecil's got his new piece
He cocks and shoots between three and four
He aims it at the sailor
Shoots him down dead on the floor
Oh, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet?
Now don't you know you'll stain the carpet?
And by the way, have you got a dollar?
Oh, no, man, I haven't got the time, time
Too busy sucking on a ding-dong
She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
Oh, she does just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, couldn't, couldn't hit it sideways
Oh it, it just, just all over the floor, the floor

Now, who's that knocking?
Who's that knocking on my chamber door?
Now could it be the police?
They come to take me for a ride, ride
Oh, but I haven't got the time, time
Hey, hey, hey she's busy sucking on my ding-dong
She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
Oh, now, just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like
And, just like
And, just like, yea, Sister Ray said, do it!

[Refrain]
Doc and sally inside, now move it along!
Cooking for the down five
Who's staring at Miss Rayon, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!
Licking up pig pen
I've been s-s-s-s-searching for my mainline
I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Just like
Oh, just like, do it, do it, do it!
Just like
Just like that
Just like
[Verse 5]
Now Rosie and Miss Rayon
They're busy waiting for her booster
She's just back from Carolina
She said she's bound to beat her sailor
I said she hasn't got the time time
Too busy sucking on my ding-dong
Too busy sucking on my ding-dong
Now, just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Whip it on me Jim, whip it on me Jim, whip it on me Jim
Said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, do it
Now just like... just like Sister Ray said

[Verse 6]
I said now Cecil's got his new piece
He cocks it, shoots it bang between three and four
He aims it at the sailor
He shoots him down dead on the floor
Oh, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll hit the carpet?
Don't you know you'll mess the carpet?

[Verse 7]
Oh, she hasn't got the time, time
Busy sucking on his ding-dong
She's busy sucking on his ding-dong
Now just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
Couldn't hit it sideways
Couldn't hit it sideways
Now just like, now just like, now just like
Like Sister Ray said, now do it to him!

[Verse 8]
Duck and Sally move it along, now!
They're cooking for the down pipe
Who're staring at Miss Rayon
Who's busy licking up her pig pen
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like
Now, just like
I said oh, just like
