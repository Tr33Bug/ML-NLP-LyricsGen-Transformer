Stephanie Says Lyrics[Verse 1]
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why she's given half her life to people she hates now
Stephanie says when answering the phone (Stephanie says)
What country shall I say is calling (me) from across the world

[Chorus]
But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind
[Verse 2]
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why it is though she's the door, she can't be the room
Stephanie says but doesn't hang up the phone
What seashell sea is calling (me) from across her world

[Chorus]
But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

[Outro]
They're asking is it good or bad
It's such an icy feeling
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)You might also like3Embed
