Thatâ€™s the Story of My Life Lyrics[Chorus]
That's the story of my life
That's the difference between wrong and right
But Billy said, "Both those words are dead"
That's the story of my life

[Chorus]
That's the story of my life
That's the difference between wrong and right
But Billy said, "Both those words are dead"
That's the story of my life
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ah, that's the story of my life
That's the difference between wrong and right
But Billy said, "Both those words are dead"
