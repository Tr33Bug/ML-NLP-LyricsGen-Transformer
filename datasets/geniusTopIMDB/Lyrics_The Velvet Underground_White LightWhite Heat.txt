White Light/White Heat Lyrics[Verse 1]
(White light) White light goin', messin' up my mind
(White light) And don't you know it's gonna make me go blind
(White heat) Aw, white heat, it tickle me down to my toes
(White light) Ooh, have mercy, while I have it, goodness knows
(White light) White light goin', messin' up my brain
(White light) Aw, white light, it's gonna drive me insane
(White heat) Aw, white heat, it tickle me down to my toes
(White light) Aw, white light, I said now, goodness knows, do it

[Chorus 1]
Hmm, hmm, white light
Aw, I surely do love watching that stuff shoot itself in
Hmm, hmm, white light
Watch that side, watch that side
Don't you know it's gonna be dead in the drive?
Hmm, hmm, white heat
Hey, foxy mama, watchin' her walk down the street
Hmm, hmm, white light
Come upside your head, gonna make a dead end on your street
[Verse 2]
(White light) White light moved in me through my brain
(White light) White light goin', makin' you go insane
(White heat) Aw, white heat, it tickle me down to my toes
(White light) Aw, white light, I said now, goodness knows
(White light) Aw, white light, it lighten up my eyes
(White light) Don't you know it fills me up with surprise?
(White heat) Aw, white heat, tickle me down to my toes
(White light) Aw, white light, I tell you now, goodness knows, now work it

[Chorus 2]
