1921 LyricsGot a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
So you think '21
Is going to be a good year?
It could be good for me and her
But you and her, no, never!
I had no reason to be over-optimistic
But somehow, when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!
You didn't hear it
(I heard it)
You didn't see it
(I saw it)
You won't say nothing to no one
(I won't say nothing to no one)
Never in your life
(Never in my life)
You never heard it
(I heard it)
How absurd it all seems
Without any proof
(How absurd it all seems without any proof)
You didn't hear it
(I heard it)
You didn't see it
(I saw it)
You never heard it, not a word of it!
(I heard it, every word of it)
You won't say nothing to no one
(I won't say nothing to no one)
Never tell a soul
What you know is the truth
(Never tell a soul
What I know is the truth)
