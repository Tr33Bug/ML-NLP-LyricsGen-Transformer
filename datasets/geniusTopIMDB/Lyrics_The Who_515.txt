5:15 Lyrics
Why should I care?
Why should I care?

Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing
Eau de Cologning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women
Magically bored on a quiet street corner
Free frustration in our minds and our toes
Quiet storm water, m-m-my generation
Uppers and downers, either way blood flows

(Inside outside) Leave me alone
(Inside outside) Nowhere is home
(Inside outside) Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train

On a raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
Back of a lorry
Holy hitching
Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in the war
Birthday punching
He man drag in a glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous in my high heel shoes
Tightly undone, know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic that their heros are news
You might also like
(Inside outside) Leave me alone
(Inside outside) Nowhere is home
(Inside outside) Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train

Why should I care?
Why should I care?1Embed
