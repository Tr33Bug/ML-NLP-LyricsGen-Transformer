A Quick One, While He’s Away Lyrics
Her man's been gone for nearly a year
He was due home yesterday, but he ain't here
Her man's been gone for nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday, but he ain't here

Down your street, your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well known throughout your town
Your town is very famous for the little girl
Whose crying can be heard all around the world
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la
We have a remedy you'll appreciate
No need to be so sad, he's only late
We'll bring you flowers and things, help pass your time
We'll give him eagle's wings, then he can fly to you
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la la
We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la
We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la
We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la
We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la

Little girl, why don't you stop your crying?
I'm gonna make you feel alright

My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver
I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through
He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
Please take a sweet (take a sweet)
Come take a walk with me (walk with me)
We’ll sort it out (sort it out)
Back at my place, maybe (back at my place, maybe)
It’ll come right
You ain’t no fool, I ain’t either
So why not be nice to an old engine driver?
Better be nice to an old engine driver
Better be nice to an old engine driver
We'll soon be home
We'll soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home
We'll soon be home
We'll soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home
Come on, old horse

Soon be home
Soon be home
Soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home
We'll soon be home
Soon be

Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang
(Cello cello cello cello cello cello cello cello
Cello cello cello cello cello cello cello cello
Cello cello cello cello cello cello cello cello)
I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again
I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap
You are forgiven, you are forgiven
You are forgiven (you are forgiven)
You are forgiven (you are forgiven)
You are forgiven (you are forgiven)
You are forgiven (you are forgiven)
You are forgiven (you are forgiven)
Forgiven


You are forgiven3Embed
