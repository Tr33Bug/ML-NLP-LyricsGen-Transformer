Bell Boy Lyrics
The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Hazy days
Crazy days

Aren't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
I've got a good job and I'm newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel all gilt and flash
Remember the gaff where the doors were smashed?

Bell Boy!
I got to get running now
Bell Boy!
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy!
Carry this baggage out
Bell Boy!
Always running at someone's bleeding heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel

Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
Then I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks

The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Crazy days, crazy days
Crazy days, crazy days
You might also like
Aren't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63

People often change
But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot
From a life like mine
The secret to me
It ain't flown like a flag
I carry it behind this bleeding little badge
What says

Bell Boy!
I got to get running now
Bell Boy!
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy!
Carry the bloody baggage out
Bell Boy!
Always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heelEmbed
