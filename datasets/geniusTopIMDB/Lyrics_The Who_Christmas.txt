Christmas Lyrics
Did you ever see the faces of the children? They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean including heaven's generosity
Peeping round the door to see what parcels are for free in curiosity

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?
Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently and unaware of anything
Playing poxy pinball picks his nose and smiles and pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love but how can men who've never seen light be enlightened?
Only if he's cured will his spirit's future level ever heighten

And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
How can he be saved?

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me!

Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Tommy can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
How can he be saved?
