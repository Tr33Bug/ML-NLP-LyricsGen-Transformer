Cut My Hair Lyrics
Why should I care
If I have to cut my hair?
I got to move with the fashion
Or be outcast
I know I should fight
But my old man he's really alright
And I'm still living at home
Even though it won't last

Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt them
Mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll
Let me stay

Zoot suit, white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain

Why do I have to be different to them
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend
Have the same old row again and again
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around
I work myself to death just to fit in
You might also likeI'm coming down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work
He wasn't talking
It's all a game
And inside I'm just the same
My fried egg makes me sick
First thing in the morningEmbed
