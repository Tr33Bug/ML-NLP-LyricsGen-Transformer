Doctor Jimmy Lyrics
Laugh and say I'm green
I've seen things you've never seen
Talk behind my back
I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink till I drop down
With one eye on my clothes

What is it?
I'll take it
Who is she?
I'll rape it
Got a bet there?
I'll meet it
Getting high
You can't beat it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

You say she's a virgin
But I'm gonna be the first in
Her fella's going to kill me?
Oh, fucking will he
I'm seeing d-double
Don't miss me if you can
There's gonna be trouble
When she chooses her man

What is it?
I'll take it
Who is she?
I'll rape it
Got a bet there?
I'll meet it
Getting high
You can't beat it

Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling

I'm going back soon
Home to get that baboon
Who cut up my eye
Tore up my Levis
I'm feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down
What is it?
I'll take it
Who is she?
I'll rape it
Got a bet there?
I'll meet it
Getting high
You can't beat it
What is it?
I'll take it
Who is she?
Ooh, I'll rape it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin

Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is callingEmbed
