Eyesight to the Blind (The Hawker) LyricsYou talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Yeah, you talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she starts to shakin'
The dumb begin to talk
{Instrumental Bridge}
She's got the power to heal you
Never fear
She's got the power to heal you
Never fear
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hearYou might also like1Embed
