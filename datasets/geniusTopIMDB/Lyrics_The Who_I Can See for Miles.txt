I Can See for Miles Lyrics

I know you've deceived me
Now here's a surprise
I know that you have
'Cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
If you think that I don't know about
The little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately
You put things in my way

Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

You took advantage of my trust in you
When I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys
And now you've got the nerve to say

That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while
You might also like
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

I know you've deceived me
Now here's a surprise
I know that you have
'Cause there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal
Are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball
To see right through the haze
Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and
Miles and miles and miles and
Miles and miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles...9Embed
