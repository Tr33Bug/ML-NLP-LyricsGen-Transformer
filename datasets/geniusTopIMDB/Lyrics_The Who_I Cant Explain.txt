I Canâ€™t Explain Lyrics

Got a feeling inside (Can't explain)
It's a certain kind (Can't explain)
I feel hot and cold (Can't explain)
Yeah, down in my soul, yeah (Can't explain)
I said (Can't explain)
I'm feeling good now, yeah, but (Can't explain)

Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling blue
The things you've said, well, maybe they're true
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means, but
Can't explain, I think it's love
Try to say it to you when I feel blue
But I can't explain (Can't explain)
Yeah, hear what I'm sayin', girl (Can't explain)


Dizzy in the head and I'm feeling bad
The things you've said have got me real mad
I'm gettin' funny dreams again and again
I know what it means but

Can't explain, I think it's love
Try to say it to you when I feel blue
But I can't explain (Can't explain)
But give me more try now, yeah (Can't explain)


I said I can't explain, yeah (Can't explain)
You drive me out of my mind (Can't explain)
Yeah, I'm the worrying kind, babe (Can't explain)
