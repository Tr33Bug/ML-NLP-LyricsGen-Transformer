Iâ€™m One Lyrics
Every year is the same
And I feel it again
I'm a loser
No chance to win
Leaves start falling
Come down is calling
Loneliness starts sinking in

But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
Where do you get
Those blue blue jeans
Faded, patched secret, so tight
Where do you get
That walk, oh so lean
Your shoes and your shirts
All just right

But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One

I got a Gibson
Without a case
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face
Ill fitting clothes
And I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud

But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
You might also like
I'm the OneEmbed
