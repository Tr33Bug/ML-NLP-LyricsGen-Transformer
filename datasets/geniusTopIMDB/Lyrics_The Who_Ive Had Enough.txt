Iâ€™ve Had Enough Lyrics
You were under the impression
That when you were walking forwards
That you'd end up further onward
But things ain't quite that simple
You got altered information
You were told to not take chances
You missed out on new dances
Now you're losing all your dimples

My jacket's going to be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet
Love rain on me
Rain on me
Love rain on me
Love
 
I've had enough of living
I've had enough of dying
I've had enough of smiling
I've had enough of crying
I've taken all the high roads
I've squandered and I've saved
I've had enough of childhood
I've had enough of graves

Get a job and fight to keep it
Strike out to reach a mountain
Be so nice on the outside
But inside keep ambition
Don't cry because you hunt them
Hurt them first, they'll love you
There's a millionaire above you
And you're under his suspicion
You might also like
My jacket's going to be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
Wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet
Love rain on me
Rain on me
Love rain on me
Love

Had enough of dancehalls
I've had enough of pills
I've had enough of streetfights
I've seen my share of kills
I'm finished with the fashions
And acting like I'm tough
I'm bored with hate and passion
I've had enough of trying to love2Embed
