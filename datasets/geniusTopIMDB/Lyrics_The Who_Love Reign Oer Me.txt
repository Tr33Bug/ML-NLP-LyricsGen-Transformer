Love Reign Oâ€™er Me Lyrics

Only love can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields

Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me
Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high

Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me, rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me, rain o'er me

On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone
I need to get back home to cool cool rain
I can't sleep and I lay and I think
The night is hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink of cool cool rain


Love reign o'er me
Rain over me, over me, over me
Oh, love reign o'er me
O'er me
