My Wife Lyrics
My life's in jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be
I ain't been home since Friday night
And now my wife is coming after me
Give me police protection
I'm gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard, a black belt Judo expert
With a machine gun

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me, won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots
And take a long, long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive
All I did was have a bit too much to drink
And I picked the wrong precinct
Got picked up by the law
And now I ain't got time to think

Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me, won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car, put on my lead boots
And take a long, long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive

And I'm oh-so tired of running
Gonna lay down on the floor
I've gotta rest some time
So I can get to run some more, yeah

She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'You might also like2Embed
