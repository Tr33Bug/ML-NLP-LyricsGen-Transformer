Pinball Wizard Lyrics
Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers, always playin' clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin', plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinballYou might also like8Embed
