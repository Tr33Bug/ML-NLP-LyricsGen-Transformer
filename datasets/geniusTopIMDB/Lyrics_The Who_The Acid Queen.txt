The Acid Queen LyricsIf your child ain't all he should be now
This girl could put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy, I guarantee
To tear your soul apart
Give us a room, close the door
Leave us for a while
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young, but not a child
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay before we start
The gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the gypsy queen must do
You're gonna hit the road
My work is done
Now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head, it shakes
His fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the gypsy, I'm guaranteed
To break your little heart
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
I'm the gypsy, the acid queen
Pay before we start
The gypsy, I'm guaranteed
