The Kids Are Alright Lyrics
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well

But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away

And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright

I know if I go, things would be a lot better for her
I had things planned, but her folks wouldn't let her

I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well

But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
You might also like

Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away

And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright3Embed
