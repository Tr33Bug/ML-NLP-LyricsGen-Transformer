The Punk and the Godfather Lyrics
You declared you would be three inches taller
You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you

I'm the guy in the sky
Flying high, flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
I'm the punk in the gutter
I'm the new president
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know
Don't it show
I'm the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation
We tried to speak between lines of oration
You could only repeat what we told you
Your axe belongs to a dying nation
They don't know that we own you
You're watching movies trying to find the feelers
You only see what we show you
We're the slaves of the phony leaders
Breathe the air we have blown you

I'm the guy in the sky
Flying high, flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
I'm the punk in the gutter
I'm the new president
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know
Don't it show
I'm the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation

I have to be careful not to preach
I can't pretend that I can teach
And yet I lived your future out
By pounding stages like a clown
And on the dance floor broken glass
And bloody faces slowly pass
The numbered seats in empty rows
It all belongs to me you know
You might also like
You declared you would be three inches taller
You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you

I'm the guy in the sky
Flying high, flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
I'm the punk in the gutter
I'm the new president
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know
Don't it show
I'm the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
