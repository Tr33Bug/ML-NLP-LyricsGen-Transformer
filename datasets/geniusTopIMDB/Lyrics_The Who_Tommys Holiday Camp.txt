Tommyâ€™s Holiday Camp Lyrics
Good morning Campers!
I'm your Uncle Ernie
And I'll welcome you to Tommy's Holiday Camp
The camp with the difference
Never mind the weather
When you come to Tommy's
The holiday's forever
The camp with the difference
Never mind the weather
When you come to Tommy's
The holiday's forever, ha ha!
