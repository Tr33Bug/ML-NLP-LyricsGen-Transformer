1984 Lyrics1984
Someday they won't let you
Now you must agree
The times they are a telling
And the changing isn't free
You read it in the tea leaves
And the tracks are on TV
Beware the Savage Jaw
In 1984
They'll split your bleeding cranium
And fill it full of air
They'll tell you that you're eighty
And really you won't care
You'll be shooting up on everything
Tomorrow's never there
Beware the Savage Jaw
In 1984
Come see, come see
Remember me
I played in an all night movie role
Yeah, you thought it would last
But I guess we've enrolled
In 1984
Who could ask for more
1984
Who could ask for more
I'm looking for a vehicle
I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party
I'm looking for a sign
I'm looking for the treason
That I knew in Sixty Five
Beware the Savage Jaw
In 1984
Come see, come see
Remember me
I played in an all night movie role
You said it would last
But I guess we've enrolled
In 1984
Who could ask for more
1984
Who could ask for more
