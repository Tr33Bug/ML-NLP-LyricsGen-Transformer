A Fool in Love Lyrics
Oh, there's something on my mind
Won't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong?

You're just a fool, you know you're in love
You've got to face it to let it explode
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad
(One more time)
You know you love him, you can't understand (Tell me 'bout it)
Why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man?
And listen, he's got me smiling when I should be ashamed
Got me laughin' when my heart is in pain
Oh no, I must be a fool
'Cause I'll do anything he wants me to, now how come?

You're just a fool, you know you're in love (Tell me one more time)
You've got to face it to let it explode (Hey)
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad (One more time)
You know you love him, you can't understand
Why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man?

And listen, without the man, I don't wanna live
You think I'm lyin' but I'm telling you like it is
He's got my nose open and that's no lie
And I, I'm gonna keep him satisfied

You're just a fool, you know you're in love (Tell me one more time)
You've got to face it to let it explode (Oh how come?)
You take the good along with the bad (Tell me how come)
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad (One more time)
You know you love him you can't understand (Tell me 'bout it)
Why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man?
You might also like
And listen, ways of action speaks louder than words
The truest sound that I ever heard
I trust the man and all that he do
And I, and I'll do anything he wants me to, now how come?

'Cause just a fool, you know you're in love (Tell me one more time)
You've got to face it to let it explode (Hey)
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad (Tell me one more time)
You know you love him, you can't understand (Tell me 'bout it)
Why he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man?
(Tell me) Du du du du
(Tell me one more time) Du du du du
(Hey) Du du du du
(Tell me one more time) Du du du du
Du du du du
Du du duEmbed
