Addicted To Love Lyrics
The lights are on but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your body sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't eat you can't sleep
There's no doubt you're in deep
Your throat is tight you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Oh you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love
You see the signs but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats at double time
Another kiss and you'll be mind one track mind
You can't be saved another young love is all you crave
And if the sun left you you don't mind it feels blue

Oh you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love
Gonna have to face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it you're addicted to love

Your lights are on but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your body sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't eat you can't sleep
There's no doubt you're in deep
Your throat is tight you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need
You might also like
Oh you like to think that you're immune
To the stuff oh yeah
It's closer to the truth
You know you're gonna have to face it
You might as well face it
You're addicted to love
You might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face itEmbed
