Ask Me How I Feel Lyrics
Oh, waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel?
When things are going wrong
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feel?
You're much too loose to hold
Why don't you ask me how I feel?

I close my eyes
To follow you
To my surprise
You're so untrue
And I'm crying
I'm dying

Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel
And when you keep me hanging on
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
The waters run so deep
Ask me how I feel
When I don't get any sleep
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
And when you're down
You lean on me
You're a fool
Too blind to see


Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
Oh what the hell is going on?
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
When you stay out late at night
Oh ask me how I feel
When you think that I'm uptight
Why don't you ask me how I feel?
You might also like
You don't treat me tender
No matter what I do
But I'm the great pretender
Woah ho ho ho





Oh I'm waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel
When things are going wrong
Come on an' ask me how I feel
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feelEmbed
