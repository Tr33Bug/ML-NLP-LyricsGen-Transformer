Disco Inferno Lyrics(Burn, baby, burn, baby, burn)
(Burn, baby, burn, baby, burn)
(Burn, baby, burn, baby, burn)
(Burn, baby, burn, baby, burn)
(Burn, baby, burn, burn)
(Burn, baby, burn, burn)

(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down
(Burning)
To my surprise one hundred stories high
People getting loose now, getting down on the roof
Folks screaming, out of control
It was so entertaining when the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down
(Burning)

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down

Up above my head
I hear music in the air
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere
(Just can't stop) When my spark gets hot
(Just can't stop) When my spark gets hotEmbed
