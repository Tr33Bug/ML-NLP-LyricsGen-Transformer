GoldenEye Lyrics
See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface in every shadow
On the wind I feel his breath
Golden eye I found his weakness
Golden eye he'll do what I please
Golden eye no time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees

You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know
How it feels to be the one who's left behind
You'll never know the days, the nights
The tears, the tears I've cried
But now my time has come
And time, time is not on your side
See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls, they gather around him
If I had him I wouldn't let him out
Golden eye not lace or leather
Golden chain take him to the spot
Golden eye I'll show him forever
It'll take forever to see
What I've got

You'll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You'll never know
How it feels to get so close
And be denied
It's a gold and honey trap
I've got for you tonight
Revenge, it's a kiss, this time I won't miss
Now I've got you in my sight
With a Golden eye

Golden, golden eye
With a golden eye
Golden eye, golden eye
Golden eye, golden eyeYou might also like2Embed
