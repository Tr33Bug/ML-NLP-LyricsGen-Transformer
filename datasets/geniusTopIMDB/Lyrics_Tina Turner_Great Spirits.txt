Great Spirits Lyrics
When the Earth was young
And the air was sweet
And the mountains kissed the sky
In the great beyond with its many paths
Man and nature lived side by side
In this wilderness of danger and beauty
Lived three brothers bonded by love
Their hearts full of joy
They ask now for guidance
Reaching out to the skies up above
Great spirits of all who lived before
Take our hands and lead us
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same

Give us wisdom to pass to each other
And give us strength so we understand
That the things we do
The choices we make
Give direction to all life's plans
To look and wonder at all we've been given
In our world that's not always as it seems
Every corner we turn only leads to another
A journey ends but another begins

Ooo, great spirits of all who lived before
(Take our hands)
Take our hands and lead us
(Fill our hearts)
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
(You know you can show)
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same
You might also likeOoo, great spirits of all who lived before
(Take our hands)
Take our hands and lead us
(Fill our hearts)
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know
(You know you can show)
Show us that in your eyes
We are all the same
Brothers to each other
In this world we remain
Truly brothers all the same
Brothers all the same!Embed
