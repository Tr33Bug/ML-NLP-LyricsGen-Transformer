I Canâ€™t Stand the Rain Lyrics
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because he's not here with me

Hey, window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be?
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because here's not here with me
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand
I can't stand the rain, can't stand the rain

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because here's not here with me
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand
You might also like
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
It just keeps on holding me
Get off of my window
Because here's not here with me
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memoriesEmbed
