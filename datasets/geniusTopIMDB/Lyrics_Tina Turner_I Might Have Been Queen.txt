I Might Have Been Queen Lyrics
I'm a new pair of eyes every time I am born
And original mind because I just died
And I'm scanning the horizon
For someone recognizing that I might have been queen
For every sun that sets there is a new one dawning
For every empire crushed there is a brand new nation
Let the waters rise
I have ridden each tide
From the gates of the city
Where the first born died
And I might have been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the rivers won't stop for me
No, the rivers won't stop for me

I'm a new pair of eyes and original mind
With my senses of old and the heart of a giant
And I'm searching through the wreckage
For some recollection that I might have been queen
For every sage that falls there's an ancient child

And I might have been queen
I remember the girl in the fields with no name
She had a love
Oh, but the rivers won't stop for me
No, the rivers won't stop for me

I look up to the stars with my perfect memory
I look through it all and my future is no shock to me
I look down but I see no tragedy
I look up to my past, a spirit running free
I look down, I look down and I'm there in history
Ho, I'm a soul survivor
You might also like
A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queen
But it won't stop
A soul survivor on the river
I might have been queenEmbed
