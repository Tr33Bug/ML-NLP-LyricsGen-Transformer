I Wrote a Letter LyricsI wrote a letter to my love today
I wrote it so hard on what I gotta say
I`m down and out to tell you the truth
A man can make the poor girl sing the blues
You know what I couldn`t be with you
When there`s a chance please give me a clue
Untill I drown in a sea of booze
A man can make the woman sing the blues,yeah
Took my pride and I threw it away
You gotta release me from this suffering
You`ll find me everywhere running around
Untill you showed up to find me in the gutter
I wrote a letter to my love today
I wrote it so hard on what I gotta say
All my life is ending up the blues
A man can make the poor girl sing the blues
Yeah you can make the white girl sing the blues
Took my pride and I threw it away
You gotta release me from this suffering
You`ll find me everywhere running around
Untill you showed up to find me in the gutter
I wrote a letter to my love today
I wrote it so hard on what I gotta say
I`m down and out to tell you the truth
All my life is ending up blues
When there`s a chance please give me a clue
Cause you know what I couldn`t be with you
Untill I drown in a sea of booze
A man can make the woman sing the blues
A man cam make the white girl sing the blues
Yeah,yeah,yeah,oh yeah
You got me singing the blues
You got me singing the blues
