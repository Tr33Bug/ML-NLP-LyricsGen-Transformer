In Your Wildest Dreams Lyrics
Oh baby, oh baby
The sun goes down and the moon comes up
My heart is pumping for you, and the mad thing starts yeah

Ohho..yeah, never in your wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams, oh no
Never in your wildest dreams could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams, oh no
Oh baby, oh baby
The night is hot outside your window
I hear people walking, people talking
I smell your skin, I feel you breathing
Don't let me go, not yet, not yet, not yet


Oh baby, oh baby
The world is slowly turning
As it turns I see your face, touch your eyes, your lips, space space
We've arrived at the place where they open the hearts
And fill them up with love, filled with love, filled with love
This one's pumping for you, as the mad thing starts


[text in (..) translated: sung by Antonio Banderas in Spanish
(We've arrived at the place where they open the hearts
And fill them up with love, filled with love, filled with love
This one's pumping for you
