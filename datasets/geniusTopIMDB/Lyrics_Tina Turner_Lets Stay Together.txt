Letâ€™s Stay Together Lyrics
Let me say
Since, since we've been together
Uh, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
It's alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my whole life with you
Let me say
Since, since we've been together
Uh, loving you forever is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
(Good or bad, happy or sad)

Why, oh, tell me, why do people break up
And turn around and make up?
I just came to see
You'd never do that to me, would you, baby?
Being around you is all I see
You might also like
So, baby, let's we all stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Let's (let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
(Let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether
Whether (times are good or bad, happy or sad)
Oh, baby, let's
Let's
Loving you whether
Whether (times are good or bad, happy or sad)Embed
