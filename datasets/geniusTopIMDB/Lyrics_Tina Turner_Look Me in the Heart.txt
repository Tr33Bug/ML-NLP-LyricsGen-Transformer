Look Me in the Heart Lyrics
Last night we tried to touch
But we never got close
Last night we tried to talk
The words got caught in our throats
When we finally fell asleep
We couldn't have been further apart

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me in the heart
You try to say that I'm hiding from you
You act like a spy, always looking for clues
You've read about my past
But why don't we try to make a new start?

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me in the heart

I remember how good we used to be together
I can remember, baby
So be tender, baby
Remember the love
We said would last forever
I know we can make it like that again

Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me, look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby, look me in the heart
And you'll see that I'm so crazy about you, baby
And it's not in my mind
Can't you look me in the heart?
Look me in the heart
Look me in my heart, in my heart, in my heartYou might also like1Embed
