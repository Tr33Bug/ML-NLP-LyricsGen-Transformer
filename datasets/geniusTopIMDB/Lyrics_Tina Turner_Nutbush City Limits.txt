Nutbush City Limits Lyrics
A church house, gin house
School house, outhouse
On highway number nineteen
The people keep the city clean

They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
They call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city
Twenty-five was the speed limit
Motorcycle not allowed in it
You go to store on Fridays
You go to church on Sundays

They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
Said they call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city

You go to field on the weekdays
And have a picnic on Labor Day
You go to town on Saturdays
And go to church on Sundays

They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
They call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city

No whiskey for sale
You get drunk, no bail
Salt pork and molasses
Is all you get in jail
You might also like
They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
I said they call it Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city

A little old town in Tennessee
Quiet little old community
One-horse town
You got to watch what they're putting down

Oh, Nutbush
They call it Nutbush
They call it Nutbush
Oh, Nutbush
Oh
Oh
They call it Nutbush, yeah
They call it Nutbush
