One of the Living LyricsIn the desert sun ev'ry step that you take could be the final one
And in the burning heat
Hanging on the edge of destruction
No
You can't stop the pain of your children crying out in your head
They always said that the living would envy the dead
So now you're gonna shoot
Shoot bullets of fire
Don't wanna fight
But sometimes you've got to
You're some soul survivor
And there's just one thing you've got to know:
You've got ten more thousand miles to go because you're
One of the living - and if you can't stick together
Well
You're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight ?
Walk tall
Cool
Collected
But savage
Walk tall
Bruised
Sensual
Ravaged
It's ev'ry man for himself
Ev'ry woman
Ev'ry child
A new breed
Ferocious and wild
And all they wanna do is shoot bullets of fire
They wanna fight
But sometimes you've got to
You're some soul survivor
And there's just one thing you've got to know:
You've got ten more thousand miles to go because you're
One of the living - and if you can't stick together
Well
You're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight ?
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
Well
You're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight ?
Shoot bullets of fire
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
...
You're one of the living - and if we can't stick together
