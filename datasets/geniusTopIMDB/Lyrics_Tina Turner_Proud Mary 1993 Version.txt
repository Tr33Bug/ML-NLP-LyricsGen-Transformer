Proud Mary (1993 Version) LyricsYou know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
But there's just one thing, you see
We never ever do nothing
Nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
But we're gonna take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
But then we're gonna do the finish rough
The way we do Proud Mary
(Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river)
Listen to the story
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
I weren't worryin' 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Ooh, the Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin' (rolling), rollin', yeah (rolling)
Rollin' on the river (rolling on the river)
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
(And I) Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
(You know that) Big wheel keep on turnin'
Ooh, the Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin' (rolling), rollin', yeah (rolling)
Rollin' on the river (rolling on the river)
I said we're rollin' (rolling), rollin' (rolling)
Rollin' on the river (rolling on the river)
Oh I left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Rollin' on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis, y'all
Pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
