The Best - Edit Lyrics(Verse 1 : )
I call you
When I need you
My heart's on fire
You come to me
Come to me
Wild and wired
Oh, you come to me
Give me everything I need
You bring a lifetime of promises
And a world of dreams
You speak the language of love
Like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong
(Chorus : )
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart baby
Baby, I would rather be dead
(Verse 2 : )
In your heart I see
The start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost
I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place
(Chorus : )
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead
You might also like(Bridge : )
Each time you leave me
I start losing control
You're walking away
With my heart and my soul
I can feel it even when I'm alone
Oh baby, don't let go
(Chorus :)
You're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart, no, no
Baby, I would rather be dead
(Outro :)
You're the bestEmbed
