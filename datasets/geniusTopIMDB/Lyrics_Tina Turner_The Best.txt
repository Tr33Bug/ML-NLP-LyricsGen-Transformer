The Best Lyrics
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me, wild and wired
Ooh, you come to me, give me everything I need

Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
Mm, and it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, baby
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart? No, no
Baby, I would rather be dead
You might also like
Each time you leave me, I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh, baby, don't let go

Oh, you're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart? No, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

You're the best

Oh, you're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart, baby
I hang on every word you say
Oh, tear us apart? No, no
Baby, I would rather be dead
Oh, you're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Oh, you're the best1Embed
