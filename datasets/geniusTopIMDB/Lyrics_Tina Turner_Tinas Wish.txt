Tinaâ€™s Wish LyricsI'm talking to the priest
The high priest
And everybody out there in the universe
If what I'm saying is wrong
Then tell me the right way to say it
Cause I wanna be made over
Paint me red, paint me green
Give me liberty, wash me clean
Make me over, make me nice
Cause when I'm done, Lord, I wanna be right
Hey Lord
Make me over, I wanna be made over
Hey Lord
Make me over, I wanna be made over
Make me smart, make me king
Give a lot, give me steam
I want eternal beauty, spiritual things
Cause when I'm done, yes I wanna be a good thing
Hey Lord
Make me over, I wanna be made over
Hey Lord
Make me over, I wanna be made over
I wanna go places, I wanna do some things
I wanna be a star, I wanna have a big name
But in my heart, let beauty reign
And when I'm done, I wanna have fame
Lord make me nice, Lord make me good
Give me power, give me love
I wanna be desireable, voluptous, tenderlizedYou might also likeEmbed
