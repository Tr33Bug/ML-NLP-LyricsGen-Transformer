Tonight Lyrics
We're gonna do this one together tonight
Everything's gonna be alright tonight
C'mon
Oh, wonderful

Everything's gonna be alright tonight
No one moves
No one grooves
No one talks
No one talks tonight, tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one talks tonight, tonight

I will love you 'til I reach the end
I will love you 'til I reach the end
I will love you 'til I die
I will see you in the sky tonight
Tonight

Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one talks tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
