Way Of The World Lyrics
Baby i need a hand to hold tonight
And one bright star to remind me
How dear is this life
Baby i've never known anyone like you
There's something very special about you
I can't imagine living without you

It's the way of the world and it's motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tight
You capture the beat of my heart
In my heart there's a fire that's burning
And there isn't a thing i can do
I'm resigned to the fact
That there's no turning back
And i'll never regret loving you
Baby i will go anywhere you lead
As long as you're there beside me
Baby that's all i need
Hold me hold me and never let me go
I'm always gonna care about you
I never want to be without you


You're everything i believe in
Don't ever lose the feeling
Don't ever lose the feeling no

It's the way of the world and it's motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And you're holding me tightYou might also likeEmbed
