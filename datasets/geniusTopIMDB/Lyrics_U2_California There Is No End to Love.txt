California (There Is No End to Love) Lyrics
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
Bar-Bar-Barbara, Santa Barbara
California, then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well, that's what took me where I need to be
Which is here, out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California, at the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does

Oh, all I know
And all I need to know
Is there is no, yeah, there is no end to love

I didn't call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone's a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom, in a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California, blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself
There's no end to grief
That's how I know
You might also like
Whoa, that's how I know
And why I need to know
That there is no, yeah, there is no end to love
Whoa, all I know and all I need to know
Is there is no, yeah, there is no end to love


Oh, all I know
And all I need to know is there is no, yeah there is no end to love
Whoa, we come and go
Stolen days you don't give back
Stolen days are just enough28Embed
