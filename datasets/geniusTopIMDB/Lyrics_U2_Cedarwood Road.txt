Cedarwood Road Lyrics
I was running down the road
The fear was all I knew
I was looking for a soul that’s real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship, once it’s won
It’s won... it’s won

Northside just across the river to the Southside
That’s a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road
Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
‘Cause it’s never dead, it’s still my head
It was a warzone in my teens
I’m still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can’t see
You can... you can

Northside just across the river from the Southside
That’s a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road

If the door is open it isn’t theft
You can’t return to where you’ve never left
Blossoms falling from a tree, they cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, Bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
Sometimes fear is the only place that we can call our home
Cedarwood Road

And a heart that is broken
Is a heart that is open, open, open20Embed
