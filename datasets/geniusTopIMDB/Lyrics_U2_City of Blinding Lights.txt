City of Blinding Lights Lyrics
The more you see, the less you know
The less you find out as you go
I knew much more then than I do now
Neon heart, dayglo eyes, a city lit by fireflies
They're advertising in the skies for people like us

And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

Don't look before you laugh
Look ugly in a photograph
Flash bulbs, purple irises the camera can't see
I've seen you walk unafraid
I've seen you in the clothes you made
Can you see the beauty inside of me?
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?

And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

Time, time, time, time
Time won't leave me as I am
But time won't take the boy out of this man
You might also like
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
Oh, you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights

The more you know, the less you feel
Some pray for, others steal
Blessings are not just for the ones who kneel
