Iris (Hold Me Close) Lyrics
The star
That gives us light
Has been gone a while
But it's not an illusion
The ache
In my heart
Is so much a part
Of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years
Hold me close
Hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close
Like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close
The darkness just lets us see
Who we are
Iâ€™ve got your light inside of me
Iris
Iris

Once we are born, we begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
I'm sure I've met
Long before the night the stars went out
We're meeting up again

Hold me close
Hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close
Like I'm someone that you might know
You might also likeHold me close
The darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I've got your light inside of me
Iris
Iris

The stars are bright, but do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold
You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Don't fear the world it isn't there
Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me
Iris
Iris
She says
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see yourself
Free yourself to be yourself
If only you could see35Embed
