Love Is All We Have Left LyricsNothing to stop this being the best day ever
Nothing to keep us from where we should be
I wanted the world but you knew better
And that all we have is immortality
There is a light
Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left
Love and love is all we have left
You argue because you can’t accept
Love is all we have left
Now you’re at the other end of a telescope
Seven billion stars in her eyes
So many stars
So many ways of seeing
Hey this is no time not to be alive
Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left
Love and love is all we have left
The only thing that can be kept
Love is all we have leftYou might also likeEmbed
