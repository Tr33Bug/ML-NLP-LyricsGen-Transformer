Miss Sarajevo LyricsIs there a time for keeping your distance
A time to turn your eyes away
Is there a time for keeping your head down
For getting on with your day
Is there a time for kohl and lipstick
Is there time for cutting hair
Is there a time for high street shopping
To find the right dress to wear
Here she comes, heads turn around
Here she comes, to take her crown
Is there a time to run for cover
A time for kiss and tell
A time for different colours
Different names you find hard to spell
Is there a time for first communion
A time for East 17
Is there time to turn to Mecca
Is there time to be a beauty queen
Here she comes, beauty plays the clown
Here she comes, surreal in her crown
Dici che il fiume
Trova la via al mare
E come il fiume
Giungerai a me
Oltre i confini
E le terre assetate
Dici che come il fiume
Come il fiume...
L'amore giungerà
L'amore...
E non so più pregare
E nell'amore non so più sperare
E quell'amore non so più aspettare

A time for Christmas trees
Is there a time for laying tables
When the night is set to freeze6Embed
