Song for Someone Lyrics
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
And this is a song, a song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there, it's yours to take

I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out

This is a song, this is a song for someone

And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out44Embed
