Summer of Love Lyrics
The winter
Doesn't want you
It haunts you
Summer serenadings
A long way
From this frozen place
Your face
Our teacher
Our preacher
It's nature
And like flowers growing in a bomb crater
From nothing
A rose
It grows
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

We're freezing
We're leaving
Believing
That all we need is to head over somewhere
In a summer
To come
So we run

I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

Oh and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh the same oceans crossed
For some it’s pleasure, for some it’s pain
You might also like
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
In the rubble of Aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love
A summer of love5Embed
