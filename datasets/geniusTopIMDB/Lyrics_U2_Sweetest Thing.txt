Sweetest Thing Lyrics
Hyyyyyyyyy hyyy hyyy
Hmmmmmmmm mmm mmm

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
But she won't catch me or break my fall
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she wants a dry kind of love
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
I'm losin' you, I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run, but she made me crawl
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
(Oh oh, the sweetest thing)
I know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
I guess it's a blind kind of love
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)

I'm losin' you, whoa oh hyyyy
I'm losin' you
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
(Ain't love the sweetest thing?)
(Ain't love the sweetest thing?)
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
Aaaaahhhhh 

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a rain-cloud
Ours is a stormy kind of love
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)

(Doo doo doo doo) the sweetest thing

Ohohoh, the sweetest thing4Embed
