The Blackout Lyrics
A dinosaur, wonders why it still walks the earth, yeah
A meteor, promises it's not gonna hurt, yeah
Earthquake, always happen when you're in bed, Fred
The house shakes, maybe was it something I said, Ned
Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother

When the lights go out, throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, donâ€™t you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
Statues fall, democracy is flat on its back, Jack
We had it all, and what we had is not coming back, Zach
A big mouth says the people, they don't wanna be free for free
The blackout, is this an extinction event we see?
Go, easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go, easy on me, easy on me, now

When the lights go out, throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Blackout, it's clear, who you are will appear
Blackout, no fear, so glad that we are all still here
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
You might also like
When the lights go out, throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out, don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out3Embed
