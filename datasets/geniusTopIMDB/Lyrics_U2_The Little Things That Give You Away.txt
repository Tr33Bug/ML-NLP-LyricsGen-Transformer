The Little Things That Give You Away Lyrics
The night gave you a song
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world
Like you belong there
As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees
There’s something wrong there
Oh la la, I’m not a ghost now
I can see you
You need to see me

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way

I saw you on the stairs
You didn’t notice I was there
That’s ‘cause you were talking at me
And not to me
You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you
Your liberty

It’s the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
It’s the little things that tease and betray
Has the hunter now become the prey?
It’s the little things
The little things that give you away
You might also like
Sometimes
I can’t believe my existence
See myself from a distance
I can’t get back inside
Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died
Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
I'm full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
Sometimes

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
When the painted glass shatters
And you’re the only thing matters
But I can’t see you through the tears
Sometimes
The end is not coming
It’s not coming
The end is here
