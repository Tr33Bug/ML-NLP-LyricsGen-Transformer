The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone) Lyrics
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt

I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name

I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We can hear you (hear you)
We can hear you
We can hear you (hear you, ooh)
You might also like
I woke up at the moment when the miracle had come
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard42Embed
