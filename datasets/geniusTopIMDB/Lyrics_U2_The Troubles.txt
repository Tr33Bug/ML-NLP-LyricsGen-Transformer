The Troubles Lyrics
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

You think it’s easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think it’s easier
To know your own tricks
Well, it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you’re not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control

You think it’s easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
And you think it’s easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to

I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me then, and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you’re not my troubles anymore

Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control

God knows it’s not easy
I'm taking on the shape of someone else’s pain
God, now you can see me
I’m naked and I’m not afraid, my body’s
Sacred and I’m not ashamed

Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til somebody else was in control ('til someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little, they robbed and stole
'Til someone else was in control (someone else is in control)24Embed
