Where the Streets Have No Name Lyrics
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain, yeah
Where the streets have no name, ah-ha

Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
You might also like
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do11Embed
