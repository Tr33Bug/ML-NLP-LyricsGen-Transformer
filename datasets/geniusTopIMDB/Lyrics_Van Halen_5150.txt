5150 Lyrics
The love line is never straight and narrow
Unless your love is tried and true
We take a chance with new beginnings
Still we try, win or lose
Take the highs with the blues

Always one more, you're never satisfied
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you don't know what that means
I feel like running politician
Just trying to please you all the time
I'm giving you my share with no conditions
Going wide, running long
Feeling lost but not for long

Always one more, you're never satisfied
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you don't know what that means


Always one more, you're never satisfied
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you don't know what that meansYou might also like2Embed
