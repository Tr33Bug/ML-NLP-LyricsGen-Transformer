Ain’t Talkin’ ’Bout Love Lyrics

I heard the news, baby
All about your disease
Yeah, you may have all you want, baby
But I got somethin' you need
Oh, yeah!

Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before
Yeah, before
You know you're semi-good lookin'
And on the streets again
Ooh yeah, you think you're really cookin', baby
You better find yourself a friend, my friend

Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't gonna talk about love
Just like I told you before
Before, uh, before, uh, before, before


Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Babe, it's rotten to the core
Ain't talkin' bout love
Just like I told you before
Uh, before

I've been to the edge
And there I stood and looked down
You know I lost a lot of friends there, baby
I got no time to mess around
You might also like
Mmm, so if you want it, got to bleed for it, baby
Yeah! Got to, got to bleed, baby
Mmm, you got to, got to bleed, baby
Hey! Got to, got to bleed, baby

Ain't talkin' 'bout love
My love is rotten to the core
Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Just like I told you before
Before, before

Ain't talkin' 'bout love
Don't wanna talk about love
Don't need to talk about love
Ain't gonna talk about love
No more, no more, ahhh!


Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!4Embed
