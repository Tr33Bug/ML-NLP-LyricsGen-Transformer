Beautiful Girls Lyrics
She was a-seaside sittin'
Just a-smokin' and a-drinkin' on ringside
On top of the world
Oh, yeah
She had her drink in her hand
She had her toes in the sand
And, whoa, what a beautiful girl!
Ah, yeah

(What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit of money)
(To turn your head around)
Creature from the sea with the looks to me
Like she'd like to fool around
What a snappy little mammy
Gonna keep a pappy happy
And accompany me, huh
To the ends of the earth
Ah, yeah
That's why I said

(Here I am)
(Ain't no man of the world, no)
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah!
(Beautiful girls)
Come here, honey, come here, come on

Well, I'm a bum in the sun
And I'm having fun
And I know you know
I got no special plans (Special plans)
All the bills are paid
I got it made in the shade
And all I n-n-need is the woman (Of the sand)

(What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit of money)
(To turn your head around)
Creature from the sea with the looks to me
Like she'd like to fool around
You might also like
(Here I am)
(Ain't no man of the world, no)
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah!
Beautiful girls
Ahh, come this way, baby


Sit down right here
Ooh, la-la
Think I got it now

Now, I'm a-seaside sittin'
Just a-smokin' and a-drinkin' on ringside
On top of the world (Top of the world)
I got a drink in my hand
I got my toes in the sand
All I need is a beautiful girl (Beautiful girl)
Oh yeah!

(Here I am)
(Ain't no man of the world, no)
All I need is a beautiful girl
Ah, yeah!
(Beautiful girls)
Ow, I ain't lyin' to you
Nothin' else I need
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
Sit yourself on down
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
Ow!
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
Ow!
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
Whoo, come here, baby, come here!
Whoa!
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
What's your name, honey, what's your⁠—hey, hey, where you goin'?
Hey! Hey, hey!
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
Hey, this way! Oh!
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
I love 'em, I need 'em
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
Can't do without 'em, no
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow!
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
(Ah, yeah!)
(Beautiful girls)
