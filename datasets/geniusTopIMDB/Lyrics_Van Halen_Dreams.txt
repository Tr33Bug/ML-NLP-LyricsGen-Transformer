Dreams Lyrics
World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune
Yeah, you reach for the golden ring
You reach for the sky
Baby, just spread your wings

And get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind
Run, run, run away
Like a train runnin' off the track
Got the truth bein' left behind
Fall between the cracks
Standin' on broken dreams
Never losin' sight, ah
Well, just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher
Leave it all behind

So baby, dry your eyes
Save all the tears you've cried
Oh, that's what dreams are made of
'Cause we belong
In a world that must be strong
Oh, that's what dreams are made of


Yeah, we'll get higher and higher
Straight up we'll climb
Higher and higher
Leave it all behind
Oh, we'll get higher and higher
Who knows what we'll find
You might also like
So baby, dry your eyes
Save all the tears you've cried
Oh, that's what dreams are made of
Oh, baby, we belong
In a world that must be strong
Oh, that's what dreams are made of


And in the end
On dreams we will depend
'Cause that's what love is made of1Embed
