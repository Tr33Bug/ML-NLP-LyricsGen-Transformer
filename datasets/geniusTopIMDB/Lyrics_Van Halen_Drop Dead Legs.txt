Drop Dead Legs LyricsDrop dead legs, pretty smile
Hurts my head, gets me wild
Dig that steam
Giant butt
Makes me scream
I get nothing, nothing but the shakes over you
And nothing else could ever do

You know that you want it
I know what you need
You know that you want it, baby
When the night is through, will I still be loving you?
Dig those moves, vampire
Set me loose, get it higher
Throw my rope, loop-de-loop
Nice white teeth, Betty Boop
Set it cool, real heavy
I ain't fooled, gettin' ready
Oooh, aw baby

You know that you want it
I know what you need
You know that you want it, baby
When the night is through, will I still be loving you?You might also like2Embed
