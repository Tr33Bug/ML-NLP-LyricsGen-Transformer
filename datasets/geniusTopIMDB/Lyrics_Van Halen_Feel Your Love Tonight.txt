Feel Your Love Tonight Lyrics
Alright
We're gettin' funny in the back of my car
I'm sorry honey if I took you just a little too far, yes
Uh too too far
Uh so I, I told the fellas out behind the bar
So let me tell you honey just how fine you are, yes
I guess you are
You see I'm beggin' you please
(Beggin' you baby, beggin' on my bended knees)
Sayin' I can't wait to feel your love tonight, ooh

Seen you drivin' up and down my road
I tell you honey you're the prettiest girl I know, yes
Uh that's for sure
But uh, better use it up before it gets old, no
I tell you honey now you've let your life grow cold, no
Uh no, no, no
I'm a beggin' you
(Beggin' you baby, beggin' on my bended knees)

I can't wait to feel your love tonight
(I can't wait to feel your love tonight)
I can't wait to feel your love tonight
(I can't wait, I can't wait) Whoo

Well, I been workin' since a ten of nine
I tell you sugar by midnight I'll be fly'n'
Flyin' high
Whoo, we'll hit the town we'll have a hell of a time
I tell you honey by morning you'll be mine, yes
All mine
You know I'm beggin' you baby
(Beggin' you baby, beggin on my bended knees)
