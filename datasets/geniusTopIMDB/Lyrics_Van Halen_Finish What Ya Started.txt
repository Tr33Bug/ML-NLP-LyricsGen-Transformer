Finish What Ya Started LyricsCome on baby
Oh
Whau whau whau
If you wanna see other guys
Baby, I could let it slide
You wanna lover, you want a friend
Mama, I can be both of them
I got the tools to satisfy
Just walk away, if I fall shy at all
Come on baby, finish what you started
I'm incomplete
That ain't no way to treat the broken hearted
I need some sympathy
I like to look the long run
I like to take each step, one by one
Right on time, you will arrive
By keepin' the dream alive
It's alive and it's kicking
Inside of me
So come on baby, please
Come on baby, finish what you started
Oh, I'm incomplete ah
That ain't no way to treat the broken hearted
Come on and finish me
Baby come on
Come on baby
You say yeah
Baby come on
Baby baby baby baby baby bayyyb yeah
Now come on babe, please
Oh baby come on
Come on baby, finish what you started
That ain't no way to treat the broken hearted
Oh oh oh
Come on baby, finish what you started uuh
That ain't no way to treat the broken hearted
Baby, come on
Each step baby, one by one
Baby, come on
Yeah come on
Baby, come on
I got the tools I'll satisfy
Come on baby (baby come on)
Baby come on
Baby come on
Baby come on
So come on baby
