Girl Gone Bad Lyrics
Ah lazy eyes in the summer heat
Fresh from outta town
Now she's working on the street
Shakin' poor boys down

Uh (girl) uh girl gone bad
(Girl) girl gone bad

Found that girl with a lonesome John
But she should've been with me
Guess that woman fallen in love
She don't work for free
Girl gone bad yeah, ah, ah, ah
Girl gone bad
(Girl) girl gone bad

Girl (ow, yeah)
Girl (oh oh oh)
Girl (yeah, yeah)
Girl (say, say)You might also likeEmbed
