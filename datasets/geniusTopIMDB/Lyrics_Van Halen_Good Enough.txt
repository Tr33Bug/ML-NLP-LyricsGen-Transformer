Good Enough Lyrics
Hello, baby, hah!
Yeah, yeah, ow!
Ow..
Dig it
Wow!

U.S. prime, grade-A stamped, guaranteed
Grease it up and turn on the heat
You gotta throw it down and roll it over once, maybe twice
Then chow down, n' down, down n' down
Whoo, she's good enough, good enough to - uh!
Me, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
When it's good enough to - ah!

Hey, oh me? I been working up an appetite
Seems like the harder I work, the more my body needs
Wow, I like to open up, come on, give me six on the half shell
'Cause it's 3-6-9 time

Whoo, 'cause she's good enough, good enough to -  uh!
I can't get enough, I can't get enough

Wow, she's good enough
She's good enough
Good enough
She's good enough to - oh


Hey, waitress, hey, man, you got any specials here tonight?
Me and the fellas might be interested in?
What's that? What? Rack o' what?
Well, I'll have some of that
You might also like
Oooo oo
Oooo oo
Oooo oo

Hey hey hey
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world
(Blind to the world)
'Cause I'm two days gone, and I just can't see
(Just can't see)
Yeah, but I ain't no fool, and, honey, I know a good thing
(Good thing)
And she's comin', she's comin'
Come on, come on, come on come on

Cause she's good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, good enough
Good, good, She's good enough
Good....
Good enough to.... wooooow!!Embed
