Hang â€™Em High LyricsSomewhere, he lost it in a turn
Now trouble seems to fit him like a glove
First come, first served, he's serving it back
Travels light, without a pack, without love
He comes from nowhere, returns on his own
Late for the hanging, yes he's heading for the moon
Hang 'em High
Leather, across his thighs
Blasting out the night, he's terrified to drive
One eye on the road, crashed upon his head
One ear to the ground, he's listening to the dead
He comes from nowhere, returns on his own
Late for the hanging, yes he's heading for the moon
Hang 'em High
Alone to himself, he's laughing up his sleeve
Looking back in anger, the city is relieved
Vision of Light
Child of the night
Passing by

Alone to himself, he's laughing up his sleeve
Looking back in anger, the city is relieved
Vision of Light
Child of the night
Passing by
Leather 'cross his thigh
Blasting out the night, his cap hides his eyes
One eye on the road, price upon his head
One ear to the ground, he's listening to the dead
He comes from nowhere and he turns on his own
Late for the hangin', yes he's headed for the moon
And hang 'em highYou might also likeEmbed
