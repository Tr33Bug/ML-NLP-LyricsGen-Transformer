Hear About It Later Lyrics
Ow!

Ain't got no money, got no house on the hill
Tell me, honey, will your lovin' pay my bills?
Yeah, pay my bills
The neighbors gettin' crazy 'bout the noise next door
It's a major violation, carried away for sure
Yeah, I know
See, I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all
I want a run for my money, that's all
I don't wanna
(I don't wanna hear about it later)
Uh-hear about it later
(I don't wanna, baby, I don't wanna)
I ain't gonna
(I don't wanna hear about it later)
Take it back, baby
(I don't wanna, baby I don't wanna)

Yeah, I'm walkin', don't need no ride
No explanation, just wastin' time, yeah
All my time
I've been tried and convicted, it's winner take all
I want a run for my money, that's all

And I don't wanna
(I don't wanna hear about it later)
I do what I want to
(I don't wanna, baby, I don't wanna)
I ain't gonna
(I don't wanna hear about it later)
Do what I want to you
(I don't wanna, baby I don't wanna)

But you can try me at home, if it feels alright
But I ain't home at night
Ow!


But you can try me at home, if it feels alright
But I ain't home at night
Hahaha!

I don't wanna
I'll do what I please
I don't wanna
I'll maybe do a look 'n move, yeah
Don't look at me baby
Yes, better take my chances
I, I been dreaming 'bout tomorrow
I don't, I don't, I don't
Whaa-ow!
