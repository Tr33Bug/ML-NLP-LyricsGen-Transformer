House of Pain Lyrics
Say you're gonna leave me
'Cause I only tie you up
I always loved you tender
But you only like it rough
Woman bound for glory
Why you're leavin' me again?
Gonna pack your bags
And leave this house of pain

Heartache's all around me
How many times we tried
Said she tried to leave me
But her hands were always tied
If I had it all to do
I'd keep it just the same
Gonna fix it so you never leave
This house of pain
(guitar solo/tempo change)
