Ice Cream Man Lyrics
(Dedicate one to the ladies...)
Now, summertime's here, babe, need somethin' to keep you cool
Ah, now, summertime's here, babe, need somethin' to keep you cool
Better look out now, though, Dave's got somethin' for you
Tell ya what it is

I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by
Oh my, my, I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by
See, now, all my flavors are guaranteed to satisfy
Hold on a second, baby
I got puddin’ pie banana, dixie cups
All flavors and push-ups too

I'm your ice cream man, baby, stop me when I'm passin' by
See, now, all my flavors are guaranteed to satisfy
Hold on, one more

Well, I'm usually passin' by just about eleven o'clock, uh-huh, I never stop
I'm usually passin' by, just around eleven o'clock
And if you let me cool you one time, you'll be my regular stop
All right, boys

I got puddin’ pie banana, dixie cups
All flavors and push-ups too

I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by
See, now, all my flavors are guaranteed to satisfy
Hold on, one more
I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by
I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by
They say all my flavors are guaranteed to satisfy
Ah, one time
You might also like

I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by
I'm your ice cream man, stop me when I'm passin' by
They say all my flavors are guaranteed to satisfy
One time, boys

I'm your ice cream man
I'm your ice cream man
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-baby
Ah my, my, my
All my flavors are guaranteed
To satisfy
