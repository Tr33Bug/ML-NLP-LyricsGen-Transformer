Iâ€™ll Wait Lyrics
You've got me captured, I'm under your spell
I guess I'll never learn
I have your picture, yes, I know it well
Another page is turned
Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

I wrote a letter and told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me
And while she watches, I can never be free
Such good photography

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are


You can't imagine what your image means
The pages come alive
Your magic greets everyone who reads
Heartbreak in motor drive

From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
