Jamie’s Cryin’ Lyrics

She saw the look in his eyes
And she knew better
He wanted her tonight, ah
And it was now or never
He made her feel so sad

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Now Jamie wouldn't say alright
She knew he'd forget her
And so they said goodnight, ooh
And now he's gone forever

She wants to send him a letter, a-yeah yeah
A-just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'

Now Jamie's been in love before (ahh)
And she knows what love is for (ahh)
It should mean, a little, a little more (ahh)
Than one night stands, whoo

She wants to send him a letter, a-yeah yeah
Just to try to make herself feel better
It said "Gimme (gimme a call sometime")
But she knows what that'll get her

Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'
Oh, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'1Embed
