Little Dreamer Lyrics
They may talk about you cold when you were headed for the skies
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that change with a wink of your eye?
Now no one's talkin' 'bout those crazy days gone by
No one talks about the times you cried

(Ooh) Little dreamer
(Ooh) Uh, little dreamer

And then they went and they voted you least likely to succeed
I had to tell them, baby, you were armed with all you'd need
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout those crazy days gone past
Weren't they amazed when you were really last?
(Ooh) You are the little dreamer
(Oooh) You were the little dreamer
Yeah, yeah


Yeah, they talk about you cold when you were headed for the skies
But you were young and bold and baby didn't that change with a wink of your eye?
Seems no one's talkin' 'bout the crazy days gone past
Weren't they amazed when you were really last?

(Ooh) You are the little dreamer
(Ooh) Little dreamer, yeah, oh
(Ooh) Yeah, little dreamer
(Ooh) Little dreamerYou might also likeEmbed
