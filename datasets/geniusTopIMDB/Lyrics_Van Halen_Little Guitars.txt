Little Guitars LyricsSeñorita, I'm in trouble again
And I can't get free (Señorita)
You're exactly what the doctor ordered
Come on, talk to me
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm outta the woods
But there's exceptions to the rule
(Ah) Señorita, do you need a friend?
I'm in love with you
Catch as catch, catch as catch can
Anybody in their right mind could see
It's you and me
Ooh, ooh
You say you're lonesome, just getting by
But you turn your eyes from me
Be sure you're hurting long before you fly
'Cause you got me
Catch as catch, catch as catch can
Anybody in their right mind could see
You and me
Catch as catch, catch as catch can
When I see you and your little guitars sing to me
I can see you don't know which way to turn
But the sun still shines (Señorita)
Don't you know that you can dance with me
Anytime?
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm outta the woods
But there's exceptions to the rule
(Ah) Señorita, do you need a friend?
I'm in love with you
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oohYou might also like4Embed
