On Fire Lyrics
Turn your radios on
I'll appear right there, yes, I will
Turn me up real loud
I'm in your ears

Now I'm hangin' ten now, baby
As I ride your sonic—ooh, wave
(Good God, y'all)
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Oh, yeah
One time

(Fire)
(Fire, fire)

Ow!
Whoo!
Ow! (Ah-ha)
Whoo, whoo

Lay your bodies down
I'm in your beds, your beds
Pull your headphones on
I'm in your heads, ah
You might also like
'N' I'm hangin' ten now, baby
As I ride your sonic—ooh, wave
(Good God, y'all)
Ahh!

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire (Oh!)
I'm on fire (Whoo, whoo)
I'm on fire (Whoo, whoo)
I'm on fire (Ooh)
I'm on fire (Ooh)
I'm on fire
Ow!1Embed
