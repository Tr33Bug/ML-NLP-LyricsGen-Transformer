Poundcake Lyrics
Yeah, she's gotta have soul
Or it won't feel right
Well, just plain, clean and simple
Wrapped up nice and tight

And home grown and down home
That makes a woman
Cookin' up an old time, long lost recipe for me, woo
It's gettin' hard to find
Guess it ain't hip enough now
You take an average guy
He can't identify, uh
And there's a short supply
Of the fine, fine stuff

Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on some of that
Shake it up, pick it up nice, ooh
Here we go, here we go, here we go, oh, yeah
I sure love my baby's poundcake

Homegrown and down home
Oh, yeah, that's a woman
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe

Lemme get on some of that
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
I want some of that
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Gimme some of that
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
You might also like
Ooh, that's some real fine poundcake

I've been out there
Tryin' a little bit of everything
But it's all sex without love
I've found the real thing is poundcake

Home grown and down home
Yeah, that's a woman
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe, yeah, woo
She's down home and down home
Oh, that's my woman

Gimme some of that
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Lemme on that
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh

Home grown and down home, woo
Come on, baby
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
Home grown, way down home, yeah
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Gimme some of that, woo
Come on, babe
Homegrown, homegrown, down home
Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh1Embed
