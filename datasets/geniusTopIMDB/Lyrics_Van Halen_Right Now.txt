Right Now Lyrics
Don't wanna wait 'til tomorrow
Why put it off another day?
One by one, little problems
Build up, and stand in our way, oh
One step ahead, one step behind it
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans or dream about yesterday? Hey
Come on, turn, turn this thing around

Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
Come on, it's everything
Right now
Catch that magic moment
And do it right here and now
It means everything
Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm
And nothing falls into place, no
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace, oh
The more things you get, the more you want
Just trading one for the other
Workin' so hard to make it easy, woah, got to turn
Come on, turn this thing around

Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
Come on, it's everything
Right now
Catch that magic moment
Do it right here and now
It means everything

It's enlightening
Right now
What are you waitin' for?
Oh
Yeah
Right now
You might also like

Right now, hey
It's your tomorrow
Right now
Come on, it's everything
Right now
Catch that magic moment
And do it right here and now (Right now)
Oh, right now

It's what's happening
Right here and now
Right now
It's right now
Oh
Tell me, what are you waiting for?
Turn this thing around6Embed
