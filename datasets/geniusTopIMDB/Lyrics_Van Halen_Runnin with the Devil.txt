Runnin’ with the Devil Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ahh, yeah

I live my life like there's no tomorrow
And all I've got I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills
Ooh, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Ah, Ah-ha yeah, whoo-hoo-ooh
(Runnin' with the devil)
I'll tell y'all about it

I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody waitin' at home

Ahh, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
God damn it lady, you know I ain't lying to ya
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Aah, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Yes I am
Yeah

Whoo
Whoo
You might also like
You know I—
I found the simple life, weren't so simple, no
When I jumped out on that road
Got no love, no love you'd call real
Got nobody waiting at home

(Runnin' with the devil)
(Runnin' with the devil)

Woo

(Runnin' with the devil)
