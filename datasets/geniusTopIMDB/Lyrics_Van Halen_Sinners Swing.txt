Sinnerâ€™s Swing Lyrics
Alright, you sinners, swing

Danger in the rearview mirror, there's trouble in the wind
Badness bringin' up the rear, the menace is loose again
She looks so fuckin' good, so sexy and so frail
Something got the bite on me, I'm goin' straight to hell

And now we're wastin' time
Now we're wastin' time
Same old pickup lines
Same old pickup lines
And you keep tryin'
Don't waste time
Uh, come back to your senses, baby, we can come to terms
I can almost t-taste it, it burns
You'd be sittin' pretty, but you try to take the fifth
Wearin' out my welcome, guess I better save my breath

And now we're wastin' time
Now we're wastin' time
Same old pickup lines
Same old pickup lines
And you keep tryin'
But you keep tryin'
Don't waste time

Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push


Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
You might also like
Soon you'll see my silhouette a-darkenin' your door
I can almost t-taste it, I want more
No one's above suspicion, no one's got it wired
I may burn my fingers, want my iron in that fire

And now we're wastin' time
Now we're wastin' time
Same old pickup lines
Same old pickup lines
And you keep tryin'
But you keep tryin'
Don't waste time

Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Babe, get back, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get back, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Ah, babe
Get, get, get, get, get out and push
Alright, you sinners, swing1Embed
