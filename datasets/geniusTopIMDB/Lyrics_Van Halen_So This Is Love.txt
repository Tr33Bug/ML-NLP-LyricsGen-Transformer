So This Is Love? LyricsOh, yeah
Check me out on the good side here
Well, my baby's on the corner and she's lookin' so fine
Put one and one together and it blowed my mind
A man needs love to live, I'm the living proof
Catch that smile and I hit the roof
Big double take but you keep on walking
I'm in love
Once over, I'm overdone
So this is love?
Ooh, I need your lovin'
Come on baby, take me home
So this is love?
Ooh, I need your lovin'
I'm just skin and bones
Goin' out my way, know my way around
The grass is never greener and there's plenty around
All the other girls, they be put to shame
Over the edge and here I'll stay
Got me on pins and needles
And she knows
She's mine and ain't lettin' go
So this is love?
Ooh, I need your love
Baby, take me home
So this is love?
Ooh, I need your lovin'
I know
Got me on pins and needles
Yes, she knows
She's mine and ain't lettin' go
