Somebody Get Me a Doctor Lyrics
You better call me a doctor, feelin' no pain
Overloaded, down the drain
Somebody get me a doctor

You better call up the ambulance, I'm deep in shock
Overloaded, baby, I can hardly walk
Somebody get me a doctor
Somebody get me a doctor
Feelin' over fine
And I'm speedin' down that line

You better call up a doctor, feelin high
I'm overloaded baby, I say "Bye-bye!"
Somebody get me a doctor
Somebody get me a doctor
Somebody get me a doctor

Somebody get me a shot!You might also like1Embed
