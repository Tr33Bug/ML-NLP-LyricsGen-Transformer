Top of the World Lyrics
Hey, baby, woo

I know that you believe in me
That's all I ever need, uh-huh
No, no, nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing will be scaring me, oh, no
Hey, baby
Yeah, it's the only way out
Oh, little darling
Now, come on, what's it all about?
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got

Oh, I know it won't hurt
I got to have a little taste
I just wanna sink my teeth in that fine piece of real estate, yeah
Hey, baby
Woo, make it nice and sweet
Oh, little darling
Let's take a walk down easy street

Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Let's give it all we got

Baby, got a feeling
Oh, I wanna touch it now
See the whole wide world turn upside down
You might also like
Hey, baby, woo
Someday, we'll be

Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
'Til we got stung
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got
(Standing on top) Hey, baby
(Standing on top) Hey, darling, woo
Standing on top
Standing on top
