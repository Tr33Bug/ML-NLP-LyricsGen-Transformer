Unchained Lyrics
All right!
Ha ha haha!

You said
"I cannot get there from here, baby"
And I don't care where I'm goin'
Here's to your thin red line
I'm stepping over
Thought you'd never miss me
'Til I got a Fat City address
Non-stop talker, what a rocker!
Blue-eyed murder in a size five dress
Change, nothing stays the same
Unchained, yeah, you hit the ground running
Change, ain't nothing stays the same
Unchained, yeah, you hit the ground running
No, I don't ask for permission
This is my chance to fly
Maybe enough ain't enough for you
But it's my turn at a try
Thought you'd never miss me
'Til I got a Fat City address
Non-stop talker, what a rocker!
Blue-eyed murder in a size five dress
Change, nothing stays the same
Unchained, and ya hit the ground running
Change, ain't nothing stays the same
Unchained, yeah, ya hit the ground running

Unchained, yeah, ya hit the ground running
Change, ain't nothing stays the same
Unchained, yeah, ya hit the ground running
Whoo hooo! Take a look at this!
Hey, man, that suit is you! Whoo-eee!
You'll get some leg tonight for sure!
Tell us how you do! Woo hoo hoo hoo
(Come on, Dave, give me a break)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, one break coming up!
Change, ain't nothing stays the same
Unchained, yeah, ya hit the ground running
Change, ain't nothing stays the same
Unchained, yeah, ya hit the ground running
Change, ain't nothing stays the same
Unchained, yeah, ya hit the ground running
Change, ain't nothing stays the same
