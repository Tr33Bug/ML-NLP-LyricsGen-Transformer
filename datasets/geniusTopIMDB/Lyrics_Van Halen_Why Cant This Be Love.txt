Why Canâ€™t This Be Love Lyrics
Oh, here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey, I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much
Hey
And I can't recall
Any love at all
Oh, baby, this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

I tell myself
Hey, only fools rush in
Only time will tell if we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned if I'll get
Hung up on the line, hey

No, I can't recall
Anything at all
Ah, baby, this blows 'em all away
Woo
You might also like
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
You want it straight from the heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?


Woo, it's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from the heart
Tell me why can't this be love?

Baby, why can't this be love?
Got to know why can't this be love?
I wanna know why can't this be love?3Embed
