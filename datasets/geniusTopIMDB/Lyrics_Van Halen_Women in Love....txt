Women in Love... Lyrics
My heart, you're breakin' my heart
Girl, you better start
Thinkin' somethin' real
Seems like lovin' you is just a crazy dream
But do as you feel

All these crazy women
One more crazy night
But one night's all we're given
So, baby, leave me alone
Or, baby, stay the night
(Oh, women in love)
Oh baby, make up your mind
(Make up your mind)
I know you're in love
(Oh, women in love)
So, baby, make up your mind
(Women in love)
Scream, go on and scream
That your love is all you're knowin'
But, honey, if you're needin' a woman
Just as bad as me, you oughta be goin'

All these crazy women
One more crazy night
But one night's all we're given
So, honey, leave me alone
Or, baby, you're stayin' the night


All these crazy women
Ah, just one more crazy night
But one night's all we're given
So, honey, leave me alone
Or, lady, you're stayin' the night
(Oh, women in love)
Baby, make up your mind
(Make up your mind)
And I know you're in love
(Oh, women in love)
Ooh, babe, I know you're in love
(Women in love)
