Youâ€™re No Good Lyrics
Well, I'm feelin' better now that we're through
Feelin' better, baby, I'm over you
I learned my lesson, baby, and it left a scar
But now I see how you really are

You're no good, no good
Baby, you're no good
No good, no good, no good
Baby, you're no good
I broke a heart, simple and true
Broke a heart for someone like you
We'll be coming back, don't come running to me
I wanna love you, maybe set you free

You're no good, no good, no good
Baby, you're no good
You're no good, no good, no good
Baby, you're no good

Used to be, I couldn't sleep at night, baby
Now, you go on, do what you want toYou might also like4Embed
