Bright Side of the Road LyricsFrom the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Little darlin' come with me
Won't you help me share my load
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Into this life we're born
Baby sometimes, sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Let's enjoy it while we can
(Let's enjoy it while we can)
Won't you help me share my load (help me share my load)
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Into this life we're born
Baby sometimes, baby sometimes we don't know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Let's enjoy it while we can
(Let's enjoy it while we can)
Won't you help me sing my song (help me sing my song)
Little darling come along
To the bright side of the road
On the dark end of the street (on the dark end of the street)
To the bright side of the road (to the bright side of the road)
Little darling come along
On the bright side of the road
On the dark end of the street (on the dark end of the street)
To the bright side of the road (to the bright sight of the road)
We'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Yeah, we'll be, we'll be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We'll be lovers once again
