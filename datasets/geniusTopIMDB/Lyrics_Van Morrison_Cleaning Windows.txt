Cleaning Windows Lyrics
Oh, the smell of the bakery from across the street
Got in my nose
As we carried our ladders down the street
With the wrought-iron gate rows
I went home and listened to Jimmie Rodgers
In my lunch-break
Bought five Woodbines at the shop on the corner
And went straight back to work

Oh, Sam was up on top
And I was on the bottom with the V
We went for lemonade and Paris buns
At the shop and broke for tea
I collected from the lady and I cleaned the fanlight
Inside-out
I was blowing saxophone on the weekend
In that down joint
What's my line?
I'm happy cleaning windows
Take my time
I'll see you when my love grows
Baby don't let it slide
I'm a working man in my prime
Cleanin' windows
(number thirty-six)

I heard Leadbelly and Blind Lemon
On the street where I was born, yeah
Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee and Muddy Waters singin'
"I'm A Rolling Stone"
I went home
And read my Christmas Humphreys' book on Zen
Curiosity killed the cat
Kerouac's "Dharma Bums" and "On The Road"

What's my line?
I'm happy cleaning windows, hey
Take my time
I'll see you when my love grows
Baby, don't let it slide
I'm a working man in my prime
Cleanin' windows
You might also like
Say again
What's my line?
I'm happy cleaning windows
Well, I take my time
I'll see you when my love grows
Don't let it slide
I'm a working man in my prime
Cleanin' windows

Alright, cleanin'
What'd you say number
Number a-hundred and twenty-six
Alright, we'll be right tomorrowEmbed
