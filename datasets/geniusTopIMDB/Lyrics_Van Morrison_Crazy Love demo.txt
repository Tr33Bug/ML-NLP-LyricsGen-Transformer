Crazy Love (demo) LyricsI can hear her heart beat from a thousand miles
Yeah the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
Yeah I need her in the daytime
And I need her in the night
Yeah and I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss and hug her kiss and hug her tight
And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yeah and it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it make me mellow down in to my soul

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
