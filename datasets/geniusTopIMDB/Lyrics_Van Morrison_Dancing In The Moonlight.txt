Dancing In The Moonlight LyricsWe get it almost every night
And when that moon gets big and bright
It's supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
We like our fun and we never fight
You can't dance and stay uptight
It's supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
Everybody here is out of sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and bright
It's such a fine and natural sight
Everybody's dancing in the moonlight
