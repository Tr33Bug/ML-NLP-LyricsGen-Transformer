Days Like This Lyrics
When it's not always raining
There'll be days like this
When there's no one complaining
There'll be days like this
Everything falls into place
Like the flick of a switch
Well my mama told me
There'll be days like this

When you don't need to worry
There'll be days like this
When no one's in a hurry
There'll be days like this
When you don't get betrayed
By that old Judas kiss
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
When you don't need an answer
There'll be days like this
When you don't meet a chancer
There'll be days like this
When all the parts of the puzzle
Start to look like they fit
Then I must remember
There'll be days like this

When everyone is up front
And they're not playing tricks
When you don't have no freeloaders
Out to get their kicks
When it's nobody's business
The way that you want to live
I just have to remember
There'll be days like this

When no one steps on my dreams
There'll be days like this
When people understand what I mean
There'll be days like this
When you ring out the changes
Of how everything is
Well my mama told me
There'll be days like this
You might also like
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like this
Oh my mama told me
There'll be days like thisEmbed
