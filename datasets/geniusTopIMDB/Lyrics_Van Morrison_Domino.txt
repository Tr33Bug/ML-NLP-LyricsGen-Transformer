Domino LyricsDon't want to discuss it
Think it's time for a change
You may get disgusted
Start thinking that I'm strange
That case I'll go underground
Get some heavy rest
Never have to worry
About what is worst or what is best
Oh oh Domino
Roll me over, Romeo
There you go
I said, oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
I said oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino
There's no need for argument
There's no argument at all
And if you never hear from him
That just means he didn't call
Or vice versa
That depends on wherever you're at
And if you never hear from me
That just means I would rather not
Oh oh Domino
Roll me over, Romeo
There you go
I said, oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Say't again, oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino
Hey, mister DJ! I just wanna hear some
Rhythm and Blues music on the radio
On the radio, on the radio...
And the band!You might also like3Embed
