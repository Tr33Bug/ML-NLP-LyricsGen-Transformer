Everyone Lyrics
We shall walk again down along the lane
Down the avenue just like we used to do
With our heads so high, smile at passers by
Then we'll softly sigh ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone

By the winding stream we shall lay and dream
We'll make dreams come true if we want them to
Yes, all will come play the pipes and drum
Sing a happy song and we'll sing along
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone


We shall walk again all along down the lane
Down the avenue just like we used to do
With our heads so high, smile at passers by
Then we'll softly sigh ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyoneYou might also like1Embed
