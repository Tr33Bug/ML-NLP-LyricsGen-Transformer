Fair Play Lyrics
Fair play to you, Killarney's lakes are so blue
And the architecture I'm taking in with my mind so fine
Tell me of Poe, Oscar Wilde, and Thoreau
Let your midnight and your daytime turn into love of life

It's a very fine line
But you've got the mind, child, to carry on
When it's just about to be carried on
And there's only one meadow's way to go
And you say "Geronimo"
There's only one meadow's way to go
And you say "Geronimo"

A paperback book as we walk down the street
Fill my mind with tales of mystery, mystery and imagination
Forever fair and I'm touching your hair
I wish we could be dreamers in this dream, oh, let it dream

And there's only one meadow's way to go
And you say "Geronimo"
And there's only one meadow's way to go
And you say "Geronimo"

Fair play to you, Killarney's lakes are so blue
High-ho silver, tit for tat and I love you for that
High-ho silver, tit for tat and I love you for that
Love you for that, love you for that
High-ho silver, tit for tat, tit for tat and I love you for that
High-ho silver, tit for tat
Yeah, yeah, and I love you for that
You might also like
And there's only one meadow's way to go
And I, and I say "Geronimo"
And there's only one meadow's way to go
And we say "Geronimo, Geronimo"

And there's only one meadow's way to go
And we say Geronimo
And there's only one meadow's way to go
And we say Geronimo

Fair play to youEmbed
