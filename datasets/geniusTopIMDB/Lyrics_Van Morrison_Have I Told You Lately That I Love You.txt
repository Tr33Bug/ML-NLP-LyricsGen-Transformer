Have I Told You Lately That I Love You? LyricsHave I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Now the mornin' sun in all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort, too
You fill my life with laughter
You can make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and mine, like the sun
At the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray to the One
And to say, 'Have I told you lately that I love you?'
Have I told ya there's no one above you?
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and mine
And it shines like the sun
At the end of the day
We should give thanks
And pray to the One
And so
(applause)
