Iâ€™ll Be Your Lover, Too LyricsI'll be your man
I'll understand
Do my best to take good care of you
Yes I will
You'll be my queen
I'll be your king
And I'll be your lover too
Yes, I will
Derry down green
Color of my dream
A dream that's daily
Coming true
I'll tell you
When day is through
I will come to you
And tell you of your many charms
And you'll look at me
With eyes that see
And melt into
Each other's arms
And so I come
To be the one
Who's always standing
Next to you
Reach out for me
So I can be alright
The one who's always reaching out for you
Yes I will, yes I will
You'll be my queen
I'll be your king
And I'll be your lover tooYou might also likeEmbed
