Iâ€™m Not Feeling It Anymore Lyrics
Have to get back, have to get back the base
I need to talk to somebody I can trust
Too many cooks are tryin' to spoil the broth
I can't feel it in my throat, that's all she wrote

I'm not feeling it no more
I'm not feeling it anymore
Not feelin' it no more
Not feelin' it anymore
When I was high at the party everything looked good
I was seein' through rose-coloured glasses
Not seein' the wood for the trees
I started out in normal operation
But I just ended up in doubt
All my drinking buddies, they locked me out

I'm not feelin' it no more
I'm not feelin' it anymore
No feelin' it no more
I'm tryin' to give you the score

You see me up there baby, I'm on the screen
But I know better now, it's so unreal
If this is success then something's awful wrong
'Cause I bought the dream and I had to play along

I'm not feelin' it no more
I'm not feelin' it anymore
I'm tryin' to give you the score
I'm not feelin' it no more
You might also like
We all know that money don't buy you love
You just get a job and somewhere to live
You have to look for happiness within yourself
And don't go chasin' thinkin' that it is somewhere else

I'm not feelin' it no more
I'm not feelin' it anymore
Baby I'm tryin' to give you the score
I'm not feelin' it no more

I was pretendin' all the time
I was givin' everybody what they wanted
And I lost my peace of mind
And all I ever wanted was simply just to be me
All you ever need is the truth
And the truth will set you free, yeah

I'm not feelin' it no more
I'm not feelin' it anymore
I'm tryin' to give you the score
Just like I did before
I'm not feelin' it no more
I'm not feelin' it anymore
I'm not feelin' it no more
Baby I'm just trying to give you the score
(I'm not feelin' it anymore)
I'm not feelin' it no more
Not feelin' it anymore
Not feelin' it no more
Not feelin' it no more baby
(Not feelin' it anymore)Embed
