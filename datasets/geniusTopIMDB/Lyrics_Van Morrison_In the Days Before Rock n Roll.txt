In the Days Before Rock ‘n’ Roll LyricsJustin, gentler than a man
I am down on my knees
At the wireless knobs
I am down on my knees
At those wireless knobs
Telefunken, Telefunken
And I'm searching for
Luxembourg, Luxembourg
Athlone, Budapest, AFN
Hilversum, Helvetia
In the days before rock 'n' roll
In the days before rock 'n' roll
In the days before rock 'n' roll
When we let, then we bet
On Lester Piggott when we met
We let the goldfish go
In the days before rock 'n' roll
Fats
Fats did not come in
Without those wireless knobs
Fats did not come in
Without those wireless knobs
Elvis did not come in
Without those wireless knobs
Nor Fats, nor Elvis
Nor Sonny, nor Lightning
Nor Muddy, nor John Lee
In the days before rock 'n' roll
In the days before rock 'n' roll
When we let and we bet
On Lester Piggott, 10 to 1
And we let the goldfish go
Down the stream
Before rock 'n' roll

We'd get Luxembourg
Luxembourg and Athlone
AFM stars of Jazz
Come in, come in, come in, Ray Charles
Come in, the high priest
In the days before rock 'n' roll
In the days before rock 'n' roll
When we let and we bet
On Lester Piggott 10 to 1
And we let the goldfish go
And then, and then, then the Killer came along
The Killer, Killer Jerry Lee Lewis
A Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On
Great Balls of Fire
Little Richard
Justin, gentler than a man
Justin, Justin, where is Justin now?
What's Justin doing now?
Just where is Justin now?
