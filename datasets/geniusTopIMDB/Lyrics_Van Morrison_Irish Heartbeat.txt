Irish Heartbeat Lyrics
Oh won't you stay?
Stay a while with your own ones
Don't ever stray
Stray so far from your own ones
'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
That you share with your own ones

Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones
Just one more day
One more day with your own ones
And the world is so cold
Don't care nothing 'bout your soul
That you share with your own ones
There's a stranger and he's standing at your door
Might be your best friend, might be your brother
You may never know

I'm going back
Going back to my own ones
I'm back to talk
Talk awhile with my own ones
'Cause the world is so cold
Don't care nothing 'bout your soul
You share with your own ones

Oh won't you stay?
One more day with your own ones
Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones
This old world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own onesYou might also likeEmbed
