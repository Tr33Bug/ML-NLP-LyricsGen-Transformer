Someone Like You LyricsI've been searchin' a long time
For someone exactly like you
I've been travelling all around the world
Waiting for you to come through
Someone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
I've been travellin' a hard road
Baby, lookin' for someone exactly like you
I've been carrying my heavy load
Waitin' for the light to come shining through
Someone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
I've been doing some soul searching
Find out where you're at
I've been up and down the highway
And all kinds of foreign lands
Someone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
I've been all around the world
Marching to the beat of a different drum
But just lately I've realized
Baby, the best is yet to come
You might also likeSomeone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
The best is yet to comeEmbed
