They Own the Media LyricsThey tell us that ignorance is bliss
I guess by those that control the media, it is
They own the media, they control the stories we are told
If you ever try to go against them, you will be ignored
'Cause they control
They control
They control
They control the narrative, they perpetuate the myth
Keep on telling you lies, tell you ignorance is bliss
Believe it all and you'll never get, nеver get wise
To thе truth, 'cause they control everything you do
Everything you do
Everything you do
Everything you do
They control the narrative, they perpetuate the myth
Keep on telling you lies, tell you ignorance is bliss
Believe it all and you'll never get the truth
Never get wise, wise through their lies
Through their lies
Through their lies
They control the media
They control the media
