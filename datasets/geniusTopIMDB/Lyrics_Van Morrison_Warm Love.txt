Warm Love Lyrics
Look at the ivy on the old clingin' wall
Look at the flowers and the green grass so tall
It's not a matter of when push comes to shove
It's just the hour on the wings of a dove

That's just warm love
It's just warm love

I dig it when you're fancy dressed up in lace
I dig it when you have a smile on your face
This inspiration's got to be on the flow
These invitation's got to see it and know
It's just warm love
It's just warm love

And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
Warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm love

To the country I'm goin'
Lay and laugh in the sun
You can bring your guitar along
We'll sing some songs and have some fun

The sky is cryin' and it's time to go home
And we shall hurry to the car from the foam
Sit by the fire and dry out our wet clothes
It's rainin' outside from the skies up above

Inside it's warm love
Inside it's warm love
You might also like
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm love
Can't you feel it?
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm love
And it's everpresent everywhere
And it's everpresent everywhere
That warm loveEmbed
