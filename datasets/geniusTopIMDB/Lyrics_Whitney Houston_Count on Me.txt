Count on Me Lyrics
Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me

I can see it's hurting you
I can feel your pain
It's hard to see the sunshine through the rain
I know sometimes it seems as if
It's never gonna end
But you'll get through it
Just don't give in because you can
Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me
You can count on me
Yes you can

I know sometimes it seems as if
We're standing all alone
But we'll get through it
Because love won't let us fall

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me
You might also like
There's a place inside all of us
Where our faith in love begins
You should reach to find the truth in love
The answer's there within, oh
I know that life can make you feel
It's much harder than it really is
But we'll get through it
Just (just) don't (don't) give in

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me, I will be there
Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on, Count on, Count on
Count on, Count on, Count on
Count on me
O, yes you can
No, I can't
Sure you can
Noo
So glad I can
