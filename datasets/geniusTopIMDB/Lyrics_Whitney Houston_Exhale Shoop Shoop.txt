Exhale (Shoop Shoop) Lyrics
Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong
And sometimes it's right
For every win
Someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (Yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, Shoop, Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Yeah)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
(All you got to say is shoo be doop)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be doop)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doo
Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us
The when's or why's
When you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find a point when
You will exhale (Yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, Shoop, Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo shoo shoo huh)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Say shoop say shoo be say shoo be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Say shoo-hoo say sho)
Shoo Be Doo (Be doo oh)

Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's
Answers to your prayers
If you're searching for
A place you know
A familiar face
Somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there
You might also like
Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us
The when's or why's
When you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find a point when
You will exhale (Yeah, yeah, say)

Shoop, Shoop, Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo-hoo-hoo be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be doop doop doop hoo hoo hoo)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Do do shoo be shoo be feels alright)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (You can say oh)
