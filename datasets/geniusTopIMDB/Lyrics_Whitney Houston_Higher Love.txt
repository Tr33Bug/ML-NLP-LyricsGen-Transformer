Higher Love Lyrics
Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart and I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere (Everywhere)
In this whole world, what is fair
We will walk the line and try to see (Try to see)
Falling behind in what could be, oh-ooh, oh
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of

Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning, yeah, and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me, yeah

Things look so bad everywhere (Everywhere)
In this whole world, what is fair
We walk the line and try to see (Try to see)
Falling behind in what could be, oh-ooh, oh

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love, my love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I've been thinking of
You might also like
I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it, no, no
Until then I'll sing my song, yeah, uh
To cheer the night along, oh-oh-oh


I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Oh, let me feel that love come over me
Oh, let me feel how strong it could be
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no

Bring me a higher love, my lover
Bring me a higher love, oh, oh, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love (Oh, why don't ya?)
Bring me a higher love, oh (You gotta bring it to me)
Bring me a higher love (Bring me, you bring me love)
A higher love I keep thinking of, oh
Bring me a higher love (Bring me love)
Bring me a higher love, oh (Bring me a higher love)
Bring me a higher love (Bring me, you bring me, yeah)
A higher love I keep thinking of, oh
Bring me a higher love (Oh, bring me, bring it on me, oh)
Bring me a higher love, oh (Bring it on, oh-oh, whoa)
Bring me a higher love (Bring me, bring me my love)
A higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love (Bring me, bring me, oh, yeah)
Bring me a higher love, oh (Bring me a higher love, can you feel it?)
Bring me a higher love (I don't feel it, I don't feel a higher love)
A higher love I've been thinking of (Oh)
Bring me a higher love (Bring me a higher love)
Bring me a higher love, oh (Bring me a higher love)
Bring me a higher love (Bring me, you bring me, yeah)
A higher love I keep thinking of, ohEmbed
