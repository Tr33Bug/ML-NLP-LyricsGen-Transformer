His Eye Is On The Sparrow Lyrics
Why should I feel discouraged
And Why should the shadows, shadows come
Lord Why, Why, Why should my heart, my heart feel lonely
And long for heaven, heaven and home, oh-yes
When, when Jesus, Jesus is, he is my portion
A, A constant Friend, constant Friend is He
Oh, oh-oh, his eye is on, his eye is on the sparrow
Oh yes I, I know He watches all over me
Yeah, hey
I sing (I sing)
I sing because (because)
I'm happy (happy)
Hallelujah

I sing (I sing)
I sing because (Because)
I'm free (I'm free)
I'm free
I know, I know his eye (His eye), hmm
His eye is on (Is on)
Is on the sparrow (Sparrow), oh yes he is
I know (Know), I know (And I know)
He watches, thank you Lord, over meYou might also like3Embed
