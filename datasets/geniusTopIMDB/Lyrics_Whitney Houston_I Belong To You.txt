I Belong To You Lyrics
In a world where dreams are few
You've got me baby, I've got you
You're the one that makes me feel brand new
Sometimes love can wear you out
Chill your soul, baby, make you doubt
That's you'll never find the one that's true

All my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss
I want to know
And nothin's gonna stop me because
I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you

Though I'm not afraid to let it show
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know
There's nobody who does me like you do, boy

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothing has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothin's gonna stop me because

I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you
You might also like
When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you
To you

Say that you love me boy and I'll make it right Oh yeah
I'll rock your heart and soul 'til the morning light
Boy no
I will, oh yeah yeah

You know I belong to you
And you belong to me

All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothing has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothin's gonna stop me because
I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you

When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you
To you

I belong to you, baby
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
When you get down to it
I belong to you
I belong to you, baby
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me
I belong to you
You belong to me, yeah2Embed
