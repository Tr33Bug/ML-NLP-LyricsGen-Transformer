I Learned from the Best Lyrics
Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart one more time, oh, no, no
Did you think that I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back in my life
So you found you miss the love you threw away
Baby but you found it out too late, too Late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh baby now)
I learned from you
I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye baby
Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Now you say you're sorry and
You've changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh baby now)
I learned from you

So when all you've got are sleepless nights
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you who said goodbye
Who said goodbye
You might also like

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you
Learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you
I learned from the best
I learned from you1Embed
