TranslationsΕλληνικάI Will Always Love You Lyrics
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I
Will always love you, ooh, I
Will always love you, you
You, my darling, you, mm

Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I, I
Will always love you, ooh, I
Will always love you, you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I'm wishing you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I, I
Will always love you, ooh
I will always love you
I will always love you, ooh
I will always love you, ooh
I will always love you, ooh
I, I will always love you
You might also like
You, darling, I love you
Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you80Embed
