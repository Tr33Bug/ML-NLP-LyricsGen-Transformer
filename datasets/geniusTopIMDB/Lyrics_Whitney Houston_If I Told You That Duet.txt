If I Told You That (Duet) Lyrics
Darkchild
Hey, baby
Hahaha

If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that
Now tell me how you'd feel
If I told you that I
Had feelings for you, yeah
Tell me, baby
And would it be so wrong
To say what's on my mind
I'm sorry, I have to
Baby, baby

And we're friends, but with time
What I feel deep inside (What I feel inside)
For you (For you) has changed (Has changed)
But I'd give up on love (Ooh)
If I thought that it was (If I thought it was)
Untrue (Untrue) for you (For you, baby)

If I told you that (Uh-huh)
I wanted to see you (I wanted to see you)
And if I told you that (And if I told you)
I beg to please you (Beg to, beg to, beg to please you)
If I told you that (If I told you)
I'll always keep you (If I told you, always keep you)
What would you say
If I told you that? (Uh)
You might also like
I know that we were just friends
But what if I decide
To bring something in, ooh yeah
Baby, baby
I hope it won't offend
The trust we have 'cause I
Don't want this to end
No, no, no, baby

If you think we will lose what we have
Then I'd just rather stay (Rather stay) the same (Rather stay the same)
Because I don't want to choose (I don't wanna choose)
Between two of the most precious things (Precious things) to me (To me)

If I told you that (I told you that)
I wanted (I wanted) to see you (I wanted to see you)
And if I told you that (If I told you)
I beg to please you (I'd beg to please you)
If I told you that (My love)
I'll always keep you (I'll always keep you)
What would you say (What would you say?)
If I told you that?
If we (If we) take this chance (Take this chance)
And extend to each other romance
I hope (Baby, I hope) it would be (It would be)
The right thing for you and me, oh

If I told you that (Baby-baby, baby-baby)
I wanted (I wanted) to see you (I wanted to see you)
And if I told you that (If I told you)
I beg to please you (I beg to please you)
If I told you that (If I told you, if I told you)
I'll always keep you (If I said)
What would you say (What would you say?)
If I told you that? (What would, would you say, baby?)

If I told you that (If I told you that)
I wanted to see you (I wanna really, really see you)
And if I told you that (If I told you)
I beg to please you (If I said, beg to please you)
If I told you that (If I told you)
I'll always keep you (I'll always keep you)
What would you say (What would you say?)
If I told you that? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Would you (Would you)
Be there for me? (Be there)
Could you
Dare to hold me? (Dare to hold me)
Will my (Will my)
Feelings leave me (Will my)
Lonely? (What would you say?)
If I told you

If I told you that (If I told you)
I wanted to see you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And if I told you that (If I told you that)
I beg to please you (I beg to please you, oh)
If I told you that (My love)
I'll always keep you (I'll always)
What would you say (What would you say?)
If I told you that?

Would you
Be there for me?
And if I told you that (You know I'd love to)
I'd beg to please you (I'd beg to please you)
If I told you that (Will my)
I'll always keep you (Feelings leave me)
What would you say (Lonely)
If I told you that? (If I told you)
If I told you that (Would you)
I wanted to see you (Be there for me?)1Embed
