If I Told You That Lyrics
Darkchild
Hey baby
Ha ha ha

If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that?
Now tell me how you'd feel
If I told you that I
Have feelings for you, baby
And would it be so wrong
To say what's on my mind?
I'm sorry I have to, baby, baby

We were friends, but with time
What I feel, deep inside
For you (for you)
Has changed (has changed)
But I'd give up on love
If I thought, that it was
Untrue (untrue)
For you (for you, baby)

If I told you that (uh-huh)
I wanted to see you (I wanted to see you)
And if I told you that (and if I told you)
I beg to please you (to please you)
If I told you that (if I told you)
I'll always keep you (I'll always keep you)
What would you say
If I told you that? (uh)
You might also like
I know that we're just friends
But what if I decide
To bring something in, ooh yeah?
Uh, I hope it won't offend
The trust we have, 'cause I
Don't want this to end
No no no, baby

If you think we will lose
What we have, then I'd just
Rather stay (rather stay)
The same (the same, baby)
Because I don't want to choose
Between two of the most precious things (precious things)
To me (to me, oh yeah)

If I told you that (if I told you that)
I wanted to see you (I wanted to see you)
And if I told you that (and if I told you)
I beg to please you (to please you, boo)
If I told you that (and if I told you)
I'll always keep you (I'll always keep you)
What would you say (what would you say?)
If I told you that?
If we take this chance
And extend to each other's romance
And I hope it would be the
The right thing for you and me, oh yeah

If I told you that (Baby baby, baby baby)
I wanted to see you (I wanted to see)
And if I told you that (and if I told you)
I beg to please you (I beg to please you, oh)
If I told you that (if I told you, if I told you)
I'll always keep you (if I said)
What would you say (what would you say?)
If I told you that? (what would you say, baby?)
If I told you that (and if I told you that)
I wanted to see you (if I wanna be the realest to you)
And if I told you that (if I told you)
I beg to please you (I beg to please you)
If I told you that (if I told you)
I'll always keep you (I'll always keep you)
What would you say
If I told you that? (what would you say, oh?)

Would you (would you)
Be there for me? (be there)
Could you (say, could you)
Dare to hold me? (dare to hold me)
Will my (will my)
Feelings leave me (baby baby)
Love only (what would you say?)
If I told you? (oh yeah)

If I told you that (if I told you)
I wanted to see you (and then if I told you)
And if I told you that (if I told you that)
I beg to please you (I beg to please you)
If I told you that (my love)
I'll always keep you (I'll always, I'll always)
What would you say (what would you say?)
If I told you that?
If I told you that
I wanted to see you (hey)
And if I told you that (you know I love you)
I beg to please you
If I told you that
I'll always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that?Embed
