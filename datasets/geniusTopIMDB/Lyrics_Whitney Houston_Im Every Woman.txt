Iâ€™m Every Woman Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
It's all in me
Yeah
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa (Oh), whoa (Oh), whoa

I can cast a spell
Secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly I will appear, oh

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa (Oh), whoa (Oh), whoa
You might also like
Oh, I can sense your needs
Like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old-fashioned love
I've got it, I've got it
I've got it, got it, baby, baby

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it, naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa (Oh), whoa (Oh), whoa

I ain't bragging
'Cause I'm the one
Just ask me
Ooh, it shall be done
And don't bother
To compare
I've got it
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Aah, yeah, yeah, got it)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Got it, got it, yeah)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Aah, aah, aah)
I'm every woman (I'm every woman)
I'm every woman (Every need, baby)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Every woman, baby)
I'm every woman (Uuh)
I'm every woman (Every woman, baby)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman
I'm every woman (My girl)7Embed
