Like I Never Left Lyrics
Konvict, Konvict
Akon and Whitney, yeah
(Oh yeah)

Did you ever wish (Wish) you could get back
Something that you did in your past? (Yeah)
If it wasn't for me, I know what we had
Was definitely gonna last
I admit (I admit) that we say some things
We don't mean when we're mad (Yeah)
But I realize that I've been foolish (Yeah)
I never should have turned my back (Yeah)
'Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone (All alone)
So many times that I wanted to just pick up the phone (Pick up the phone)
And tell you, "Ooh baby, baby, I missed your loving so."
I ain't holding back no more (Yeah)
Your girl is coming home (Yeah)

And I want you to love me (Like I never left, left)
And I want you to hold me (Like I never left, left)
And I want you to touch me (Like I never left, left)
Come give me what I'm missing, yeah (Like I never left, yeah)

Do you think (Think) we can pick up
Where we left before the day? (The day, yeah)
That I told you it was over
Packed my things and moved away (Away)
'Cause I see (See) that without you
My world is just an empty place (Place)
Taking one step away from you feels like a million miles away

'Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone (All alone)
So many times I wanted to just pick up the phone (The phone)
And tell you, "Ooh baby, baby, I missed your loving so."
But I ain't holding back no more, 'cause your man is coming home
You might also like
And I want you to love me (Like I never left, left)
And I want you to hold me (Like I never left, left)
And I want you to touch me, yeah (Like I never left, left)
Come give me what I'm missing (Like I never left, oh yeah)

I had enough, I miss you bad (Bad)
What I did, leave in the past (Past)
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left (Like I never left)
Oh, said back in the building, back on the block (Block)
You and me together, we back on top (Top)
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop (Stop)
Like I never left
I had enough, I miss you bad (I miss you bad)
What I did, leave in the past (Yeah)
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left, left

(I'm coming back home, boy)
Said back in the building, back on the block
(I'm coming back home, boy)
You and me together, we back on top (Yeah, yeah)
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left
(And I want you to love me) Like I never left
And I want you to hold me
Like I never left (Oh, and I want you to hold me)
And I want you to touch me (Yeah)
Like I never left (Yeah)
Come give me what I'm missing (Oh yeah)
Like I never left, yeah (And I want you to love me)

Oh baby, come love me, come hold me
Come touch me, oh, come give me
Like I never left (I never left you, baby)
Oh baby, come love me, come hold me
Come touch me, oh, come give me
Like I never left (I never left you, baby)Embed
