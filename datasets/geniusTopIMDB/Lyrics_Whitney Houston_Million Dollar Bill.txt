Million Dollar Bill Lyrics
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

Came in the door, checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for is staring in my face, oh
They played our song, we hit the floor, he held me strong
And we danced the night away

I can see the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and round
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "aww, baby"

It's been a long long time
Since I felt that love has found my way, oh, oh, oh
I've been lookin' (Looking)
I've been searchin' (Searching)
For the man to touch this place
Oh, oh, yeah

Canâ€™t deny the way that he's making feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm saying, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill (If he makes you feel)
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "aww, baby"

If you feel good
If you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air
Say, "yeah" (Yeah)
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
It's 'cause love is in the air
Love is in the air (Oh yeah)

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "oh, oh, oh"
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill (If he makes you feel)
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "aww, baby"

Ohh
Oh, if he makes you feel
Oh, if he makes you feel (yeah, yeah)
C'mon and say
C'mon and say
Ohh
Oh, if he makes you feel
Oh, if he makes you feel
