Queen of the Night Lyrics
I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Yeah

Don't make no difference if I'm wrong or I'm right
I've got the feeling and I'm willing tonight
Well I ain't nobody's angel
What can I say
Well I'm just that way
Hey, ey
I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Just say it, say it, say it
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Yeah

You've got a problem with the way that I am
They say I'm trouble and I don't give a damn
But when I'm bad, I know I'm better
I just want to get loose
And turn it up for you, baby

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Just say it, say it again
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah (Oh yeah)

To make you drop to your knees
Cause I'm the queen of the night

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh oh, say it again
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
