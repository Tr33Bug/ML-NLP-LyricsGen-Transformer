Why Does It Hurt So Bad Lyrics
Why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad
Oh it hurts so bad baby
My life's been better
Since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said I would do boy
I found someone who loves me for me yeah yes
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad
Why do I feel so sad
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying
When I don't love you
So why does it hurt so bad
Baby I thought I had let you go
So why does it hurt me so
I gotta get you outta my head
Hurts me so bad
Hurts so (yeah you do)
Hurts so (hurts me so)
Hurts so bad (did you know)
(that it hurts me so) Hurts so
Hurts so (so bad, hey hoh)

"Never again" that's what I said to myself
I never wanna feel your kind of pain again no hey
Just when I think it's over
Just when I think it's through
I find myself right back in love with you

So why does it hurt so bad oh baby
Why do I feel so sad
Thought I, thought I, thought I was over you
I keep crying
When I don't love you
When I really don't love you boy
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no it hurts so bad, oh tell me
(Thought I) Thought I could let you go boy
(You could)
Oh you really hurt me so bad
Gotta get you outta my head
Boy you hurt me so bad
Hurts so (yeah you do)
Hurts so (hurt so)
Hurts so bad (hurts so)
Hurts so
Hurts so (sure you did)
Hurts so (you make me wanna)
Hurts so bad (you make me wanna shoop shoop)
Hurts so (hurt so)
Hurts so (I've gotta shoop now)
Hurts so bad (hey hey hey hey)
Hurts so (Hurt me so)
Hurts so (yeah you did hey)
Oh why, you hurt me so bad
Bad
