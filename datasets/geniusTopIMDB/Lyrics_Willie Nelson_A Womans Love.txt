A Womanâ€™s Love LyricsA woman's love goes deeper than a man's
Into a place only she understands
It's a healing touch, it's a blade of a knife
But it's a woman's love, a woman's love that gives you life
A woman's love is stronger than a man's
But it can hold your heart in the palm of its hands
It'll keep the faith through the long dark night
It takes a woman's love, a woman's love to see the light
It'll make you fly or sink you like a stone
It'll leave you high or leave you all alone
If you believe her word no matter what you've heard
Anybody say about it, there's no life for you without it now
It'll make you fly or sink you like a stone
But it'll leave you high or leave you all alone
If you believe her word no matter what you've heard
Anybody say about it, there's no life for you without it now
If a woman's love ever finds your soul
It'll break your will and take control
Cause the very thing that your heart cries for
Is a woman's love, this woman's love and nothing more
It's a woman love you're living forYou might also likeEmbed
