Ain’t Goin’ Down on Brokeback Mountain LyricsNow I've been up the Chisholm Trail
Been through Death Valley, hot as hell
I rode across the dusty plains
There's cowboy runnin' through my veins
But I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountan
No, I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
Well I've watched the heard from dusk 'til dawn
But I did it with my britches on
You can have a chew, you can bum a smoke
But don't go reachin' for my rope
I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountan
No, I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
(solo)
(Whoa, Willy, that last note sounded a might... queer)
What you do's your business hoss
You can buy me a beer, and then fuck off
But I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountan
No, I ain't goin' down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right (That shit ain't right)
That shit ain't right
(Oh!, what the hell?)
(Oh, that's my saddle horn! - Thank Goodness!)You might also like1Embed
