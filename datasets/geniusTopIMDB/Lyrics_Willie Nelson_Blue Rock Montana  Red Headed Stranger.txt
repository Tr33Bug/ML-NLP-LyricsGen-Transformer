Blue Rock Montana / Red Headed Stranger LyricsWell he rode into Blue Rock, dusty and tired
And he got him a room for the night
He lay there in silence with too much on his mind
Still hoping that he was not right
But he found them that evening at a tavern in town
In a quiet little out-of-the-way place
And they smiled at each other when he walked through the door
And they died with their smiles on their faces
They died with a smile on their face
Don't boss him, don't cross him, he's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and hiding his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him, just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on againYou might also likeEmbed
