Buddy Lyrics
Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

If I ever needed you, buddy
You know now I really do, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

I cry at the least, little thing, buddy
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy
Talk to me, buddy, stay with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get away with it, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

Let's talk about things as they were, buddy
Before I got mixed up with her, buddy

Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonelyYou might also like3Embed
