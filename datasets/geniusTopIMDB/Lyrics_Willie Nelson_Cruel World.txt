Cruel World Lyrics
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone

This big ol' world sure got me running 'round
I heard a voice that said, "Just settle down"
And with the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I am homeward bound
Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone


Desert roads, desert plains
I have seen so much pain
Now I see into the eyes of a girl
No more, no more, cruel world

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone


Dusty trail, saw vapor light
Was it a mirage? I don't know, but it seemed right
I felt mission, I felt trust
I knew then that I must
Must go to her from this cruel world

Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone


Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone4Embed
