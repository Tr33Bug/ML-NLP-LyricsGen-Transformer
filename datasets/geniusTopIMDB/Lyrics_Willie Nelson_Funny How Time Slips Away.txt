Funny How Time Slips Away Lyrics
Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems now that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away?

How's your new love?
I hope that he's doing fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him 'til the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away?
I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you
In time, you're gonna pay
And it's surprising how time slips awayYou might also like2Embed
