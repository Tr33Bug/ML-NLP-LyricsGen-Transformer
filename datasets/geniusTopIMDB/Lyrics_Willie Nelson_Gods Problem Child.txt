Godâ€™s Problem Child Lyrics
I did the best I could do
But the best I could tell
The higher I flew
The farther I fell

Born in the mud
Raised in the wild
Washed in the blood
God's problem child
I feel the shine
Following me
Not far behind
That's where I wanna be
A little out of time
Fine by me

Darkness may fall
We still got a light
Keeping us all
Safe through the night

Heaven must love
God's problem child
Heaven must love
God's problem child
Heaven must love
