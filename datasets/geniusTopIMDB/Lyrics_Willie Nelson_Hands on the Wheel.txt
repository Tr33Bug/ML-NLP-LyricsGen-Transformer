Hands on the Wheel Lyrics
At a time when the world seems to be spinnin'
Hopelessly out of control
There's deceivers, and believers, and old in-betweeners
That seem to have no place to go

Well, it's the same old song, it's right and it's wrong
And living is just something that I do
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you
I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going home

And in the shade of an oak down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Setting sail, spinning tales and fishing for whales
With a lady they both enjoy

Well, it's the same damn tune
It's the man in the moon
It's the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

And I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going homeYou might also likeEmbed
