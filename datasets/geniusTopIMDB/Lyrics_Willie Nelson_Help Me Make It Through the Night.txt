Help Me Make It Through the Night Lyrics
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Playing soft against your skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care if it's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Because tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

I don't care if it's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Because tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

I don't want to be alone
Help me make it through the nightYou might also likeEmbed
