Immigrant Eyes Lyrics
Oh, Ellis Island was swarming
Like a scene from a costume ball
Decked out in the colors of Europe
And on fire with the hope of it all
There my father's own father stood huddled
With the tired and hungry and scared
Turn of the century pilgrims
Bound by the dream that they shared
They were standing in line just like cattle
Poked and sorted and shoved
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom
Some were torn from someone they love
Through this sprawling Tower of Babel
Came a young man, confused and alone
Determined and bound for America
And carrying all that he owned
Sometimes when I looked in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
I saw that day reflected and I couldn't hold my feelings inside
I saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
"So don't take it for granted," said grandfather's immigrant eyes

He would rock and stare out the window
But his eyes are still just as clear
As the day he sailed through the Harbor
And come ashore on that island of tears
My grandfather's days were numbered
But I won't let his memory die
'Cause he gave me the gift of this country
And the look in his immigrant eyes

Sometimes when I looked in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
I saw that day reflected and couldn't hold my feelings inside
I saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
"So don't take it for granted," said grandfather's immigrant eyes
"Don't take it for granted," said grandfather's immigrant eyesYou might also likeEmbed
