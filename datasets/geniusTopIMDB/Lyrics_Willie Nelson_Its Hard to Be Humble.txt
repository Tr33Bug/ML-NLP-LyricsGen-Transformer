Itâ€™s Hard to Be Humble Lyrics
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that I can

I used to have me a girlfriend
But I guess that she couldn't compete
With all of them love-starved women
Who keep clamoring around at my feet
Well I probably could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me (Oh man)
Who cares? I'll never get lonesome
'Cause I treasure my own company
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that we can

I guess you could say I'm a loner (Yeah)
A cowboy outlaw, tough and proud
I could have a lot of friends if I wanted
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm egotistical
Hell, I don't even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the way
That I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans

Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
But I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that we can
Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that I canYou might also likeEmbed
