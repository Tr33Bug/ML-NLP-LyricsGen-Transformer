Iâ€™ve Loved You All Over the World Lyrics
You're my buddy, my pal, my friend
It will be that way until the end
And wherever you go, I want you to know
You're my buddy, my pal, my friend

And I've loved you all over the world
You are my sunshine
You keep my life in a whirl
And you love me sometimes
I'll always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
I'll love you all over the world


I'll always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
I'll love you all over the world
