Just Breathe Lyrics
Yes I understand, that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh I’m a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they’ve got none uh-huh
Stay with me ohh
Let’s just breathe
Practiced on my sins, never gonna let you win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
I don’t want to hurt
There’s so much in this world to make me believe
Stay with me
You're all I see
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh if I didn’t I’m a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean

I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, uh-huh
Nothing you would take, everything you gave

Did I say that I need you? Ohoh
Did I say that I want you?
Oh if I didn’t I’m a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean

Nothing you would take, everything you gave
Love you till I die, meet you on the other sideYou might also likeEmbed
