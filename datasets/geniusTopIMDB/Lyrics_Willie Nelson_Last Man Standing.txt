Last Man Standing LyricsI don't wanna be the last man standin'
Or wait a minute maybe I do
If you don't mind I'll start a new line
And decide after thinkin' it through
Go on in front if you're in such a hurry
Like heaven ain't waitin' for you
I don't wanna be the last man standin'
On second thought maybe I do
It's gettin' hard to watch my pals check out
Cuts like a wore out knife
One thing I learned about runnin' the road
Is forever don't apply to life
Waylon and Ray and Merle and old Norro
Lived just as fast as me
I still got a lotta good friends left
And I wonder who the next will be
I don't wanna be the last man standin'
Or wait a minute maybe I do
If you don't mind I'll start a new line
And decide after thinkin' it through
Go on in front if you're in such a hurry
Like heaven ain't waitin' for you
I don't wanna be the last man standin'
On second thought maybe I do
Maybe we'll all meet again
On the other side
We'll pick and sing
Load up the buses and ride
I don't wanna be the last man standin'
Or wait a minute maybe I do
If you don't mind I'll start a new line
And decide after thinkin' it through
Go on in front if you're in such a hurry
'Cause hell is a-waitin' there too
I don't wanna be the last man standin'
On second thought maybe I do
Yeah maybe I do
Yeah maybe I do
Yeah maybe I doYou might also likeEmbed
