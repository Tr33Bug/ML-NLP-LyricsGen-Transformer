Me and You Lyrics
I turned the sound down on my TV
I just can't listen any more
It's like I'm in some foreign country
That I've never seen before
So come now here to think about it
What in the hell are we goin to do?
Cause after all is said and all is done
It's just me and you
It's just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
There's more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So it's just me and you
It's just me and you

I had a friend I used to talk to
We used to both sit on the fence
But anymore I can't relate to him
'Cause he ain't got a lick of sense
So now I just ask you the questions
But I'm the one I'm talkin' to
The world has gone out of its mind
Except for me and you

It's just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
There's more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So it's just me and you
It's just me and you
Yeah it's just me and youYou might also likeEmbed
