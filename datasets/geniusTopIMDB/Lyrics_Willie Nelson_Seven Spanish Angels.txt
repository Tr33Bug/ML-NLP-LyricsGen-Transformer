Seven Spanish Angels Lyrics
He looked down into her brown eyes
And said "Say a prayer for me"
She threw her arms around him
Whispered "God will keep us free"
They could hear the riders coming
He said "This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive"

There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home
She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, "Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man"
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

There were seven Spanish angels
At the alter of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped
And the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home

Come on Willie, help me with this thing

There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun (Oh I believe)
They were praying for the lovers (Yeah they was)
In the Valley of the Gun (Well, well, well)
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne (Oh, yeah)
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel homeEmbed
