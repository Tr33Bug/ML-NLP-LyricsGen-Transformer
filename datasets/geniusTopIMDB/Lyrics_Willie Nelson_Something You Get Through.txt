Something You Get Through LyricsWhen you lose the one you love
You think your world has ended
You think your world will be a waste of life
Without them in it
You feel there's no way to go on
Life is just a sad, sad song
But love is bigger than us all
The end is not the end at all
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not ours to be taken
It's just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when it's gone
It lives in someone new
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get through
It's not somethin' you get over
But it's somethin' you get throughYou might also likeEmbed
