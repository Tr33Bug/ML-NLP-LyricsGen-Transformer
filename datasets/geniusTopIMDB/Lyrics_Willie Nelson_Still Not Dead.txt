Still Not Dead LyricsI woke up still not dead again today
The internet said I had passed away
If I died I wasn't dead to stay
And I woke up still not dead again today
Well, I woke up still not dead again today
The gardener did not find me that a way
You can't believe a word that people say
And I woke up still not dead again today
I run up and down the road making music as I go
They say my pace would kill a normal man
But I've never been accused of being normal anyway
And I woke up still not dead again today
I woke up still not dead again today
The news said I was gone to my dismay
Don't bury me, I've got a show to play
And I woke up still not dead again today
I run up and down the road making music as I go
They say my pace would kill a normal man
But I've never been accused of being normal anyway
And I woke up still not dead again today
Last night I had a dream that I died twice yesterday
But I woke up still not dead again todayYou might also likeEmbed
