Ten with a Two Lyrics
Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light, I lost my eyesight
I ain't been that drunk in awhile
Along about one I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two

Well I made up my mind I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape that I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sittin' at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a ten

Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
You might also like
Now you may laugh
But if you've got the cash
I'll bet you ten to one you have tooEmbed
