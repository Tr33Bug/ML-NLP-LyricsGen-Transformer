The Partyâ€™s Over Lyrics
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

What a crazy, crazy party, never seen so many people
Laughing, dancing, look at you, you're having fun
But look at me I'm almost crying
But that don't keep her love from dying
Misery, 'cause for me the party's over
Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

Once I had a love undying, I didn't keep it wasn't trying
Life for me was just one party and then another
I broke her heart so many times, had to have my party wife
And then one night she said, "Sweetheart, the party's over"

Turn out the lights, the party's over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night, the party's over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again

And tomorrow starts the same old thing againYou might also like1Embed
