Vote â€™Em Out Lyrics
If you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
That's what Election Day is all about
The biggest gun we've got
Is called "the ballot box"
So if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out

Vote 'em out (Vote 'em out)
Vote 'em out (Vote 'em out)
And when they're gone, we'll sing and dance and shout
Bring some new ones in
And we'll start that show again
And if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
If it's a bunch of clowns you voted in
Election Day is comin' 'round again
If you don't like it now
If it's more than you'll allow
If you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out

Vote 'em out (Vote 'em out)
Vote 'em out (Vote 'em out)
And when they're gone, we'll sing and dance and shout
Bring some new ones in
And we'll start the show again
And if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out

Vote 'em out (Vote 'em out)
Vote 'em out (Vote 'em out)
That's what Election Day is all about
The biggest gun we've got
Is called "the ballot box"
So if you don't like who's in there, vote 'em out
If you don't like who's in there, well, vote 'em outYou might also likeEmbed
