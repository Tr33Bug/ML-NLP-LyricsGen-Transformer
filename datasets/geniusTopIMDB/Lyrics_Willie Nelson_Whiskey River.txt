Whiskey River Lyrics
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my mem'ried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold

Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my mem'ried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold

Whiskey River take my mind (take my mind)
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
