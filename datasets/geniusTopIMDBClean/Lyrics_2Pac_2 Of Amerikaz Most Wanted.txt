Up out of there
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Eh light that up Snoop Why you actin like that
Ahh shit you done fucked up now
Aint nothin but a gangsta party 
You done put two of Americas most wanted
In the same motherfuckin place at the same motherfuckin time
Aint nothin but a gangsta party 
Ha ha ha ha yall niggas about to feel this
Aint nothin but a gangsta party 
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin condoms
Have one on us aight
Aint nothin but a gangsta party 
A toast to the gangsters
Picture perfect I paint a perfect picture
Bombin hoochies with precision my intentions to get richer
With the SN doubleOP Dogg my fuckin homie
Yous a coldass nigga on them hogs
Sho nuff I keep my hand on my gun
Cause they got me on the run
Now Im back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free 2Pac is all thats on a niggas mind
But at the same time it seems they tryin to take mine
So Ima get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionaire motherfuckers catchin cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down the shits about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
Im losin my religion Im vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game but you got the rules missin
Niggas be actin like they savage they out to get the cabbage
Ive got nothin but love for my niggas livin lavish
Ive got a pit named Petey she Nigerino
Ive got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think Ive got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you babybubba
You see this is for the Gs and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin for years so how can they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these motherfuckin Gs
If you got it better flaunt it
Another warrant 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Nothin but a gangsta party 
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Nothin but a gangsta party
It aint nothin but a motherfuckin gangsta party 
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Nothin but a gangsta party
It aint nothin but a motherfuckin gangsta party 
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Now give me fifty feet defeat is not my destiny
Release me to the streets and keep whatevers left of me
Jealousy is misery suffery is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy what
There aint no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the thug
You thought it was but it wasnt now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
Its like Cuh Blood gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin dopeslangin
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin your job every day
And then you work so hard til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you bout life and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun so we die by the guns kid
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throwaway
Floatin in the black Benz  Bitch  tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and doughrelated
Affiliated with the hustlers so we made it
No answers to questions Im tryin to get up on it
My nigga Dogg and me eternally the most wanted
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Nothin but a gangsta party
It aint nothin but a motherfuckin gangsta party 
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Nothin but a gangsta party
It aint nothin but a motherfuckin gangsta party 
Aint nothin but a gangsta party
Nothin but a gangsta party
