Against all odds up in the studio gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21gun salute dressed in fatigues black jeans and boots
I just appeared in the crowd all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talking bout he left the hospital took five like me
You live in fantasies nigga I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed em out
Next time grown folks talking nigga close your mouth
Peep me I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein a thug
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know whats goin on

Witness me strapped with MACs knew I wouldnt play that
All you old rappers tryin to advance

Jewelry fast cars and hes known for flashin
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin for the feds
Same crime different trials nigga picture what he said
And did I mention
Promised to payback Jimmy Henchman in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin the world is mine
Set me up wet me up niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine on everything I love
Ill destroy everything you touch

This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds up in the studio gettin blowed

Puffy gettin bribed like a bitch to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldnt have did so we ridin for that
And that nigga that was down for me restin dead
Switched sides guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real be a legend breathin or dead
Lord listen to me God dont like ugly it was written

You heard my melody  This nigga sounds like Rakim 
Read about my life in the papers
