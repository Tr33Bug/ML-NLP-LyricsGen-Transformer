Ah yeah Hahaha  Yeah 
Its all about you one time  Ima say its all about you baby yeah 
Haha for the bitches that think its all about you  Its all about you   This Dru Down in the house
With my boy Pizznac you know what Im sayin 
Its all about you  Yeah Im gon say its all about you
But you know Im lyin though ha Yeah 
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh at how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
Its just my luck Im stuck with fuckin with the wrong one
Wise decisions based on lies we livin
Scandalous times this games like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub lookin for some love
In every club I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
Im still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you aint impressed with the money Im makin
Guess its true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail lifes hell for a black celebrity
So thats the reason why I call and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin can I hit it  Hell no 
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what Im sayin boo cause this is all about you
Every other city we go every other video  Its all about you 
No matter where I go I see the same hoes  Its all about you 
Every other city we go every other video  Its all about you 
No matter where I go I see the same hoes
I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know Ill have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me Im a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her Im a playa and I dont even care
Creep though weed smokes in the air
Everywhere I go its all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friends video
Could never put a bitch before my friends so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that Im goin through
Its all about you
Yeah nigga its all about you
Every other city we go every other video  Its all about you 
No matter where I go I see the same hoes
Every other city we go every other video  Its all about you 
No matter where I go I see the same hoes
Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu
It aint about you or your bitchass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think its all about you Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas too
You couldnt hold me back itd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack perhaps it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode em swoll
Straight in control flowsll fold while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set I told Dramacy go in next
Gold diggin cold diggin a gold Rolex
I slide in easily try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut I came to fuck try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
Its all about you 
Every other city we go every other video  Its all about you 
No matter where I go I see the same hoes
Every other city we go every other video  Its all about you 
No matter where I go I see the same hoes
Every other city we go every other video  Its all about you 
No matter where I go I see the same hoes
Every other city we go every other video
No matter where I go I see the same hoes
Im tellin ya its the same old shit
I mean goddamn you know what Im sayin
Im sittin back watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel Im checkin out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what Im sayin And then you know what Im sayin
What make that even more fucked up
Im watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean damn everywhere I look everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Dont get mad Im only bein real yeah
