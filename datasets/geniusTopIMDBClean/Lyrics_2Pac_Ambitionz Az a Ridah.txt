That get down for theirs
Constantly money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin without guard
Was born rough and rugged addressin the mass public  Hahaha 
My attitude was fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated only what you make it to be
And   Uh and my ambitions as a ridah  Excuse me baby 
To catch her while she hot and horny go up inside her  Got ya 
Then I spit some game in her ear Go to the telly ho
Equipped with money in a Benz cause bitch Im barely broke  Hahaha

From player to player the games tight the feelings mutual
From hustlin and prayers to breakin motherfuckers to pay us

Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin  Booyah

Stay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear been away for years  Im back baby 
Now Im back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds sure as some bitches bleed
Niggasll feel the fire of my mothers corrupted seed
Buckbuckbuckbuckbuck  Blast me but they didnt finish didnt diminish
My powers so now Im back to be a motherfuckin menace  Them niggas cowards 
They cowards thats why they tried to set me up
Had bitchass niggas  Bitchass niggas  on my team so indeed they wet me up  Punk niggas 
But Im back reincarnated incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics thats legendary musical mercenary
For money Ill have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin much mail in jail niggas tellin me to kill it  Hahaha 
Knowin when I get out they gon feel it  Yeah right 
Witness the realest a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her must remind ya
