God has a plan and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior
And that Christ is returning someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
For my life and your life
As long as were cooperating with God
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
Well see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy
2Pac dont start that blasphemy in here
Makaveli the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word follow me
Remember what my pops told me
My family tree consists of drug dealers thugs and killers
Strugglin known to hustle screamin fuck they feelings
I got advice from my father all he told me was this
Nigga get off your ass if you plan to be rich
Theres ten rules to the game but Ill share with you two
Know niggas gon hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one get your cash on MOB
Thats Money Over Bitches cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close nigga watch your homies
It seemed a little unimportant when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels bein handed to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime Id live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw studyin rules
Now papa aint around so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein written on my enemys walls
Promised if I have a seed Ima guide him right
Dear Lord dont let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades listen and learn
Aint nothin free get back what you earned
No doubt gettin higher than a motherfucka bless me please
This Thug Lifell be the death of me
Cmon yeah


And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy
Nuf for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud
Remember what my pops told me 
Using the name of the lord in vain
blasblasblasphemy blasphemy 
Remember what my pops told me 
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
We proly in Hell already our dumb asses not knowin
Everybody kissin ass to go to Heaven aint goin
Put my soul on it Im fightin devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifyin brothers severely
Tell me I aint Gods son nigga momma a virgin
We got evicted had to leave the burbs
Back in the ghetto doin wild shit
Lookin at the sun dont pay
Criminal mind all the time wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up deadly
Babylon beware comin for the Pharoahs kids
Retaliation makin legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin niggas in Jerusalem waitin for signs
God comin shes just takin her time  haha 
Livin by the Nile while the water flow
Im contemplatin plots wonderin where the thoughtll go
Brothas gettin shot comin back resurrected
Its just that raw shit nigga check it  that raw shit 
And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me
Blasphemy
Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holding a bird in a cloud
Remember what my pops told me 
Using the name of the lord in vain
Remember what my pops told me 
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
What 
The preacher want me buried why Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead Thats eternal fire
Why you got these kids minds thinkin that they evil
While the preacher bein freaky you say honor Gods people
Should we cry when the Pope die My request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong Is God just another cop
Waitin to beat my ass if I dont go pop
Memories of a past time givin up cash to the leaders
Knowin damn well they aint gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain time in BC
Its hard enough to live now in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation do what you gotta do
But know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door And my people say
Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holding a bird in a cloud
Remember what my pops told me 
Using the name of the lord in vain
Cant I remember what my poppa told me blasphemy 
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
Our Father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come Thy will be done
In Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debtors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For Gods is the kingdom and the power
And the glory forever and ever and ever
