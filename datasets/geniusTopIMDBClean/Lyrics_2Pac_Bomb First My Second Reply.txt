Bomb First  My Second Reply  Lyrics
In todays music news the evercontroversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias Makaveli Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well Nas the alleged ring leader is furious at 2Pacs  excuse me  Makavelis verbal assault on Mobb Sleep Notorious PIG and several other New York rappers JAYZ from Hawaiian Sophie fame Big Little whatever and several other cornysounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release The question everybody wants to know is whyd they get this nigga started 2Pac  rather Makaveli  was not available for comment but released this statement
Its not about East or West
Its about niggas and bitches
Power and money ridaz and punks
Which side are you on
Heartbeat Gunshots
Encroaching footsteps
These niggas is still fuckin talkin
You niggas still breathin Fuckin roaches
Aight its the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers this is it  Makaveli The Don 
Killuminati Style  all day   up in your ass 
Bomb first   Outlaw Ridahz  Solo shit bring it
Allow me to introduce first Makaveli the Don
Hysterical spiritual lyrics like The Holy Quran
Niggas get shook like 50
My 45 is next to me when we ride for survival
Moneymakin plans pistol close at hand swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breed freely
See me rise located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think Im tougher than Nitti my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiends titty  huh  in every city
Youll find me look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me know I mean
I hit the scene niggas duckin from my guillotine stare
Im right there my every word a fuckin nightmare
Get me high let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yall
Extreme venom no mercy when we all up in em
Cut em down to Hell is where we send em
My whole team trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and Im not gonna cry
Me a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits I call them my bitchnigga eaters
And not a whimper until Im gone
Thug Life runnin through my veins so Im strong
Bye bye bye lets get high and ride
Oh how do we do these niggas but Im not gonna cry
Im a Bad Boy killer JAYZ die too
Lookin out for Mobb Deep nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers dont deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me Yayyay
West Coast rider comin right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money hoes sex and weed
I wont rest until my road dogs free  bomb first


We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider fore you die
We aint even come to hurt nobody tonight
But its my life or your life and Ima bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider fore you die
We aint even come to fight tonight
But its my life or your life and Ima bomb first
For so many days in so many ways weve been duckin strays
They delivers but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin to lose I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz its Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission sent to do what youll never do
And thats ride for the cause yes Ill die for the cause
You best believe if Ima leave this bitch yo Im dyin with yours
Kamikaze sicker than a mafuckin Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made Paparazzi
If you aint in this rap game for the motherfuckin cash mane
Then what is your motherfuckin purpose Narcing service
EDI Mean born worthless
Thats until the day I decided to bomb first bitch
Biatch Come on bring it down with it
Then we ride
Come on bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey get that nigga
Your style wack as ever like you was rockin patent leather
Causin massive terror yall niggas lack you aint thorough
Half rapper half drug kingpin youre tellin fairy tales dunn
King of New York like you the motherfuckin one
But Im from Jers we dont play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks all my niggas flippin chips
Gettin rich even though its hard
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs cause yo my man took five
Now Im the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time
Shoot first look at their head burst bleeding
Dont want to hear no shit this evening believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider fore you die
Gs and thug niggas on the rise
Plan plot strategize but bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider fore you die
Gs and thug niggas on the rise
Plan plot strategize and bomb first
Let us pray my nigga
Cause we definitely have sinned
