Brendas got a baby
Brendas got a baby
I hear Brendas got a baby but Brendas barely got a brain
A damn shame the girl can hardly spell her name
Thats not our problem thats up to Brendas family
Well let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie puttin death into his arms
Its sad cause I bet Brenda doesnt even know
Just cause youre in the ghetto doesnt mean you cant grow
But oh thats a thought my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who really didnt care to see or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas bellys gettin bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
Shes twelve years old and shes havin a baby
In love with a molester whos sexin her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that hell be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
She didnt know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
She didnt realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the babys in the trash heap bawlin
Mama cant help her but it hurts to hear her callin
Brenda wants to run away
Mama say You makin me lose pay
Theres social workers here every day
Now Brendas gotta make her own way
Cant go to her family they wont let her stay
No money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin robbed
So now whats next It aint nothin left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
Its payin the rent so she really cant complain
Prostitute found slain and Brendas her name
Shes got a baby
