California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of LA
In the city of good ol Watts
In the city the city of Compton
We keep it rockin we keep it rockin
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state thats untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bombass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean moneymakingmachines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin Sassoon
Now its 95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
Its all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin it down for California
California knows how to party
California knows how to party  Yes they do 
In the city of LA
In the city of good ol Watts
In the city the city of Compton
We keep it rockin we keep it rockin


Shake shake it baby
Shake shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it
Out on bail fresh out of jail California dreamin
Soon as I step on the scene Im hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In LA we wearin Chucks not Ballys  Yeah thats right 
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam
Its Westside so you know the Row wont bow down to no man
Say what you say but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of LA
From Oakland to Sactown the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down give me love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party  Yes they do 
In the city of LA
In the city of good ol Watts
In the city the city of Compton
We keep it rockin we keep it rockin
