Whassup Its 2Pac Can you get away
Let me come swoop you up
You know I got a man 
I know you got a man but he aint gon mind if I take you out
Of course he gon mind 
Let me take you to lunch Ill have you back before he even get home before anybody see

Aww cmon Pleeeeeease
Nah 
Oh aight  whats wrong with your eye
Why you got on glasses
Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
Its like your man dont understand all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Aint bout no suckin and touchin just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations  would that be OK
I dont wanna take up all your time be the next in line
Tell me your size let me find you things with you in mind
I can see youre cautious and Im careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin
Got you shakin when Im standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared just ask the man in the mirror
Now the pictures gettin clearer
All he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him and you tell me keep my faith in God
I dont understand I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you dont deserve it
I contemplate  but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away
Ebony can you get away
Cmon Lets go Can you get away
Can you get away
So much pressure in the air  I know I know 
And I cant get away  Just for a little while love 
Im not happy here  I know its hard but can you get away 
So much pressure in the air
Lets go man get up outta there can you get away 
And I cant get away  Do you love him 
Im not happy here  Do you love that man 
Could it be my destiny to be lonely
Aint checkin for these hoochies that be on me
Cause they phony
But you was different I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
Im sittin here hopin that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when its my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he aint lookin
Now your hearts tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Come see tomorrow
Hopin I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care  that someones there for your struggle
Depend on me when you have needs or theres trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before no time to waste
We can hook up at the store Can you get away
So much pressure in the air  I know it is 
And I cant get away  Yeah you can 
Im not happy here  You aint happy huh Can you get away 
So much pressure in the air  I know is he beatin on you 
And I cant get away  Did he punch you 
Im not happy here  Throwin you around the house 
I sit here reminiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny no longer lonely
Cause now its on for you and me all I can see
A happy home  thats my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do Dont wanna lose you to this sucker
Cause if he touch ya I got some drama for that busta
Dont wanna rush ya but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows on who controls will it last
Before I ask I hope you see that Im sincere
And even if you stay with him today Im still here
I refuse to give up cause I believe in what we share
Youre livin in prison and what hes givin cant compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and Ill never let you go
Tell me can you get away
So much pressure in the air  Cant get away why 
And I cant get away
Im not happy here
Let me take you away all I wanna know can you get away 
So much pressure in the air  Man 
And I cant get away  Course you can get away 
Im not happy here
If you really wanted to get away you could get away 
You aint got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man ya know what Im sayin
I aint tryin to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need but now he aint even takin care of you
He beatin on you and shit look how you look
You too motherfuckin raw to be with that nigga
Ya know what Im sayin
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
Ya know what Im sayin You need to be on first class
Need to be goin to Hawaii seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin to ya know what Im sayin
The emergency room gettin stitches
Cause this nigga done got jealous Dont cry its all good
