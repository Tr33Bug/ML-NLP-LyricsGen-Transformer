The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin hard but wont realize
That they will never see the P
You must be goin blind
Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickelplated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire now them niggas bleedin
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West dont get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe Nigga you aint know
They got me stressed out on Death Row
Ive seen money but baby Ive gots to get mo
You screamin Go 2Pac and I aint stoppin till Im wellpaid
Bails paid now nigga look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise until I die
Ask me why Im a boss player gettin high
And when Im rollin by niggas cant see me
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And youll never realize
You cant see me
Been gettin word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin they can get with us but picture me gettin served
My own mama say Im thugged out
My shit be poppin out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what It aint nothin but a party when we thug
And there I was a young nigga with heart aint had shit to lose
Pullin my pistol on them fools you know the rules
DRE you got me heated my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin bitches where its most needed
Money and weed Aliz and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down witness me
Bail on these hoes in flossmode
The life of a boss player fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets niggas cant see me
Niggas cant see me
They cant see me
Which way did he go George
Which way did he go
Oh Which way did he go
Which way did he go
You niggas made a mistake
You shouldve never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and its judgement day
Hey homie if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed they aint kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake rattle and roll
Im full of liquor thug nigga quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a niggas aim is
Im just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin bring me money then Im rappin till Im paid
Im gettin green like Im supposed to
Nigga I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me player I gotta stay true
Dont be a dumb motherfucker cause its crazy after dark
Where the true thugniggas see your heart niggas cant see me
Yo check this out stay off his dick
Niggas cant see me
Right before your eyes Ill disappear from here
You niggas cant see me
You cant see me
I know its hard nigga Im all up in your face
But you still cant see me
You cant see me
All up in your range but niggas cant see me
2020 vision wont visualize
Im in the flesh baby but you cant see me
All those glasses wont help you realize
You blinded you blinded you cant see me
You cant see me
Thug Life baby
Dont believe everything you read Aliz and weed
You cant see me right before your very eyes
You wont even visualize you cant see me
Dr Dre all day 2Pac
Niggas cant see me
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers
This ones for you BIG baby
Cause you bitchass niggas cant see me
Niggas cant see me
You cant see me
See no evil hear no evil speak no evil
You wont see me
Yeah first you see me now you dont
Wanna see me but you wont
Come to see me but you cant
Oh you cant see me
You cant see me
Right between your eyes and youll never realize
Right before your eyes you wont even realize
Visualize what you cant see
