You are appreciated
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face
Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And whod think in elementary hey
Id see the penitentiary one day
And runnin from the police thats right
Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend Mama
You always was a black queen Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it aint easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare tell me how you did it
Theres no way I can pay you back but the plan
Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont you know we love ya  Dear Mama 
Sweet lady place no one above ya  You are appreciated 
Sweet lady dont you know we love ya
Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and I didnt cry
Cause my anger wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hotplate
You just workin with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough youre alone
Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan
Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated


Lady dont you know we love ya  Dear Mama 
Sweet lady place no one above ya  You are appreciated 
Sweet lady dont you know we love ya
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
Its a struggle every day gotta roll on
And theres no way I can pay you back but my plan
Is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont you know we love ya  Dear Mama 
Sweet lady place no one above ya  You are appreciated 
Sweet lady dont you know we love ya  Dear Mama 
Sweet lady lady  Dear Mama 
Lady lady
