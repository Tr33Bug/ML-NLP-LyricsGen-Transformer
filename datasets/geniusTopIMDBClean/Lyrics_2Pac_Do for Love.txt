Turn it up loud
Hahaha ahahaha hey man
You a little sucker for love Pac
Word up hahahahaha
I shouldve seen
You was trouble right from the start taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it and now
The arguments are gettin loud I wanna stay
But I cant help from walkin out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasnt me
But now Im searchin for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm dont be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be youre killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambitions to be free
I cant breathe cause soon as I leave its like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back Im a sucka for love
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
Just when I thought I broke away and Im feelin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Dont wanna fall for it but in this case what could I do So now Im back
To makin promises to you tryin to keep it true
What if Im wrong a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin to be strong and in the process keep you goin
Im bout to lose my composure Im gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head Im feelin low losin control
My heart is sayin leave oh what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive and now
You gettin calls at the house guess you cheatin
Thats all I need to hear cause Im leavin Im out the door
Never no more will you see me this is the end
Cause now I know youve been cheatin Im a sucka for love
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
Now he left you with scars tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray hoping the beatingsll go away
It wasnt always a hitandrun relationship
It used to be love happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shouldve seen you was trouble but I was lost trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it you told me
Dont worry bout it we can do it now Im under pressure
Make a decision cause Im waitin when Im alone
Im on the phone havin secret conversations huh
I wanna take your misery replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me Im a sucka for love
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do  Do for love 
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do  Do for love 
You tried everything but you dont give up
Do for love yeah baby yeah
