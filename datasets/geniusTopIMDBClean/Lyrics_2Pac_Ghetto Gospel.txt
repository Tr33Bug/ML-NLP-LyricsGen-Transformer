Uh hit em with a little ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me  My ghetto gospel 
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
If I could recollect before my hood days
Id sit and reminisce thinkin of bliss and the good days  Days 
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to em they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyones ashamed of the youth cause the truth look strange
And for me its reversed
We left em a world thats cursed and it hurts  Hurts 
Cause any day theyll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin
Dont it make you get teary The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
Theres no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me maybe you can learn to cheer me
It aint about black or white cause we human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
My ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me  Ghetto gospel 
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Tell me do you see that old lady aint it sad
Livin out a bag but shes glad for the little things she has
And over there theres a lady
Crack got her crazy guess whos givin birth to a baby
I dont trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back will I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals take control drink out my own bottles  Own bottles 
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when its said and done I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you dont stress
Never forget that God isnt finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me  Yeah ghetto gospel 
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Lord can you hear me speak
To pay the price of bein hellbound
