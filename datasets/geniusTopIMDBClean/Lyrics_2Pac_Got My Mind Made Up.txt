You find a MC like me whos strong
Leavin motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda Im all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain
That make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck yo brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizin who the fuck we are
When I penetrate its been withstandin faded
Would it be the greatest MC of alltime When I created rhyme
For the simple fact when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride every time all night
Im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard Im faced what Ima ride
Breakin in gas with a 68 all day
Inandout with my pay assume to count the bodies
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you could be more familiar with the nigga you facin
We must be patient nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin no more procrastination
Give up to fate and get that ass shakin
Im bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Dont take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
Its similar to Rhythm Nation but thugged out forgive me Janet
Whos in control Im activatin your souls
You know the way the games gettin told
Yo two years ago a friend of mine
Told me Aliz and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat clearin my throat
I got my mind made up come on  Come on 
Get in get into it  Get on it 
Let it ride  Get with it  tonights the night
I got my mind made up come on
Get in get into it  To it 
Let it ride tonights the night
Well I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylacs
For protection so my fuckin sack wont collapse  Uh 
Cause nowadays shits evadin the Xrays
Sendin young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin tactics of torturin MCs
Shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin like thunder Im just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
Im an MC with lyrics thats the fuckin Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymesll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
Theres no escape nah I aint blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin
Opposed to laughin raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin
Why is that Cause smilin faces deceive
You best believe to MCs Im the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camps under siege and Im Jason Voorhees  Uh 
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocab on site
Im out the cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall  Yeah 
Should already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator  Equation 
I rock from here to there to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
Fuck you losers
While you fake jacks I make maneuvers
Like Hitler stickin up  with German 
The mister MethTical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message dont touch the dial  Yeah 
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blaow
Melons get swellings I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my clans repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for ninenickels
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then testicles
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Headbanger boogie catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight you cant pull me
Better take one and pass or thats that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast
Ayo lyrical gat spittin the criminal tactics
Nonbelievers get my dick and genital backwards
Lets face it theres no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit Im laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when Im splifted
Funk Doctor who Spock bitch dont get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs cant fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust til every nigga here drop men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
Im dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like kis
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it Im the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shakyass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoke
Choke off this antidote got you hope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee 45 Colt
And Im out for ninenickel 
INS the Rebel
Wist bliss this
Sis bliss
