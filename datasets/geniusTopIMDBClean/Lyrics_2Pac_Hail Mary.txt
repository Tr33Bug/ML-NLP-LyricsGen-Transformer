Makaveli in this Killuminati
All through your body  All through your body 
The blow is like a 12Gauge shotty  Uh  feel me
Come with me Hail Mary nigga run quick see 
And God said he should send his one begotten son
What do we have here now Do you wanna ride or die 
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me  La ladala la la la la 
Eat my flesh flesh of my flesh
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La ladala la la la la
I aint a killer but dont push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded wise words bein quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down pray to God hopin that hes listenin
Seein niggas comin for me through my diamonds when they glistenin
Now pay attention bless me please Father Im a ghost
In these killing fields Hail Mary catch me if I go
Lets go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark evil lurks enemies see me flee
Activate my hate let it break to the flame
Set trip empty out my clip never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they cant adjust its just as well Hail Mary
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La dada da da dada da
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La dada da da dada da


Penitentiaries is packed with promisemakers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin
Institutionalized I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile were too crazy to be humble
We ballin catch me Father please
Cause Im fallin in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy I hear you callin can I get some more
Hell til I reach Hell I aint scared
Mama checkin in my bedroom I aint there
I got a head with no screws in it what can I do
One life to live but I got nothin to lose
Just me and you on a oneway trip to prison sellin drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights Ill be there in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary nigga
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La dada da da dada da
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La dada da da dada da
They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now walk around halfdead
Head down Kblasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in now Im twisted blistered and high
Visions of me thuglivin gettin me by
Forever live and I multiply survived by thugs
When I die they wont cry unless they comin with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatevers goin on around me
Brain kind of cloudy smoked out feelin rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin in a stolen Black Ac Integra
Cocked back sixty seconds til the draw thats when Im deadin ya
Feet first youve got a nice Gat but my heats worse
From a thug to preachin church
I gave you love now you eatin dirt
Needin work and I aint the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond
When I was broke I had to hustle til dawn
Thats when the sun came up theres only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas get your pay and weight up
If its on then its on we rape beatbreaks
Outlawz on a paper chase can you relate
To this shit I dont got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate hopin God dont close the gate
If its on then its on we rape beatbreaks
Outlawz on a paper chase can you relate
To this shit I dont got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate hopin God dont close the gate
Come with me
Hail Mary nigga run quick see
What do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
Weve been travelin on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary hail Mary  Hail Mary 
We wont worry everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We wont worry everything will curry
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary hail Mary
