Hey Suge what I tell you nigga
When I come out of jail what I was gonna do
I was gonna start diggin into these niggas chest right
Heh watch this
Hey Quik let me see them binoculars nigga the binoculars
Hahahahaha Yeah nigga time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
Cause its gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik finna show you niggas
What its like on this sidethe real side
Now on this ride theres gonna be some real motherfuckers
And theres gonna be some pussies
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize
Cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say theyre your friends but in real life they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be snitches
Its a dirty game yall
Yall gotta be careful about who you fuck with
And who you dont fuck with cause the shit get wild yall
Keep your mind on your riches baby
Keep your mind on your riches
911 its an emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the burbs every one of you niggas heard of me
Shit Im legendary niggas scaried and paralyzed
Nothin more I despise than a liar cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker why these devils left me free
I proceed to make em shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a worldwide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr Makaveli
Niggas is waitin for some thug shit thats what they tell me
So many rumors but Im infinite Immortal Outlaw
Switchin up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment Im deceased
Will be another moment ballin as a G
I rip the crowd then I start again eternally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The hearts of men
No heart for the fightin
I was in every gang they had about five I was in all of em
Whichever one was winning Thats my side
The hearts of men
Cause I wasnt fightin shit
Nigga made me unball my fists once show you how scared I was
I had my fists up ready he said Muthafucka put your hands down
My lyrical verge with so much pain to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust if you aint one of us it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
Im a homicidal outlaw and fiveo
Get your lights on the fights on
Tonights gonna be a fuckin fight so we might roll
My own homies say Im heartless
But Im a G in this until the day Im gone thats regardless
Ride by niggas bow down thought Id rot in jail
Paid bail well a niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up first nigga gettin drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number then start again
Dont have no motherfuckin friends
Nigga look inside the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
To all my niggas engaged in makin money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin in fear my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like Im the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin problems open fire and bomb
I died and came back I hustle with these lyrics
As if its a game of crack thuggin is in my spirit
Im lost and not knowin
Scarred up but still flowin energized and still goin
Uhh can it be fate that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealousass cowards cause they evil and fake
What will it take Give me that bass line Im feelin bomb
Death Row baby dont be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent cause Ive been sent the hearts of men
