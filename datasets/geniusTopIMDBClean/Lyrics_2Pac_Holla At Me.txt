Are you confused
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes
Of a nigga who dont have a thing to lose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
How could you do me like that I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape its a fools fate
Without your word youre a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga we can never be friends
I know Im runnin through your head now
What could you do If it was up to you Id be dead now
I let the world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live until you die

Curious spittin lyrics on the verge of furious
Im addicted to currency nigga thats why we doin this
I got shot up I surprised the niggas the way I got up
And then I hit the studio its time to blow the block up
No hesitation this information got you contemplatin
Heartbreakin and eliminatin with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
Its a celebration of my criminal elevation more participation
I want members across the fifty states
We keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Will I be great is it my fate to live the life of luxury
Some niggas bought my tapes so much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared cause only the strong survive life isnt fair  fair 
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you see come fuck with me I give that ass a try
Nigga holla at me
Gotta be careful cant let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
And now I gotta be careful cant let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
I shouldve saw the signs I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
Its a shame so much pressure on my brain
Why she blame me
Secrets in the dark only her and I know
Now Im sittin in the state pen doin time slow
Guess she made a bad decision that got me livin
Just like an animal Im caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin cause hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
A cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin
Picture my prophecy I got some attacking me on top of me
Im runnin from the coppers but never let em stop me
Cause Im a soldier hell ever since I was a little nigga
Havin fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid trust a nono
Love is a mystery fuck the popo
Holla at me
So when you see me nigga you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Gotta be careful cant let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga you better holla at me
