Change shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of yall niggas to get up out the hood
Shit Im wit ya I aint mad at cha
Got nothin but love for ya do your thing boy
Yeah all the homies that I aint talk to in a while
Ima send this one out for yall
Know what I mean Cause I aint mad at cha
Heard yall tearin up shit out there
Kickin up dust givin a motherfuck
Yeah niggas cause I aint mad at cha
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to YA and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a Jheri curl didnt quite learn
On the block witcha Glock trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the crib sayin how youve changed
Oh you a Muslim now No more dope game
Heard you might be comin home just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque dont wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie hes a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you Im livin large you tell me its trouble
Congratulations on the weddin I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life and thats no bullshittin
I know we grew apart you probably dont remember
I used to fiend for your sister but never went up in her
And I can see us after school wed bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shits changed and we dont even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you aint even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when its time to roll you got a brothers back
And I cant even trip cause Im just laughin at cha
You tryin hard to maintain then go ahead
Cause I aint mad at cha


I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
We used to be like distant cousins fightin playin dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin knowin that we wasnt
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
Im gettin blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin and grindin wasnt nothin on our mind
In time wed learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated you said that youd wait
Dont give nobody no coochie while Ill be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said Ill return but I gotta fight the fates arrived
Dont shed a tear cause mama I aint happy here
I blew trial no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin mad Im knockin busters on they backs
In my cell thinkin Hell I know one day Ill be back
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl Id be there so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it but Im just laughin at cha
Cause yous a downass bitch and I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
A true downass bitch and I aint mad at cha
Well guess whos movin up This niggas ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it hookers keep fallin down
He went from nothin to lots ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
Hes Mr LocalCelebrity addicted to movin kis
Most hated by enemies escape in the luxury
See first you was our nigga but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it to the better days
Cause crime pays and in time youll find a rhymell blaze
Youll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head when will it stop
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as an adolescent I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if Im still down
I moved up out of the ghetto so I aint real now
They got so much to say but Im just laughin at cha
You niggas just dont know but I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
Hell nah I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
And I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
