Round and round  Aw yeah 
Round and round round we go  I get around 
Round and round
Still clown with the Underground when we come around
Step up stepstep up step up 
Round and round round we go  stronger than ever 
Round and round
Back to get wrecked all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I dont know why your girl keeps pagin me
She tell me that she needs me cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me she squeeze melady take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy but tease me
I dont want it if its that easy
Ayo bust it baby got a problem saying Byebye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask Why dont matter my pockets got fatter
Now everybodys lookin for the latter
And aint no need in being greedy if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And Ill be there in a jiffy
Dont be picky just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you cant tie me down
Baby doll check it out I get around

Round and round
Now you can tell from my everyday fits I aint rich
So cease and desist with them tricks  Tricks 
Im just another black man caught up in the mix  mix 
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents  A dime and a nickel 
Just cause Im a freak dont mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see that you dont recognize me
Im Shock G the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me I get around
Whats up love How you doin  All right 
Well Ive been hangin sangin tryna do my thang oh you heard that I was bangin
Your homegirl you went to school with Thats cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin Thought I wasnt  Uhh 
See weekends were made for Michelob
But its a Monday my day so just let me hit it yo
And dont mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around
Round and round around we go

Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip dont slip loose lips sink ships
Its a trip I love the way she licks her lips see me jockin
Put a little twist in her hips cause Im watchin
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now were all alone why the lights on
Turn them off Time to set it off get you wet and soft
Somethin is on your mind let it off
You dont know me you just met me you wont let me
Well if I couldnt have it  Silly rabbit  why you sweatin me
Its a lot of real Gs doin time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if youre too fly
You need to hit the door search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned baby doll are you down
