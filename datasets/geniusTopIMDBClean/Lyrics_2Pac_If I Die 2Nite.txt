A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
Tonights the night I get in some shit
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock Gs
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
Pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is badmouth cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes the game should be sold
Im sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even Mama couldnt raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldnt reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
Im duckin the cops I hit the weed as Im clutchin my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block what if I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it if I die tonight
Tonights the night I get in some shit
Polish your pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to poppin niggas is droppin then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method whenever steppin keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posses using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name a different game aint a thing changed
Im seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here if I die tonight
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga is ya ha
If I die tonight
Never fear never worry
If I die tonight
Tonights the night I get in some shit


Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Pray to the Heavens 357s to the sky
And I hope Im forgiven for thug livin when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin these simps for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game praying for punishment and pain
Going insane never die I live eternal who shall I fear
Dont shed a tear for me nigga I aint happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading Murdered to death my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers dont understand if I die tonight
Nigga if I die tonight
No fear nigga never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight
You know
Tonights the night I get in some shit
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
Tonights the night I get in some shit
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
Kill kill kill murder murder murder
