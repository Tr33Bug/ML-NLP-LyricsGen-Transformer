Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots  Oh 
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if dont nobody else care  Oh 
And uh I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
Forgive but dont forget girl keep ya head up
And when he tells you you aint nothin dont believe him
And if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sister you dont need him
And I aint tryin to gas you up I just call em how I see em  You dont need him 
You know what makes me unhappy  Whats that 
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy  Oh yeah yeah yeah 
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman  Yeah yeah 
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
Why Why Why Why Why Why 
I think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we dont well have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies  Oh yeahyeah 
And since a man cant make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know youre fed up ladies but keep ya head up
Keep ya head up 
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keepkeep ya head up 
Ooh child thingsll get brighter
Ohoh keep ya head up 
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keepkeep ya head up 
Ooh child thingsll get brighter
Ayo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right  Oh yeahyeah 
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for the pen
I try to find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity  Oh no no no 
It seems the rainll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up huh
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Said it aint no hope for the youth
And the truth is it aint no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy huh
I blame my mother for turnin my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its a setup
And even though youre fed up huh you got to keep ya head up


Keep ya head up 
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keepkeep ya head up 
Ooh child thingsll get brighter
Ohoh keep ya head up 
Ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keepkeep ya head up 
Ooh child thingsll get brighter
And uh to all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it in fact Im sure
And if you fall stand tall and come back for more  Ohoh 
Cause aint nothin worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man feelin helpless  I know you were 
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dyin inside but outside youre lookin fearless
While the tears is rollin down your cheeks
Youre steady hopin things dont all fall this week  Yeah 
Cause if it did you couldnt take it  Yeah 
And dont blame me I was given this world I didnt make it  Oh yeah 
And now my sons gettin older and older
And cold from havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to survivin friends  Oh yeah 
And its crazy it seems itll never let up
But huh please you got to keep your head up
