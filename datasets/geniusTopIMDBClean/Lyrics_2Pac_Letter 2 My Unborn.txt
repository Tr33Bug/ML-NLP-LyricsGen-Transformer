To my unborn child
To my unborn child
In case I dont make it
Just remember Daddy loves you
Now ever since my birth Ive been cursed since Im born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison blessed and still livin
Tryna earn every penny that Im gettin
Im reminiscin to the beginnin of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther loud single parent but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school but I dropped out and left the house
Cause my mama say Im good for nothin so Im out
Since I only got one life to live God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and Ill never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life aint promised but its sure gettin better
Hope you understand my love letter to my unborn child
Im writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didnt know I feel this way
Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein anxious
Aint no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
Its hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play
I got shot five times but Im still breathin
Living proof theres a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way
Dear Mama Im a man now
I wanna make it on my own not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets aint no love no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again to my unborn child


Im writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didnt know I feel this way
Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Dear Lord can you hear me
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs
Cause bein black hurts and even worse if you speak first
Livin my life as an Outlaw  what could be worse
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Whom I kiddin Im a thug til I die Im a rider mane
Touch bases eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If theres a ghetto for true thugs Ill see you there
And Im sorry for not bein there
Just know your daddy was a soldier Me Against the World
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord Im eternal restin in peace
Please take care of all my seeds to my unborn child
Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
To my unborn child
This letter goes out to my seeds
That I might not get to see cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothin but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age youll understand
Just know I got love for you
And Ill see you if theres a ghetto in Heaven
If theres a Ghetto Heaven Ill be there waitin for you
Heh heh take care run wild but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes theres confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dimeadozen
Be an individual work hard
Study get your mind sharp trust nobody
