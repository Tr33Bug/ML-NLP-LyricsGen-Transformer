How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas we the last ones left but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas we the last ones left but life goes on
As I bail through the empty halls breath stinkin in my jaws
Ring ring ring  quiet yall incomin call
Plus this my homie from high school he gettin by
Its time to bury another brother nobody cry
Life as a baller alcohol and booty calls
We used to do em as adolescents do you recall
Raised as Gs loced out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof lets get smoked out and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high assed out
Screamin Thug til I die before I passed out
But now that youre gone Im in the zone
Thinkin I dont wanna die all alone but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin memories
I love them niggas to death Im drinkin Hennessy
While tryin to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed cause life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas we the last ones left but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas we the last ones left and life goes on
Yeah nigga I got the word its hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time wont see parole
Imagine life as a convict thats gettin old
Plus with the drama were lookin out for your babys mama
Takin risks while keepin cheap tricks from gettin on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin on dumb hotties at yo party
Me and you no truer two while schemin on hits
And gettin tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried  rest nigga cause I aint worried
Eyes blurry sayin goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball til my dyin days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace Thug til I die
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas we the last ones left but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas we the last ones left cause life goes on
Bury me smilin with Gs in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin in case I dont get in
Tell all my people Im a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die we Outlawz let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane got police chasin me
To my niggas from old blocks from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor have a toast for the homies
See we both gotta die but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own how long we mourn Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas we the last ones left but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G

Niggas doin life
