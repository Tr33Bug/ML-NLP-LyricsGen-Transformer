Its just me against the world
Nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy
Stress in the city the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin there aint no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Cant reach the children cause theyre illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin but will they last or be blasted
Hardheaded bastard maybe hell listen in his casket
The aftermath more bodies bein buried
Im losin my homies in a hurry theyre relocatin to the cemetery
Got me worried stressin my visions blurry
The question is will I live no one in the world loves me
Im headed for danger dont trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever Im feelin this anger
Dont wanna make excuses
Cause this is how it is whats the use
Unless were shootin no one notices the youth
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Its just me against the world
Its just me against the world
Me against the world
Cause its just me against the world baby  Hey 
Me against the world  Ooh yeah 
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
I got nothin to lose
Could somebody help me Im out here all by myself see
Ladies in stores Baby Capones livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what Im dreamin
Seein Daddys semen full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw
Veteran a villain a young thug who one day shall fall
Everyday theres mo death and plus Im doughless
Im seein more reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the schemin and leave they peeps grievin
Cause aint no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up Im about to act up
Go load the MAC up now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts but yo it aint workin
And evils lurkin I can see him smirkin when I gets to pervin
So what Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin sales riskin 25 with a L but oh well
Me against the world
With nothin to lose  Ooh yeah 
Its just me against the world
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world
Its just me against the world baby
With nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression
They punish the people thats askin questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress to make it stop study your lessons
Dont settle for less even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Dont ever change keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best dont let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things dont go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
Politicians are hypocrites they dont wanna listen
If Im insane its the fame made a brother change
It wasnt nothin like the game its just me against the world
Me against the world
Nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game  Ooh yeah 
Its just me against the world
Nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Hahaha thats right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But uh remember one thing
Through every dark night theres a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out keep your head up and handle it
