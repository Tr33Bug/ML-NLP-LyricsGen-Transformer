Shit you mothafuckin right
Im the bitch thats keepin it live and keepin it hot
When you punkass niggas dont
Nigga west side What Bring it on
Look for me lost in the whirlwind
96 Bonnie and Clyde me and my girlfriend
Doin 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child raised in this whirlwind  cmon 
Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
Smokin sherm drinkin malt liquor  father forgive em
Me and my girlfriend hustlin
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel blush while she bail out bustin
Fuck em all watch em fall screamin
Automatic gunfire exorcisin all demons
My mafioso messiah my congregation high ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back niggas unite
Our first date couldnt wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you redhot you so happy to see me
Make the front page prime time live on TV
Nigga my girlfriend baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a niggas heartbeat stop
What Im bustin on you punkass niggas
Run nigga run Im on yo ass nigga
Run nigga Duck and hide
When Im bustin on all you bitches
Run nigga Yeah Westside
Uh Uh Uh Die nigga die


My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitchmade she got the heart to fight
Nigga my girlfriend though we separated at times
I knew deep inside baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
Its true nothin compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you the secret to keep you
Being faithful cause now cheatings lethal
Were closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly I shoot blind
In time I clock figures droppin niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in Gods eyes
Now its time for war never leave me baby
Im paranoid sleepin with you loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
Im waitin by the phone this is true love I can feel it
Ive had a lot of women in my bed but you the realest
So if you ever need me call Ill be there through it all
Youre the reason I can stand tall me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
I love fingerfuckin you all of a sudden Im hearin thunder
When you bust a nut niggas be duckin or takin numbers
Love to watch you at a block party beggin for drama
While unleashin on the oldtimers thats on my mama
I would trade my life for yours behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore everything Im askin for
Talkin to me beggin me to just take you around
Seventeen like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd bustin rounds activatin a riot
Thats why I love you so no control down to roll unleash
After a hit you break apart then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend the world is ours
Just hold me down baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Me and my girlfriend
Lost in the whirlwind
96 Bonnie and Clyde me and my girlfriend
Doin 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child raised in this whirlwind
Look for me lost in the whirlwind
96 Bonnie and Clyde me and my girlfriend
Doin 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child raised in this whirlwind
Look for me lost in the whirlwind
96 Bonnie and Clyde me and my girlfriend
Doin 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child raised in this whirlwind
Look for me lost in the whirlwind
