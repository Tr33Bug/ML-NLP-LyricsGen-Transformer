Never
You aint never had a friend like me
Believe that
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
See at night I watch the sky
I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like its the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Aint never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my dogs from the county jail
Sending me mail
Heard the blocks in the same shape
Aint nothing changed
Niggas slanging at the same place
The same faces
Suppose to always hate our foes
This lifestyle lives forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding crocodile tears just got life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just stay strong well appeal nigga youll be free
Down with ya to the very end
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
Im down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where well be
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
Im down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where well be
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
How can I be blamed Forgive me Lord Im insane
In search of fame wont hurt to change
Following the foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with Ski masks no witnesses as we blast squealers
And now they feel us in this act of war
More casualties no survivors
Any man that defy us quickly dies cause we riders
In my quest for chips
We wear vests equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin
Cause niggas died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world aint ready for us yet so lets make Clinton pay
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we possess
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smokin weed bumpin this beat
Makin a livin out of my misery
Til he got a friend like me
Im down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where well be
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
Im down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where well be
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
Promise to visit
I know its rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was younger
I could picture livin
In luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama he alone die nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties why the fuck should I let you live
When Im dead inside
Rapid fire my delivery
Im bustin at they whole crew
Nigga remember me
Hit up my Outlawz set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin
Its visitin day at San Quentin
Always there to see your closest roaddog
Cause you aint ever had a friend like me
Im down for you so ride with me
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where well be
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
Im down for you so ride with me
