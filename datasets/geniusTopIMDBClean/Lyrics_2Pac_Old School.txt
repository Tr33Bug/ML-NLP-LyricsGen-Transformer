Here we go we gon send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx and Brooklyn and Staten Island
Queens and all the motherfuckers that laid it down the foundation
Ya know what Im sayin Nothin but love for the old school
Thats who were gonna do this one for ya feel me
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
I remember Mr Magic Flash Grandmaster Caz
LL Raising Hell but that didnt last
Eric B  Rakim was the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E Fresh show with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin in work with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin ill when shit was real
Went out to steal
Remember Raw with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I cant explain how it was Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects and on my block
You diggy dont stop sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit nuttin like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way


I had Shell Toes and BVDs
A killer crease inside my Lees when I hit the streets
Im playin skelly Ringolevio or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch
I remember way back the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
Im on the train headin uptown freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown profilin
Cause the hoochies was starin thinkin what them niggas wearin
Im wonderin if thats her hair I remember
Stickball humpin hoochies on the wall
Or takin leaks on the steps stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryna stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights tryna keep it true
Out on the roof sippin 90 proof aint nuttin like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
Remember poppin and lockin to Kurtis Blow the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarter
When Slick Rick was spittin La Di Da Di
Gamin the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties
I remember breakdancin to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV Id rather hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful dont let the transit cops see me
It aint nuttin like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way

Remember motherfuckers used to go Is Brooklyn in the house
And motherfuckers would lose they God Damn Mind
Thats the old school to me thats what Im sayin  Super Sperm 
I remember goin places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin old school nigga
Remember skelly nigga Knockin niggas out the box poppin boxes My Adidas

Remember the block Member screamin up at your moms from the window
LL Cool J is hard as Hell
