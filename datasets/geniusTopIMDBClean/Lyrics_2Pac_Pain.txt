I couldnt help but notice your pain
My pain
It runs deep  share it with me
Theyll never take me alive Im gettin high with my fourfive
Cocked on these suckas time to die
Even as a youngster causin ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin up dust
But now Im labeled as a troublemaker  who can you blame
Smokin weed helped me take away the pain
So Im hopeless rollin down the freeway swervin dont worry
Im bout to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me  what should I do
I had to feed my fuckin family  what else could I do
But be a thug Out slangin with the homies
Fuck hangin with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger never been a stranger to homicide
My citys full of gangbangers and drivebys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse mind full of sick thoughts
And I aint goin back to court so fuck what you thought
Im drinkin Hennessy runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be 23 Theres so much pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Years and years of that rough life
Runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife
And livin trifed on the regular buckin out competitors
See em fake a move and chase em down like the fuckin Predator
Get in trouble every day in school act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin off for the bitches cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop pop pop and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo currency kept passin me by but I didnt cry broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin coke
And now the moneys lookin lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick em the game its all the same
I kick it back yo give em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman you heard man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn At least Im realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo ass twisted so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan kickin major dust
So if you owe nigga look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame its a deep game
And my mama always cryin yo theres so much pain


Ohhhh
So tired so tired
Ohhhh
Soso
They got me mobbin like Im loced and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I aint scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust  I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust  on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck cause I aint lookin when Im bblastin
Im a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Dont wanna die tell me why Cause this stress is gettin major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until Im dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
Im real they cannot see and every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin on the streets and Ill be ballin loc
Dont let em make you worry keep swingin at these suckas til you buried
I was born to raise hell a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother Im touched
Out kickin dust up ready to bust
Im on the scene steady muggin mean until they kill me
Ill be livin this life I know you feel me theres so much pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhhhh
