Yeah clear enough for ya  alright 
Why niggas look mad
Yall supposed to be happy Im free
Yall niggas look like yall wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas
Picture me rollin in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas theres no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
I swear somebody be tellin
Know theres dope bein sold but I aint the one sellin
Dont want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed I feed em lead
Now Im released how will I live
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did to feed kids
One life to live its so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin at your crib
Mama Im still thuggin the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates and most of them dead wrong
Full grown finally a man just schemin on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that isnt stolen
My dreams is censored my hopes are gone
Im like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked heart beatin
And my hands are swollen
Thinkin of the Gs Ill be holdin picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Ooh wee
Can you see me now
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it
Picture me rollin
Yeah nigga
Aye but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess whos back
I got keys comin from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 Gs
Im a street commando Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause Im more like a boss player
Thug branded to be a womenlayer
So many player haters imitators steady swangin
Make me wanna start back bangin
So Im caught up in the game dress code changed
Packin 40 Glocks contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin from my enemies
While Im sippin on Rmy
In front of black Lexus Chevys on the roam
96 big body sittin on chrome
As we head up out the zone stonefacin is on
You can admire but dont look too long
Im livin a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin
Its hard to imagine picture me rollin


Picture me rollin
Picture picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me rollin
Picture me
I gots to get the fuck up in it formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight sufferin from lack of havin paper
My bitch fin to have a bastard see
So I needs to hit a lick drastically
I see some ballinass niggas and they slippin in my spot
And uh diggin the plots  so what 
Checkin in the park Pac
We caught him sleepin
He didnt peep you niggas creepin
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness its time to count the profit
CPO you got the bomb spot
