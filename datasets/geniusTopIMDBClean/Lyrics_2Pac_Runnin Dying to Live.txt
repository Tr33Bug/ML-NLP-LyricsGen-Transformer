Runnin  Dying to Live  Lyrics
Between you and Biggie it was like whos gonwhos gon who rules the nigga kingdom and shit basically you know what Im saying I was like this is like a fucking
It is that
Election Its an election and shit
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggies situation is smaller than that Me and Biggies situation is like
You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
You dont know 
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die
Check it I grew up a fuckin screwup
Got introduced to the game got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that
Nigga Im too fat I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
Thats why I bust back it dont faze me
When he drop take his Glock and Im Swayze
Celebrate my escape sold the Glock bought some weight
Lay back I got some money to make motherfucker
You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die
Its on me 
But still Im havin memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushin the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole worlds tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do
But stay true sippin 22s of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin questions tryna stress me
Misery is all I see thats my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes slipped got arrested and flipped
He screamed Thug Life and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin from the police


You know I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die
They wanted a new regime And my regime includes East coast includes West coast
I was more shocked than anything
You know what Im sayin
But I wasnt more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him Pac is a strong dude yo
I know dude you know what Im sayin Real strong
So when they was like he got shot I was just more like Again you know what Im sayin
He always getting shot or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it and its going to be over
You know what Im sayin
But when he when he died I was just like whoa you know what Im saying Kinda took me by
I mean even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what Im sayin
Because there aint no coming back from that
