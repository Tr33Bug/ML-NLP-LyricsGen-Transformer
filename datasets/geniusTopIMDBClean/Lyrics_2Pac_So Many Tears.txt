I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven
Back in elementary I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed
Inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me Im not livin in the past
You wanna last Be the first to blast
Remember Kato no longer with us hes deceased
Call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
Ahh I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Now that Im strugglin in this business by any means
Label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause Im cursed
Im havin visions of leavin here in a hearse
God can you feel me
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
Im goin blind I spend my time in this cell aint livin well
I know my destiny is Hell where did I fail
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire Ill shed so many tears
Lord I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Now Im lost and Im weary so many tears
Im suicidal so dont stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now theres nothin left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldnt rest Im barely standin
About to go to pieces screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted I couldnt see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
Inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
No memories just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
Will I survive til the morning to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins cause here I come


Lord  God 
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God I lost so many peers
And Lord knows I tried been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin lives little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Brokenhearted as I glance at the chalk line gettin high
This aint the life for me I wanna change
But aint no future bright for me Im stuck in the game
Im trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately Ive been really wantin babies
So I could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
Dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
Im hearin noises think shes fuckin all my boys
Cant take no more Im fallin to the floor
Beggin for the Lord to let me in to Heavens door
Shed so many tears  God please help me 
Lord I lost so many years  I suffered through the years 
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
