Starin at the world through my rearview
Just lookin back at the world
From another level you know what I mean Starin
Multiple gunshots clear the block the fun stops
Snitches is callin cops people shot nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me then they lie to me
Product of a dyin breed all my homies tryin weed
Now the little babies crazed raised off Hennessy
Tell me will my enemies flee when they see me
Believe me even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen through intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin bad boys to grown men its on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end my friend Im seein nothin but my dreams comin true
While Im starin at the world through my rearview
See Im seein nothin but my dreams comin true
While Im starin at the world through my rearview
They got me starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Now you see him now you dont
Some niggas be here for the moment and then they gone
What happened to em
Well lets see it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast left far Im through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin until our dreams come through
Starin at the world through my rearview


Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell countin days in this livin black hell
Do you feel me Keys to ignition use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section from years of chincheckin
Turn to Smith  Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father Im a soldier
Im gettin hotter cause the worlds gettin colder
Baby let me hold ya talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question
Do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rearview
I said now I know the answer
Do dreams come true
Starin at the world through my rearview
They got me starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
Nigga Kadafi say
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Ninesix for Glocks
Cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets
Somethin I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that only one life to lead a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted infested since a seed
We all die breed bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns Outlawz and truants
Shits deep turn eighteen burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty or choosin my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too Im starin through your rearview
Hahahaha you aint knowin what we mean by starin through the rearview
So since you aint knowin what we mean let me break it better understandin the worldThe world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin on the game and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world aint no trick no more the world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world from high watch behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do just gotta put our mind to it and do it its all about the papers money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do what they wanna do bitch niggas do what they can
They got me starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
