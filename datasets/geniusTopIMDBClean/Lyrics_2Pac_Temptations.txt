Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
Yo Mo Bee mayn drop that shit
You know what time
Booyaow I know its time for you
So grab one by the hand you know what Im sayin
And uh throw up that finger
Hey yo throw yall fingers up
Thug style baby thug style yknow
Tell me baby are you lonely Dont wanna rush ya
I can help ya if youre only let me touch ya
If Im wrong love tell me cause I get caught up
In the life I live its Hell see I never thought Id
See the day when I would calm down you aint heard
Ive been known to clown and get around thats my word
See you walking and you looking good yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend youre killing me
With your attitude to match right Dont be phony
Cause I hate it when you act like you dont know me
Ive been stressing in the spotlight I want the fame
But the industrys a lot like a crap game
Aint no time for commitment I gotta go
Cant be with you every minute miss another show
And even though Im known for my one night stand  Look here 
I wanna be an honest man but temptations go
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
Throw up the finger
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
And all my homies go
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
Give em the finger
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
You know what baby its like
I know youve been searching for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I cant be there and will you still care
Will I cheat or will I be committed Heaven knows
Getting weak and I wanna hit it so here I go
In my ride and Im all in gettin high
I can hear the people calling Im passing by
Everybody knows Im balling and to God
Gotta keep myself from falling but its hard
All the cuties know Im under pressure what do I do
Getting shaky when she pull the dress up and say its cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while You decide
If you tell me that you dont want it thats a lie
Move close and let me whisper some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby dont rush I like it slow
Cant hold it any longer so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in Heaven
And dont worry I let myself in all I heard was
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
Give em the finger
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
And all my homies go
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
Give em the finger
Heyyyy Heyyayyaahhyy
Its just the thug in me
You know what baby its like
I know youve been searchin for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I cant be there and will you still care
A lot of people think its easy to settle down
Got a woman thatll please me in every town
I dont wanna but I gotta do it the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me take my hand
Cause even thugs get lonely understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Lets find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that its passion hold me tight
Dont need lights I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man aint lovin you right
Youre lonely and depressed you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin you want me to leave Ill get to walkin
See you later cause baby Im a player and all I heard was
Give em the finger and all my homies go
Yo this how we gonna do this in the ninetrey yknow
Throw your fingers up
You know They gonna peep this
This how we run game on you
All my niggas go uptown in the give em the finger
Throw your hands up give em the finger
