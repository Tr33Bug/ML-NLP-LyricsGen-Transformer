The Rose That Grew From Concrete  Autobiographical  LyricsDid you hear about the rose that grew from a crack
in the concrete
Proving natures laws wrong it learned 2 walk
without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
it learned 2 breathe fresh air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else even cared
