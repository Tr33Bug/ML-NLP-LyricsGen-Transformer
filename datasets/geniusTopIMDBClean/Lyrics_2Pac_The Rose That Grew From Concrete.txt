Poems written by Shakur as  interpreted by other artists
You try to plant somethin in the conrete yknowhatImean
If it GROW and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks you not gon say Damn look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete
You gon be like Damn A rose grew from the concrete
Same thing with me yknahmean I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin Damn he did this he did this
Just be like DAMN He grew out of that He came out of that
Thats what they should say yknowhatImean
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty nasty
YknowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
Im just tryin to make somethin
When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin natures laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete
Provin natures laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but by keepin its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared
The rose that grew from concrete
Did you hear
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete
Provin natures laws wrong
It learned to walk without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
Keepin all these dreams
Provin natures laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet  to breathe the fresh air 
It came from concrete  to breathe the fresh air 
to breathe the fresh air to breathe the fresh air 
You see you wouldnt ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals On the contrary we would all celebrate its
Tenacity We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well we are the roses  this is the concrete  and these are
My damaged petals Dont ask me why thank God nigga ask me how
Hahahaha
