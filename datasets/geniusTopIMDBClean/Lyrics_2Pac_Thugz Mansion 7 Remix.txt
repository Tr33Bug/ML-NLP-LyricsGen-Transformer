Thugz Mansion  Lyrics
Shit tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong thats just for us
Niggas aint gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Yknahmean Where do niggas go when we die
Aint no heaven for a thug nigga
Thats why we go to thug mansion
Thats the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide and woulda tried
But when I held that 9 all I could see was my mamas eyes
No one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
Not knowin its hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs aint have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we Gs
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my minds eye I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chillin with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromedout mansion in paradise in the sky


Will I survive all the fights and the darkness
Trouble sparks they tell me Home is where the heart is
Dear departed I shed tattooed tears
And couldnt sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us theyd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they cant stand us
Is there a way for me to change
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
Cause all the rest dead is there a spot for us to grow
If you find it Ill be right behind ya show me and Ill go
How can I be peaceful Im comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream Peace while the other man shot him
I need a house thats full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chillin with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromedout mansion in paradise in the sky
Dear Mama dont cry your baby boys doin good
Tell the homies Im in Heaven and they aint got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night it had me shook
Drinkin peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin there kickin it with Malcolm til the day came
Little Latasha sho grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that shes forgiven so come home
Maybe in time youll understand
Only God can save us when Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on they in Heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what Im askin
Remember this face save me a place in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chillin with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky  In thugs mansion 
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromedout mansion in paradise in the sky  Thugs mansion 
Aint no place Id rather be
Chillin with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky  In thugs mansion 
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromedout mansion in paradise in the sky
