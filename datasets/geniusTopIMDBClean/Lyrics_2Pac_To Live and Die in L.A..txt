To Live and Die in LA Lyrics
Street Science youre on the air What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pacs new one
I love 2Pacs new record
Right but dont you feel like that creates tension between East and West I mean hes talking about killing people I had sex with your wife  and not in those words But hes talking about I wanna see you deceased
I love LA
No Doubt
To live and die in LA  California 
No matter what you say about Los Angeles
Its still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California
To live and die in LA
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash so its hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark
Cold part about it nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin to floss on him blind to a broken mans dream
A hard lesson court cases keep me guessin
Plea bargain aint an option now so Im stressin
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin money off of cuss words writin again
Learn how to think ahead so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset likin the sin
Whats the worst they can do to a nigga
Got me lost in Hell to live and die in LA on bail
My angel sing
To live and die in LA its the place to be
And the angels go
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in LA
To live and die in LA its the place to be
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Its the city of angels and constant danger
South Central LA cant get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watchin the ghetto bird helicopters
I observe so many niggas gettin three strikes tossed in jail
I swear the pen right across from hell
I cant cry cause its on now
Im just a nigga on his own now
Livin life thug style so I cant smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code Bs and Cs
All them other niggas copycats these is Gs
I love Cali like I love women
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of thug in em
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this well burn this bitch down get us pissed
To live and die in LA
To live and die in LA its the place to be
Let my angels sing
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in LA its the place to be
To live and die in LA
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
It wouldnt be LA without Mexicans
Black love Brown Pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin to see us all broke
Im on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY Weekends Crenshaw MLK
Automatics rang free niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown nigga love yo hood
But recognize and its all good
Where the weed at Niggas gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mufucka permed out
MOB Big Suge in the LoLo bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone Tre Heron Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked but this ones for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel hopin it pay
Gettin high watchin time fly to live and die in LA
To live and die in LA its the place to be
Let my angel sing
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in LA its the place to be
To live and die in LA
Youve got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Let my angel sing
This go out for 923 and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin my shit
Makin my shit sells quadruple quintuple platinum
To live and die in LA mhmmm 
This go out to all the magazines that support a nigga
All the real motherfuckers
To live and die in LA mhmmm 
All the stores the mom and pop spots
