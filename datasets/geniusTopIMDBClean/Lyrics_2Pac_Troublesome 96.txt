Troublesome nigga
Hahaha troublesome 19motherfuckin96
Westside  Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses Makaveli
Menacin methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin niggas die witnessin breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams of rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends fuck friends and foes
Me a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me you lil brat
Shit them niggas that shot me is still terrified Ill get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We Outlawz motherfuckers cant kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit but thats after Im gone
Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known Im troublesome
La la la la la la
La lala la lahhh
Bye bye bye bye
All you niggas die
Troublesome nigga Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin rhymes and bullets ha ha
We troublesome
Yall know what time it is
Call the punk police they cant stop us
Niggas run the streets we troublesome
Gutter ways my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet I bomb on em first
Niggas knew we came for murder pullin up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin off freely
Screamin Fuck all yall niggas in Swahili
Pistol packin fresh out of jail I aint goin back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor learned to get high and pull drivebys
Murder my foes cant control my nine
Hearin thoughts of my enemies pleadin please
Bustaass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass when I dumped he died
Cause Im troublesome


La la la la la la
La lala la lahhh
Bye bye bye bye
All you niggas die
Young strapped and I dont give a fuck
Im hopeless
I live the Thug Life losin my focus baby
Im troublesome ha ha
Bad Boy killa there is no one realer
What you saw
Was the rough rugged and raw Outlaw
Murder murder my mind state shit aint changed
Since my last rhyme the crime rate aint decline
Niggas bustin shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga Either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep Im havin crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies family times
God forgive me cause its wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell cause I aint beggin for my life
Aint nothin worse than this cursedass hopeless life
Im troublesome
La la la la la la
La lala la lahhh
Bye bye bye bye
