What yall want 
Unconditional love  no doubt 
Talkin about the stuff that dont wear off it dont fade
Itll last for all these crazy days these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you still feel you
Still there for you no matter what  hehe 
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love
Come listen to my truest thoughts my truest feelings
All my peers doin years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see its hard to live this life without God
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room  hey 
One day I hope to make it a player in this game
Mama dont cry long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps its just a fantasy
A life where we dont need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe its me that caused it the fightin and the hurtin
In my room cryin because I didnt wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I aint worried bout a damn thing with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love

Just got the message youve been callin all week
Been out here hustlin on these streets
Aint had a chance to speak
But you know with you and me its all G
We could never be enemies
Cause youve been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it aint easy bein who we are
Driven by my ambitions desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of todays generation if I could make em listen
Prison aint what we need no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan strategize my familys gotta eat
We work somethin out of nothin
No pleasure in the sufferin
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin
The liquor and the weed the cussin
Sendin love out to my block
The struggle never stops  unconditional love

Ill probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin to change your ways
While gettin paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin inside please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe its the way I played it in my heart
I know one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes so many vivid pictures
And all the currency Ill never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters cause after all the lights and screams nothin but my dreams matter
Hopin for better days maybe a peaceful night
Baby dont cry cause everything gon be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Dont worry bout a thing baby girl Im a soldier  huh 
Never treated me bad no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love
repeat to fade
