Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency but you could run to me when you need
And Ill never leave honestly
Someone to believe in as you can see
Its a small thing to a true what could I do
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew hed do the same thing if he could
Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin up call the cops
Bringin a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but its clear Ill always be the same
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
Until the end of time 
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids
So you know I dont hang around the house much
This allnight money makin got me outta touch
Shit aint flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin solo
Ride out alone in my lolo
Watchin the whole world move in slowmo
For quiet times disappear listen to the ocean
Smokin Ports think my thoughts then its back to coastin
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I aint trippin Im a player I aint sweatin him
I sexed his sister had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin no remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin the only thing I did good was scrappin
Until the end of time


So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
Until the end of time 
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Now whos to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin easily
Falls to they knees they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin me to keep the peace  haha 
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger dont freeze time to be a G
Follow my lead Ill supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out thats what Im about more
Gettin raw til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
Until the end of time 
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
