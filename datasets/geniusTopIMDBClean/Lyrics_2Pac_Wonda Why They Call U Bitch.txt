Look here Miss Thang hate to salt your game
But yous a moneyhungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room all the homies do is laugh
High fives cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy even easy
Sleepin around for what you need see
Its your thing and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But dont be bad play the game get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin for a way out and thats okay
I can see you wanna stray theres a way out
Keep your mind on your money enroll in school
And as the years pass by you can show them fools
But you aint tryin to hear me cause youre stuck
Youre headin for the bathroom bout to get tossed up
Still lookin for a rich man you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin to get rich
I love you like a sister but you need to switch
And thats why they called you bitchI betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch

You leave your kids with your mama
Cause your headin for the club
In a skintight miniskirt lookin for some love
Got them legs wide open while youre sittin at the bar
Talkin to some nigga bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus whats next
You headin to his car for some sex
I pass by cant hold back tears inside
Cause Lord knows for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
Its like your mind dont understand
You dont have to kill your dreams plottin schemes on a man
Keep your head up legs closed eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin
Im hearin rumors so you need to switch
And niggas wouldnt call you bitchI betcha

I guess times gettin hard even harder for you
Cause hey now got a baby on the way now
More money from the county and thanks to the welfare
Youre about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date cant be late
Trick or treat sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin while he gamin you so baby peep the rules
I shouldve seen it in the first case the worst case
I shouldve never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school baby you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change cause you dont look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you baby thats a shame
Caught HIV and now you bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now Cause everybody left
They stepped and left you on your own
See I loved you like a sister but you died too quick
And thats why we called you bitchI betcha

Dear Ms Delores Tucker keep stressin me
Fuckin with a motherfuckin mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It aint personal strictly business baby strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
