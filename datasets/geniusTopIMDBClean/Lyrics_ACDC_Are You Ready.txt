Are you ready 
Are you ready
Are you ready 
Are you ready
Are you ready 
Are you ready
Sweet apple pie
Standing in the street
Hand out of line
Looking for some meat
She take you high
When you feel her steel
She make you fly
And you know youre comin
Who all need it Who 
Who all need it You 
Who all need it who all need it 
Yes you do
You all breathe it 
We all need it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
She makin eyes
At everything she meet
It aint a crime
When she make you pump heat
She make you fly
Because thats her thing
She make you dry
Then you know youre broken in
Who all need it Who 
Who all need it You 
Who all need it who all need it 
Yes you do
You all breathe it 
We all need it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Get ready
Who all need it who all need it 
You all breathe it 
We all breathe it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Are you ready for a good time 
Are you ready
Are you ready for a good time 
I want a good time
Are you ready for a good time 
Are ya  are you ready
Are you ready for a good time 
Good good good good time
Are you ready for a good time 
Are you ready ready ready
Are you ready for a good time 
Are you ready for a good time
