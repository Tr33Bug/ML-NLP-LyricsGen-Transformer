Breakin balls bangin walls
Work hard and tough and I want some rough
Unpack my bags and take a drag
When bang on nine and Im dead on time
Open up the door
And lay upon the floor
She open her overcoat
Living out her dreams
Rippin off my jeans
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Engine roll and time to go
At razorback a hog attack
Im building steam for whipping cream
She likes a fat smoking stack
Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
Honey shoot your load
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
Wrecking ball let it roll
You are a Ballbreaker
Building steam for whipping cream
You are a Ballbreaker
Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
Honey shoot your load
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
