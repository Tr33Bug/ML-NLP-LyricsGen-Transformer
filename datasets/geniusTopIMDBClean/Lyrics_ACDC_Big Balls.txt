Well Im rather upper class high society
Gods gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballroom
The event is never small
The social pages say Ive got
The biggest balls of all
Ive got big balls
Ive got big balls
Theyre such big balls
And theyre dirty big balls
And hes got big balls
And shes got big balls
But weve got the biggest balls of them all 
And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says Ive got
Great balls of fire
Ive got big balls
Oh Ive got big balls
N theyre such big balls
Dirty big balls
And hes got big balls
And shes got big balls
But weve got the biggest balls of them all 
Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when theyre held for pleasure
Theyre the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
Its my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night
Weve got big balls
Weve got big balls
Weve got big balls
Dirty big balls
Hes got big balls
Shes got big balls
But weve got the biggest balls of them all 
Weve got big balls
Weve got big balls 
And Im just itching to tell you about them
Oh we had such wonderful fun
Seafood cocktail crabs crayfish
But weve got the biggest balls of them all
