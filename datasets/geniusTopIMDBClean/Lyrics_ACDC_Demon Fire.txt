He loves to drive em crazy
With his evil lips
Great guns are blazin
On a deathly trip
Yeah born of no family born of no creed
Yeah raised by a jackal raised a bad seed
You better look around before you hit the ground
Give me no quarrel
Lives of crime
Like a devil on a deadline
Gonna send you down
Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire it glows sapphire
Seeking out power girl Ill hunt you down
Boy Lord of the Flies is gonna knock you out
You better look around
Hear the evil sound
Give me no quarrel drenched in grime
With all the bad intentions
Gonna send you down
Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire it glows sapphire
Demon fire flames burn higher
Demon fire its an allout hellfire

Hey
Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire it glows sapphire
Demon fire flames burn higher
Demon fire its an allout hellfire
Fire demon fire
Fire demon fire
Demon fire
