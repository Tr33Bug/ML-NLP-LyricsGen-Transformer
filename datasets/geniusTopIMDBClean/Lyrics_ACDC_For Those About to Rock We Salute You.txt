For Those About to Rock  We Salute You  Lyrics
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah oh
Oh oh
We roll tonight
To the guitar bite
Yeah yeah
Oh
Stand up and be counted
For what you are about to receive
We are the dealers
Well give you everything you need
Hailhail to the good times
Cause rock has got the right of way
We aint no legend aint no cause
Were just living for today
For those about to rock we salute you
For those about to rock we salute you
We rock at dawn on the front line
Like a bolt right out of the blue
The skys alight with the guitar bite
Heads will roll and rock tonight
For those about to rock we salute you
For those about to rock we salute you
For those about to rock we salute you yes we do
For those about to rock we salute you
Oh salute
Oh yeah
Oh yes
Load up
Were just a battery for hire with a guitar fire
Ready and aimed at you
Pick up your balls and load up your cannon
For a twentyone gun salute


For those about to rock fire
We salute you 
Oh for those about to rock
We salute you 
Oh those about to rock fire
We salute you 
Oh fire
We salute you
We salute you
Come on
Oh
For those about to rock we salute you
For those about to rock we salute you
For those about to rock we salute you
For those about to rock oh we salute you
Shoot shoot
Shoot shoot
Oh for those who give and those who take
Doing your time and those on the rank
We salute you yeah
We salute you
We salute you
We salute you
Fire
