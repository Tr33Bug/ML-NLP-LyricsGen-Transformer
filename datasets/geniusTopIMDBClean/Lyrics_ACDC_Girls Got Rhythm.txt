Ive been around the world
Ive seen a million girls
Aint one of them got
What my lady shes got
Shes stealin the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
Shes enough to start a landslide
Just awalking down the street
Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
About to blow me out
No doubt about it cant live without it
The girls got rhythm  Girls got rhythm 
The girls got rhythm  Girls got rhythm 
Shes got the backseat rhythm  Backseat rhythm 
The girls got rhythm
Ow
Shes like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She give me first degree
She really satisfy me
Love me till Im limbless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War
You know Im losing sleep
But Im in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it cant live without it
The girls got rhythm  Girls got rhythm 
The girls got rhythm  Girls got rhythm 
Shes got the backseat rhythm  Backseat rhythm 
The girls got rhythm
Ow
You know she move like sin
And when she let me in
Its like liquid love
No doubt about it cant live without it
The girls got rhythm  Girls got rhythm 
The girls got rhythm  Girls got rhythm 
Shes got the backseat rhythm  Backseat rhythm 
The girls got rhythm
You know she really got the rhythm  Girls got rhythm 
Shes got the backseat rhythm  Backseat rhythm 
Rock n roll rhythm  Rock n roll rhythm 
The girls got rhythm
