Feel the pressure rise
Hear the whistle blow
Bought a ticket of her own accord
To I dont know
Packed her heart in a travellin bag
And never said byebye
Something missin in the neighborhood
Of her cryin eyes
I stirred my coffee with the same spoon
Knew her favorite tune
Gone shootin
My baby gone shootin
Wrapped herself around
Like a second skin
Backed her favorite nag
But she could never win
I took an offer in another town
She took another pill
She was runnin in an overdrive
A victim of overkill
She never made it past the bedroom door
What was she aiming for
Gone shootin
Shes gone
Gone gone gone
Gone shootin
My babys gone shootin
Look out woo
Gone shootin  How am I gonna get her down
Gone shootin  Ow look out look out look out
Gone shootin  I shouldnt get in her way
Gone shootin  Ah she sure is loaded
Gone shootin  Shes gone gone gone gone shes gone
Gone shootin 

I used to love her so
