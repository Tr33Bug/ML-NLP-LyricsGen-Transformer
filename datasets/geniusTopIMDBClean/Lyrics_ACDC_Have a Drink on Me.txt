Whiskey gin and brandy
With a glass Im pretty handy
Im tryin to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine
So join me for a drink boys
Were gonna make a big noise
So dont worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check well get hell to pay
Have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Im dizzy drunk and fighting
On tequila white lightnin
Yes my glass is gettin shorter
On whiskey ice and water
Yeah so come on have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So dont worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check well get hell to pay
Have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Have a drink on me tonight
Get stoned


Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Come on
Going another round
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swig
Have another drink
Gonna drink you dry
Gonna get me high
Come on all the boys make a noise
Have a drink on me  Have a drink on me 
Have a drink on me  Have a drink on me 
Ah have a drink on me  Have a drink on me 
Have a drink on me
