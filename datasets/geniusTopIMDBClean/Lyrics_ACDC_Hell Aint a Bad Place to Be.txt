Hey you
Yeah you
Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down fool me around
Why she do it to me
Out for satisfaction any piece of action
That aint the way it should be
She needs lovin
Knows Im the man
Shes gotta see
Pours my beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me
Hell aint a bad place to be
Spends my money drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinking Hey just a minute
Something aint right
Disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
All the same you playin your games
Tellin me those lies
Dont mind her playing demon
As long as its with me
If this is hell then let me say
Its heavenly
Hell aint a bad place to be
End of the night
Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears it apart
Brings out the devil in me
Hell aint a bad place to be
I said hell aint a bad place to be
Hell aint a bad place to be
You know that hell aint a bad place to be
