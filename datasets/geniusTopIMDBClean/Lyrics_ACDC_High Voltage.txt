Well you ask me bout the clothes I wear
And you ask me why I grow my hair
And you ask me why Im in a band
I dig doing one night stands
And you want to see me doin my thing
All you got to do is plug me in to
High
I said High
High voltage rock n roll
High voltage rock n roll
High voltage high voltage
High voltage rock n roll
Well you ask me why I like to dance
And you ask me why I like to sing
And you ask me why I like to play
I got to get my kicks some way
And you ask me what Im all about
Come on let me hear you shout
High
I said High
High voltage rock n roll
High voltage rock n roll
High voltage high voltage
High voltage rock n roll
Rock n roll
I said High
I said High
Ow
High voltage rock n roll
High voltage rock n roll
High voltage high voltage
High voltage rock n roll
Stars bulbs
All around the spotlight
Put the lights out turn me on
High voltage rock n roll 
High voltage rock n roll 
Wine women and song
High voltage high voltage 
Plugged in and turned on its sparkin and
High voltage rock n roll
