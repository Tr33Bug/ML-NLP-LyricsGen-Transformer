Living easy lovin free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing leave me be
Taking everythin in my stride
Dont need reason dont need rhyme
Aint nothing Id rather do
Goin down party time
My friends are gonna be there too yeah
Im on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Im on the highway to hell
No stop signs speed limit
Nobodys gonna slow me down
Like a wheel gonna spin it
Nobodys gonna mess me around
Hey Satan payin my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama look at me
Im on the way to the promised land
Woo
Im on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Im on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Dont stop me
Heh heh


Im on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Im on the highway to hell
Highway to hell  Im on the highway to hell
Highway to hell  Highway to hell
Highway to hell  Highway to hell
Highway to hell 
And Im going down
All the way
Im on the highway to hell
