If You Want Blood  Youve Got It  Lyrics
Its criminal
There ought to be a law
Criminal
There ought to be a whole lot more
You get nothing for nothing
Tell me who can you trust
We got what you want
And youve got the lust
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
Blood on the streets blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter every last drop
You want blood you got it
Yes you have
Its animal
Living in a human zoo
Animal
The shit that they toss to you
Feeling like a Christian
Locked in a cage
Thrown to the lions
On the second page
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
Blood on the streets blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter every last drop
You want blood you got it
O Positive
Blood on the rocks blood on the streets
Blood in the sky blood on the sheets
If you want blood youve got it
I want you to bleed for me
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
If you want blood you got it
