Its a Long Way to the Top  If You Wanna Rock n Roll  Lyrics
Ridin down the highway
Goin to a show
Stoppin on the byways
Playin rock n roll
Gettin robbed gettin stoned
Gettin beat up broken boned
Getting had getting took
I tell you folks its harder than it looks
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll
If you think its easy doing one night stands
Try playing in a rockroll band
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll
Hotel motel
Make you want to cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin old gettin gray
Gettin ripped off underpaid
Gettin sold secondhand
Thats how it goes playin in a band
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out its rough and mean
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll
Its a long way to the top if you want to rock n roll
Well its a long way
Oh its a long way
You should have told me 
Its a long way
Such a long way
