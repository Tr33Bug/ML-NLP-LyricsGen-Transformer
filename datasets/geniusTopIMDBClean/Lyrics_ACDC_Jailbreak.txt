There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judges gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him sixteen years in hell
He said I aint spending my life here
I aint livin alone
Aint breakin no rocks on the chain gang
Im breakin out and heading home
Gonna make a  jailbreak 
And Im looking towards the sky
Im gonna make a  jailbreak 
Oh how I wish that I could fly
All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free
Jailbreak  let me outta here
Jailbreak  sixteen years
Jailbreak  had more than I can take
Jailbreak 
He said hed seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
Had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
People start to scream
Big man lyin on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been
But it was all in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free
Jailbreak 
Jailbreak 
I got to break out
Out of here
Heartbeats they were racing
Freedom he was chasin
Spotlights sirens
Rifles firing
But he made it out
with a bullet in his back
Jailbreak jailbreak
Jailbreak jailbreak
Jailbreak jailbreak
Jailbreak jailbreak
Jailbreak jailbreak
