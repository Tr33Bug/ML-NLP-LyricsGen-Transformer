As youre slipping down the wall
And youre headin for a fall
As youre slipping down the wall
Why do they kick you when youre down
Why do they kick you when youre down
Hey mama

Hey hey woman

Is it something is it something that I said
Oh no

And youre headin for a fall
Why do they kick you when youre down
Why do they kick you when youre down
Shady lady
You think that money grows on trees
Rotten apples by the barrel aint a delicacy
And you see
Is this the way the way its meant to be
Oh no 
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
As youre slippin down the wall
And youre headin for a fall
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
So down


And I dont need to say
To say it aint a sacrifice
Is this the way the way its meant to be
Oh no 
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
As youre slippin down the wall
And youre headin for a fall
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
Why do they kick you when youre down
Oh no 
Why do they kick you
Man theyre trying to trick you when youre down
