Flying on a free flight
Driving all night with my machinery
Cause I I got the power any hour
To show the man in me
And those reputations blown to pieces
With my artillery
Ill be guiding well be riding
Give awhat you got to me
Dont you struggle
Dont you fight
Dont you worry
Cause its your turn tonight
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife oh
Oh like a fever burnin faster
You spark the fire in me
Crazy feelings got me reeling
They got me raisin steam
Now dont you struggle
Dont you fight
Dont you worry
Cause its your turn tonight yeah
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife oh
Cut it
Let me
Let me
Ow
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife
Oh let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me give it all
Let me give it all to you
To you
