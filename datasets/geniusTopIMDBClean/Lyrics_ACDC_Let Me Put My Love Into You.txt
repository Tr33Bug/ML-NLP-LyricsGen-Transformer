Let Me Put My Love Into You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Flying on a free flight
Driving all night with my machinery
'Cause I, I got the power, any hour
To show the man in me

And those reputations, blown to pieces
With my artillery
I'll be guiding, we'll be riding
Give a-what you got to me
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight

[Chorus]
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife, oh

[Verse 2]
Oh, like a fever, burnin' faster
You spark the fire in me
Crazy feelings got me reeling
They got me raisin' steam

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife, oh
Cut it

[Chorus]
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife

[Chorus]
Oh, let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me give it all
Let me give it all to you
To you
Give it all9Embed
