In the beginning
Back in nineteenfiftyfive
Man didnt know about a rock n roll show
An all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news
He said Let there be sound
There was sound
Let there be light
There was light
Let there be drums
There was drums
Let there be guitar
There was guitar
Oh let there be rock
And it came to pass
That rock n roll was born
And all across the land every rockin band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The businessmen got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteenmillion fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar
Oh let there be rock
One night in the club called The Shaking Hand
There was a 42 decibel rockin band
And the music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd
Let there be rock
