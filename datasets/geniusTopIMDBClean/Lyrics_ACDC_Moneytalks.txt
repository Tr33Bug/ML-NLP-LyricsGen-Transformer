Moneytalks Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Tailored suits, chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs, all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on dancing through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey, little girl, you want it all
The furs, the diamonds, the paintings on the wall
[Chorus]
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

[Verse 2]
A French maid, foreign chef
A big house with king-size beds
You had enough, you ship them out
The dollar's up, down, you better buy the Pound

[Pre-Chorus]
The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey, little girl, you break the laws
You hustle, you deal, you steal from us all

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money (Moneytalks)
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk (Moneytalks)

[Outro]
(Come on, come on, lovin' for the money) Moneytalks
(Come on, come on, listen to the money talk) Money talk, talk, talk
(Come on, come on, lovin' for the money) Oh, hear it talk
(Come on, come on, listen to the money talk) Yeah, yeah-yeah!
