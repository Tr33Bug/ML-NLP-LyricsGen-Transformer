Yeah
Tailored suits chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on dancing through the night
The claim is on you the sights are on me
So what do you do thats guaranteed
Hey little girl you want it all
The furs the diamonds the paintings on the wall
Come on come on lovin for the money
Come on come on listen to the money talk
Come on come on lovin for the money
Come on come on listen to the money talk
A French maid foreign chef
A big house with kingsize beds
You had enough you ship them out
The dollars up down you better buy the Pound
The claim is on you the sights are on me
So what do you do thats guaranteed
Hey little girl you break the laws
You hustle you deal you steal from us all
