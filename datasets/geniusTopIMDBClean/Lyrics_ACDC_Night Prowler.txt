Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And theres a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someones baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
Cause no ones going to warn you
And no ones going to yell Attack
And you dont feel the steel
Till its hanging out your back
Im your night prowler  I sleep in the day 
Im your night prowler  get out of my way 
Yeah Im the night prowler  watch you tonight 
Yes Im the night prowler when you turn out the light
Too scared to turn your light out
Cause theres something on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window
Whats that shadow on the blind
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room
Im your night prowler  I sleep in the day 
Im your night prowler  get out of my way 
Yeah Im the night prowler  watch you tonight 
Yes Im the night prowler when you turn out the light
Im your night prowler  I sleep in the day 
Im your night prowler  get out of my way 
Yeah Im the night prowler  watch you tonight 
Yes Im the night prowler when you turn out the light
Im your night prowler  I sleep in the day 
Im your night prowler  get out of my way 
Yeah Im the night prowler  watch you tonight 
Yes Im the night prowler when you turn out the light
Im your night prowler  break down your door 
Im your night prowler  crawlin cross your floor 
Im the night prowler  make a mess of you  Yes I will
Night prowler
And Im tellin this to you
There aint nothin there aint nothin
Nothin you can do
Shazbot nanu nanu
