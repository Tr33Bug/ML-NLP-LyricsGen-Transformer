You better give me what I want
Or Ill bleed on you
You dont give me what I need
And Ill come for you
Better keep me on your side or Ill find you in the night
I got your name and your number and Ill set you all ablaze
Best give me what I want
Or Ill come for you
Yes Ill come for you
If you reject me I take what I want
Disrespect me and you get burned
Best keep me satisfied or you know Ill eat you alive
If you reject me I take what I want
I got a ball and chain
And Ill hunt for you
I aint got no name
Ill look out for you
Revenge it aint a sin
Look out Im comin in
Kick me when Im down stand up without a sound
Better play my game
Or Ill bleed on you
Yes I feed on you
If you reject me I take what I want
Take what I want
Disrespect me and you get burned
No I dont want your money or greed
You better give me just what I need
If you reject me
I take what I want
Hey hey take what I want
If you reject me I take what I want
Disrespect me and you get burned
No I dont want your money or greed
You better give me just what I need
If you reject me
I take what I want
Hey hey take what I want
Take what I want
Take what I want
