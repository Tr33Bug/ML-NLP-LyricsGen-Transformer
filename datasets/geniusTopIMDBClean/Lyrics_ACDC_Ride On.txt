Its another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I aint too young to worry
And I aint too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
Mmmh and another empty bed
Aint too young to admit it
And Im not too old to lie
Im just another empty head
Mmmh thats why Im lonely
Im so lonely
But I know what Im going to do
Im gonna ride on
Ride on  Ride on 
Standing on the edge of the road  Ride on 
Thumb in the air  Ride on 
One of these days Im gonna change my evil ways
Till then Ill just keep riding on
Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I aint too young to realize
That I aint too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And its another redlight nightmare
Woah an another redlight street
And I aint too old to hurry
Cause I aint too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat
But Im lonely
Lord Im lonely
What am I gonna do


Ride on ride on 
Got myself a oneway ticket  Ride on ride on 
Goin the wrong way  Ride on 
Gonna change my evil ways
One of these days
One of these days
Ride on ride on 
Im gonna ride on  Ride on 
Mmmh lookin for a truck  Ride on 
Mmmhm keep on riding
Ridin on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Ride on ride on 
Gonna have myself a good time  Ride on 
Mmm yeah  Ride on 
Ride ride ride  Ride on 
One of these days  Ride on 
One of these days
