See it on television every day
Ya hear it on the radio
It aint humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
A barmaids tryin to tell me  haha 
Beginning of the end
Sayin itll bend me
Too late my friend
Riff raff
Oh its good for a laugh
Hahaha
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while
Now Im the kinda guy that keep his big mouth shut
It dont bother me
Somebody kickin me when Im up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Dont even carry a gun
I aint done nothin wrong
Im just having fun
Riff raff
Oh its good for a laugh
Hahaha
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while
Do it again
