Alright
Hey there all you middle men
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while youre out there sittin on the fence
So get off your ass and come down here
Cause rock and roll aint no riddle man
To me it makes good good sense
Good sense just go
Ow
Ooh yes
Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations comin up from the floor
Were just listenin to the rockers givin too much noise
Are you deaf you wanna hear some more
Were just talking about the future
Forget about the past
Itll always be with us
Its never gonna die
Never gonna die
Rock and roll aint noise pollution
Rock and roll aint gonna die
Rock and roll aint noise pollution
Rock and roll it will survive
Yes it will ha ha
I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lyin on your bed
Well I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love
You said you wanna rock and roll instead


Were just talking about the future
Forget about the past
Itll always be with us
Its never gonna die
Never gonna die
Rock and roll aint noise pollution
Rock and roll aint gonna die
Rock and roll aint no pollution
Rock and roll is just rock and roll
Rock and roll aint noise pollution
Rock and roll aint gonna die
Rock and roll aint no pollution
Rock and rollin will survive
Rock and roll aint no pollution
Rock and roll itll never die
Rock and roll aint no pollution
Rock and roll
Ah rock and roll
Is just rock and roll yeah
