Woo
One two
Out on the town looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang out with me
And give me plenty of
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like shes something to sell
I said Baby whats the going price
She told me to go to hell
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Aint it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Singles bar got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really dont care no
Said Baby youre driving me crazy
Laid it right on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
Toss off buddy shes mine
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Aint it a shame yeah
To be shot down in flames
Hey you Angus shoot me shoot
Thats nice woah


Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Aint it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Shot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Aint it a shame
To be shot down in flames
I dont need the pain
Dont want to be shot down in flames
Ohhh
