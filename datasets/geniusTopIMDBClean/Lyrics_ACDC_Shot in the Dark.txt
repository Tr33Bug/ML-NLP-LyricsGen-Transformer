I need a pickmeup a rollin thunder truck
I need a shot of you
That tattooed lady wild like a mountain ride
I got a hunger thats the lovin truth
You got a long night comin
And a long night pumpin
You got the right position
The heat of transmission
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah electric sparks
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park yeah
Blasting on the radio breaking on the TV show
Send it out on all the wires
And if I didnt know any better your mission is to party
Til the broad daylight
You got a long night comin
And a long night goin
You got the right position
The heat of transmission
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah lectric spark
A shot in the dark beats a walk in th park yeah


My mission is to hit ignition
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark
All through the whole night
A shot in the dark
Yeah electric sparks
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park yeah
A shot in the dark
Ooh a shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
A shot in the dark
Make you feel alright
A shot in the dark beats a walk in the park yeah
