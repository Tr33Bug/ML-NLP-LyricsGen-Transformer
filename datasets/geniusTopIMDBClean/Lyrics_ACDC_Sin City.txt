Diamonds and dust
Poor man last
Rich man first
Lamborghinis caviar
Dry martinis ShangriLa
I got a burnin feelin
Deep inside of me
Its a yearning
But Im going to set it free
Im goin in
To sin city
Im gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city
Oh let me roll you baby
Ladders and snakes
Ladders give
Snakes take
Rich man poor man
Beggar man thief
Aint got a hope in hell
Thats my belief
Fingers Freddy Diamond Jim
Theyre gettin ready
Look out Im comin in


So spin that wheel
Cut that pack
And roll those loaded dice
Bring on the dancing girls and put the champagne on ice
Im goin in
To sin city
Im gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I wanna win
In sin city
