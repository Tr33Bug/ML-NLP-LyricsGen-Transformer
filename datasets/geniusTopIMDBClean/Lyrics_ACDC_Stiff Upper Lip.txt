Well I was out on a drive on a bit of a trip
Looking for thrills to get me some kicks
Now I warn you ladies I shoot from the hip
I was born with a stiff  stiff upper lip
Like a dog and I howl
I bite everything
And Im big and I know
And Ill ball your thing
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot and I shoot
Shoot from the hip
Yeah I shoot from the hip
Now listen
Well Im working it out
And Ive done everything yeah
And I cant reform no
Can you feel my sting
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot and I shoot
Shoot from the hip
Yeah I shoot from the hip


Well Im out on the prowl
And Ill ball your thing
I got the teeth thatll bite you
Can you feel that sting
Babe I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot from the hip
I keep a stiff upper lip
And I shoot shoot
Shoot from the hip
I got a  stiff upper lip 
Better believe me  stiff upper lip 
Coming down  stiff upper lip 
See my  stiff upper lip 
Yeah I got a  stiff upper lip 
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
I got a stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
Stiff upper lip
And I shoot
And I shoot
And I shoot
Shoot from the hip
