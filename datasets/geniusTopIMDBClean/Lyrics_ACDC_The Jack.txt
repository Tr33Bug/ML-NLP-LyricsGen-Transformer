She gave me the queen
She gave me the king
She was wheelin and dealin
Just doin her thing
She was holdin a pair
But I had to try
Her deuce was wild
But my ace was high
But how was I to know
That shed been dealt with before
Said shed never had a full house
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
Shed have the card to bring me down
If she played it right
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
Shes got the jack jack jack jack jack jack jack
Shes got the jack
Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She played em fast
And she played em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card
But how was I to know
That shed been shuffled before
Said shed never had a royal flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin
From the bottom of the pack
And if Id known what she was dealing out
Id have dealt it back
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
Shes got the jack and who knows what else
Shes got the jack yeah yeah
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
Shes got the jack jack jack jack jack jack jack
Shes got the jack
Shes got the jack shes got the jack
