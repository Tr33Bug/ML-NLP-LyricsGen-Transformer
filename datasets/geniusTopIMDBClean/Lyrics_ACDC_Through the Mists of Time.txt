See dark shadows
On the walls
See the pictures
Some hang some fall
And the painted faces all in a line
And the painted ladies
Yeah the painted ladies
Through the mists of time  Ahahah ahahah 
The mists of time  Ahahah ahahah 
Of the restless kind  Ahahah ahahah 
Through the mists of time
On a magic ride
Through the mists of time  Ahahah ahahah 
Ahahah ahahah 
Hear the whisper
Of the whirlwind
Monster shadows
A light gone dim
Dark horses
Roam in my sleep
Mystic voices
Conjure up our dreams
And the painted ladies
Yeah the painted ladies
Through the mists of time  Ahahah ahahah 
The mists of time  Ahahah ahahah 
Of the restless kind  Ahahah ahahah 
Through the mists of time
On a magic ride
Through the mists of time


Haahah haahah haahah haahah 
And the painted faces  Haahah haahah 
Looking so divine  Haahah haahah 
Through the mists of time  Haahah haahah 
The mists of time  Haahah haahah 
Of the restless kind  Haahah haahah 
Through the mists of time  Haahah haahah 
On a magic ride  Haahah haahah

Through the mists of time  Haahah haahah
