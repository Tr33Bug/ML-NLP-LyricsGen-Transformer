I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track  Thunder 
I looked round
And I knew there was no turning back  Thunder 
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do  Thunder 
And I knew
There was no help no help from you  Thunder 
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart
Youve been  thunderstruck
Went down the highway
Broke the limit we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah Texas and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules played all the fools
Yeahyeah they they they blew our minds
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please
Yeah the ladies were too kind
Youve been  thunderstruck thunderstruck
Yeahyeahyeah thunderstruck
Oh thunderstruck
Yeah
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please
Yow
