It was one of those nights
When you turn off the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldnt do
It wasnt the first
It wasnt the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove
Seems like a touch a touch too much
Seems like a touch a touch too much
Too much for my body too much for my brain
This damn womans going to drive me insane
She got a touch a touch too much
She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm
It wasnt the first
It wasnt the last
It wasnt that she didnt care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
Seems like a touch a touch too much
Seems like a touch a touch too much
Too much for my body too much for my brain
This damn womans going to drive me insane
She got a touch a touch too much

Touch me
Seems like a touch  Touch too much 
You know its much too much  Much too much 
I really want to feel yeah  Touch too much 
Girl you know youre giving me  Much too much 
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause youre much too much too much too much
Seems like a touch a touch too much
Seems like a touch a touch too much
Givin me a touch a touch too much
Lay me down and touch a touch too much
Seems like a touch a touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
Touch
Come on touch me
Yeah
