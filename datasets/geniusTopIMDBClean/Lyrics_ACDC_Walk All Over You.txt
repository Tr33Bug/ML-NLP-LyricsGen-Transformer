Out of my way Im arunning high
Take a chance with me and agive it a try
Aint no woman in the world dont know
Cause I aint looking for overflow
Oh baby I aint got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels let down your hair
Paradise aint far from there
I wanna walk all over you
Walk all over you 
I wanna walk all over you
Walk all over you 
Do anything you want me to baby
Walk all over you 
I wanna walk all over you
Reflections on the bedroom wall
And there you thought youd seen it all
Were rising falling like the sea
Youre looking so good under me
I wanna walk all over you
Walk all over you 
I wanna walk all over you
Walk all over you 
Do anything you want me to to you
Walk all over you 
I wanna walk all over you


Moanin groanin stirrin it up
So gimme the stage Im gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light
Tonight is gonna be that night
I wanna walk all over you
Walk all over you 
I wanna walk all over you
Walk all over you 
Do anything you want me to baby
Walk all over you 
I wanna walk all over you
