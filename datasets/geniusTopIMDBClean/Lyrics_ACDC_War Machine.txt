Push your foot to the floor
Dont need no more
You been kickin around
While youre messin about
Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild
War machine  war machine 
War machine  war machine 
Make a stand show your hand
Call in a high command
Dont think just obey
Im like a bird of prey
Better catch her name
Come on in
Give me that thing
That thing gone wild
War machine  war machine 
War machine  war machine 
Better watch your back
And cover your tracks
Kick your foot through the door
Hit the deck know the score
Theyre taken by surprise
And heres mud in your eye
Miserys the name if you shoot em for gain
Call of the wild
Hurry for naught
That thing gone wild
War machine  war machine 
War machine  war machine 
Lets go
That thing gone wild
War machine  war machine 
War machine  war machine 
War machine  war machine 
War machine  war machine
