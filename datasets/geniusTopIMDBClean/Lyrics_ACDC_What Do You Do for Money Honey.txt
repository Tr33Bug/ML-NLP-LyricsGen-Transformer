Youre workin in bars ridin in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view on the finest avenue
Lookin at your beat on the street
Youre always pushin shovin satisfied with nothing
You bitch you must be gettin old
So stop your love on the road
All your diggin for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
I wonder
Honey what do you do for money
Honey what do you do for money
Oh where do you get your kicks
Youre lovin on the take and youre always on the make
Squeezin all the blood outta men
Yeah were standin in a queue
Just to spend the night with you
Its business as usual again
Youre always grabbin stabbin trying get it back in
But girl you must be gettin slow
So stop your love on the road
All your diggin for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
Yes I wonder
Honey what do you do for money
Oh honey what do you do for money
What do you do for money honey
How do you get your kicks
What do you do for money honey
How do you get your licks
Go
Honey what do you do for money
I said honey what do you do for money
Oh yeah
Honey  Oh yeah honey
What do you do for money  What you gotta do
Honey  Oh yeah honey
What do you do for money 
What you gonna do
Ah what you gotta do
