The video games say Play me
Face it on a level but it take you every time on a oneonone
Feelin running down your spine
Nothin gonna save your one last dime cause it own you
Through and through
The databank know my number
Says I got to pay cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kick you round the world
There aint a thing that it cant do
Do to you yeah
Who made who who made you
Who made who aint nobody told you
Who made who who made you
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who
Who made who who turned the screw
Satellites send me picture
Get it in the aisle
Take it to the wall
Spinnin like a dynamo
Feel it goin round and round
Running outta chips you got no line in an 8bit town
So dont look down no
Who made who who made you
Who made who aint nobody told you
Who made who who made you
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who
Aint nobody told you
Who made who
Who made you
Who made who
And who made who
Yeah
Nobody told you
