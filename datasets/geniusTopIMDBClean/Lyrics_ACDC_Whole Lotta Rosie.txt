Wan tell you a story
Bout a woman I know
Ah come to loving
She steals the show
She aint exactly pretty
Aint exactly small
Fortytwo thirtynine fiftysix
You could say shes got it all
Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doin all the things
Doin all the things you do
Aint no fairy story
Aint no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone
Youre a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
And youre a whole lotta woman
Oh honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one that turn me
Only one that turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
Woo to my surprise Rosie never stopped
She was a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman


Oh youre a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Youre a whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta womanmanmanmanman
