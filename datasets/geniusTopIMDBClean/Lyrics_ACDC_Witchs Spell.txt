Let me tell you your fortune
It could be sinister or maybe not
Like a leopard
Cant change its own spots
Ride a moonbeam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witchs flight
Caught in a witchs spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witchs spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witchs spell
Good time maker who likes it hot
Like a cardplayin shark who takes the whole lot
And thats a lot 
Ride a moonbeam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witchs flight
Caught in a witchs spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witchs spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witchs spell
Its all coming to ya
Its all coming through ya
I get bathed in the light
The spells just right


Caught in a witchs spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witchs spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witchs spell
Crystal balls and an almanac
She gonna take you to hell and back
Ive got potions snake oil style
Good luck charms and a witchs spell
