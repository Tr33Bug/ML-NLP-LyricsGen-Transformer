Adamâ€™s Apple Lyrics[Verse 1]
Back when Cain was able
Way before the stable
Lightning shot right down from the sky
A mothership with fate said let's give it a try
Conscience was related
Man, he was created
Lady luck took him by surprise
Her sweet and bitter fruit
It surely opened his eyes
[Chorus]
Well, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Well, she ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right

[Verse 2]
Even Eve in eden
Voices tried deceivin'
With lies to show the lady the way
At first she stopped and turned
And tried to walk away
Man, he was believer
Lady was deceiver
So the story goes, but you see
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree

[Chorus]
So, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Well, she ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Conscience was related
Man, he was created
When lady luck took him by surprise
Her sweet and bitter fruits
Surely opened his eyes
Evil came like rain
And who knows who's to blame
And something tried to lay her to waste
And all she want to need was just a little taste
You might also like[Chorus]
So, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Yeah, she ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right
Well, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Yeah, she ate it
Never knowing wrong from right, right
Well that's rightEmbed
