I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin insane
Tryin to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip and I hit the floor
Yeah I thought I could leave but couldnt get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin a lie
I was wishin that I would die
Its amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
Its amazing
When the moment arrives that you know youll be alright
Its amazing
And Im sayin a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
That one last shots a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings
Lifes a journey not a destination
And I just cant tell just what tomorrow brings
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldnt listen to all that righteous talk oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin to survive
Scratchin to stay alive
Its amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
Its amazing
When the moment arrives that you know youll be alright
Its amazing
And Im sayin a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts desperate hearts
So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there wherever you are remember the light at the end of the tunnel may be you Good night
