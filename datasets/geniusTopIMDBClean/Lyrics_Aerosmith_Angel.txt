Im alone
Yeah I dont know if I can face the night
Im in tears and the cryin that I do is for you
I want your love  lets break the walls between us
Dont make it tough  Ill put away my pride
Enoughs enough Ive suffered and Ive seen the light
Baby
Youre my angel
Come and save me tonight
Youre my angel
Come and make it all right
Dont know what Im going to do
About this feeling inside
Yes its true  loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love  Im nothing but a begger
Without your love  a dog without a bone
What can I do Im sleeping in this bed alone
Youre my angel
Come and save me tonight
Youre my angel
Come and make it all right
Youre the reason I live
Youre the reason I die
Youre the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Dont need no reason why
Baby baby
Youre my angel
Come and save me tonight
Youre my angel
Come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
