Back in the Saddle Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again

[Verse 1]
Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for old Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink
That'd make a grown man cry
[Chorus]
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back

[Verse 2]
Come easy, go easy
All right until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fool's gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

[Chorus]
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again

[Bridge]
I'm riding, I'm loading up my pistol
I'm riding, I really got a fistful
I'm riding, I'm shining up my saddle
I'm riding, this snake is gonna rattle
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back

[Outro]
Riding high
Riding high
Riding high already3Embed
