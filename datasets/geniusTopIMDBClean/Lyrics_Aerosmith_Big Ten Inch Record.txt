Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this tricks no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big 10 inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues
Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said now stop that jivin
Now whip out your big 10 inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues
I I I cover her with kisses
And when were in a lovers clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big 10 inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues
My girl dont go for smoking
And liquor just make her flinch
Seems she dont go for nothing
Cept for my big 10 inch
Record of a band that plays the blues
Band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues
