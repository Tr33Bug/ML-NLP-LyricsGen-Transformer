The street is cold the dawn is gray
My heart says no but my head says stay
My work is finished or so Ive been told
You cant part the three of us once we got a hold
I forgot my name
I took a shot on the chin
Im rearranging my game
Tell by the shape Im in
In the line of fire you know what to say
They gave us no choices just one shade of gray
My legs keep moving dont seem to stray
But I know each step we take theyre one step away
I found the secret the key to the vault
We walked in darkness kept hitting the walls
I took the time to feel for the door
I found the secret the key to it all
I got the Nouveauree
And dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said
I find my own fun sometimes for free
I got to pay it to come looking for me
Walking on Gucci wearing Yves Saint Laurent
Barely stay on cause Im so God damn gaunt
I found the secret the key to the vault
We walked in darkness kept hitting the walls
I took the time to feel for the door
I found the secret the key to it all
