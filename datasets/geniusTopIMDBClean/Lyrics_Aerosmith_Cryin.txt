Cryinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I was so broken-hearted
Love wasn't much
Of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
Because me and them ways have parted
That kind of love
Was the killin' kind

[Pre-Chorus]
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me

[Bridge]
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

[Verse 2]
It's down on me
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain somethin'
What you give to me
Takes my breath away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist
You might also like[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me

[Bridge II]
'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me
Baby, baby, baby

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to
[Outro]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery11Embed
