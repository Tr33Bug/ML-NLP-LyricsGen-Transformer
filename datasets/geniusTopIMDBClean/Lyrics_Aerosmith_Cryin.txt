There was a time
When I was so brokenhearted
Love wasnt much
Of a friend of mine
The tables have turned yeah
Because me and them ways have parted
That kind of love
Was the killin kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I cant resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
I was cryin when I met you
Now Im tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin just to get you
Now Im dyin cause I let you
Do what you do down on me
Now theres not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah you cry when were making love
Must be one and the same
Its down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
Its been on my mind
Girl I gotta say
Were partners in crime
You got that certain somethin
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devils in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
Its a fire I cant resist
I was cryin when I met you
Now Im tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin just to get you
Now Im dyin cause I let you
Do what you do to me
Cause what you got inside
Aint where your love should stay
Yeah our love sweet love aint love
Til you give your heart away
I was cryin when I met you
Now Im tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin just to get you
Now Im dyin to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me
Baby baby baby
I was cryin when I met you
Now Im tryin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin when I met you
Now Im dyin to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin when I met you
Now Im tryin to forget you
