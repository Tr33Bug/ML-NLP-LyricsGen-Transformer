I love to look into your big brown eyes
They talk to me and seem to hypnotize
They say the things nobody dares to say
And Im not about to let you fly away
My lover with no jet lag
Were staying up all night in my sleeping bag
You got a heartbeatin rhythm from the subterranean
I really love you little girl
I dont need to explain
I love you cause your deuces are wild girl
Like a double shot of lovin so fine
Ive been lovin you since you was a child girl
Cause you and me is two of a kind
Ah like deja vu I feel like Ive been here
Or somewhere else but youve been always near
Its you thats in my dreams Im beggin for
But I woke up when someone slammed the door
So hard I fell out of bed
Screamin mamas little baby loves shortnin bread
And the moral of the story I can testify
I get stoned on you girl
Thats the best reason why
I love you cause your deuces are wild girl
Like a double shot of lovin so fine
Ive been lovin you since you was a child girl
Cause you and me is two of a kind
