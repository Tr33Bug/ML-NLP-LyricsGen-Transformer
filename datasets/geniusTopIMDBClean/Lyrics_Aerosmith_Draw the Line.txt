Checkmate honey beat you at your own damn game
No dice honey Im livin on a astral plane
Feets on the ground and your heads goin down the drain
Oh heads I win tails you lose to the never mind
When to draw the line
A Indian summer Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet nap winner and rarely ever left the store
Shed sing and dance all night and wrong all the right outa me
Oh pass me the vial and cross your fingers it dont take time
Nowhere to draw the line
Hi ho silver we were singin all your cowboy songs
Oh you told Carrie and promised her you wouldnt be long
Heads I win tails you lose lord its such a crime
No dice honey you the salt youre the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey youre the only one whos got ta choose
Where to draw the line
Checkmate dont be late
Take another pull
Thats right impossible
When you got to be yourself
Youre the boss of the toss
The dice the price
Grab yourself a slice
Know where to draw the line
