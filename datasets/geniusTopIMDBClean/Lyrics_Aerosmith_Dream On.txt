Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isnt that the way
Everybodys got their dues in life to pay yeah
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know its everybodys sin
You got to lose to know how to win
Half my lifes in books written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know its true
All the things come back to you
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me if its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Dream on dream on dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on dream on dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream on
Dream on
Ah
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me if its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
