Dude  Looks Like a Lady  Lyrics
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
Shes a long lost love at first bite
Baby maybe youre wrong but you know its all right
Thats right
Backstage were having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
Forgive me if I seem out of line
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
Never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Sayin love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus
Lord imagine my surprise
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
So baby let me follow you down  Let me take a peek dear 
Baby let me follow you down  Do me do me do me all night 
Baby let me follow you down  Turn the other cheek dear 
Baby let me follow you down  Do me do me do me do me 
Ooh what a funky lady
Oo she like it like it like it like that
Ooh he was a lady Yeah
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
That that dude looks like a lady
Dude dude dude dude looks like a lady
Dude dude dude dude looks like a lady
Dude dude dude dude looks like a lady
Dude dude dude dude looks like a lady
That that
