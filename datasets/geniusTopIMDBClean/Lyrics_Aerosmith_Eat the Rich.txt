Yeahyeah
Well I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin names kicks back on you then I hope this does the trick
Cause Im sick of your complainin about how many bills
And Im sick of all your bitchin bout your poodles and your pills
And I just cant see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife
Eat the rich theres only one thing theyre very good for
Eat the rich I take one bite now come back for more
Eat the rich I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich I take one bite now spit out the rest uh huh
So I called up my head shrinker and I told him what Id done
He said Youd best go on a diet yeah I hope you have some fun
Anda dont go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
Cause you wont get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food
Now theyre smokin up the junk bonds and then they go get stiff
And theyre dancin in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But theres one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit but go real good with wine
Eat the rich theres only one thing theyre good for
Eat the rich I take one bite now come back for more
Eat the rich I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich I take one bite now spit out the rest uh
Believe in all the good things that money just cant buy
Then you wont get no belly ache from eatin humble pie
I believe in rags to riches your inheritance wont last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend and shove it up your ass
Eat the rich theres only one thing theyre good for
Eat the rich I take one bite now come back for more
Eat the rich I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich I take one bite now spit out the rest
Eat the rich theres only one thing theyre good for
Eat the rich I take one bite now come back for more
Eat the rich dont stop me now Im going crazy
Eat the rich thats my idea of a good time baby
