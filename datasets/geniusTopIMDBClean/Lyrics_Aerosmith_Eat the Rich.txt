Eat the Rich Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Intro]
Yeah-yeah!

[Verse 1]
Well, I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin' about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you, then I hope this does the trick
[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife!

[Chorus]
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're very good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!

[Verse 2]
So I called up my head shrinker, and I told him what I'd done
He said "You'd best go on a diet, yeah I hope you have some fun
And-a don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now they're smokin' up the junk bonds, and then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!

[Chorus]
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh!

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Believe in all the good things that money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache from eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches, your inheritance won't last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend and shove it up your ass!

[Chorus]
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest!
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; don't stop me now I'm going crazy
Eat the rich; that's my idea of a good time baby

[Outro]
