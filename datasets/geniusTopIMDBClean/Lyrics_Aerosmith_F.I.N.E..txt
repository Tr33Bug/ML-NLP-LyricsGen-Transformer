FINE Lyrics
Hot wax dripping
Honey what do you say
I got a brand new record
That Ive got to play
She said not now boy
But I did anyway
And Im ready so ready
Lip smacking paddy whacking
Walking the street
I got a rag top Chevy
Now Im back on my feet
I get an EMHO woody
When I sit in the seat
Because Im ready so ready
Yeah
I got a girlfriend with the hoochycoochy eyes
Because in the pink she look so fine
Shes got the cracker jack now all I wants the prize honey
Heh heh heh
I know these hookers down on 42nd street but
Illgotten bootys not my style
Ill take a rain check until I get back on my feet honey
Heh heh yeah
Because Im
All right
Your daddy says Im
All right
Your mamma says
All right
And my old lady says Im
All right
Whipcracking floozy
Way out of control
She got a new kinda jelly
In her jelly roll
I got the right key baby
But the wrong keyhole
And Im ready so ready
Yeahow

Im a redhot pistol
And Im ready to fight
Im a 38 special
On a Saturday night
Im going to kiss your booboo honey
Make it all right
Because Im ready so ready
Whoo
I got a cruiser with a bimbo on the dash
It kinda keeps my ass in line
One little french kiss honey thats my kinda trash
Yeah
My brand new babys looking fine FINE
The sun is shining everyday
Aint got no rubbers now its raining all the time honey
Whooooee
Says Im
All right
My little sister says Im
All right
Ohh my brother thinks Im
All right
And my old lady knows Im
All right
I feel like Im hung up on the line
Id die for you but we were partners in the crime
Everything about you is so fine FINE
Lets put our clothes back on
And by the way girl
Whats your name again
Uh huh
Come on come on come on come on
Yeah owww
Gggggow
Because Im
All right
Ooo your daddy says Im
All right
Oooh even Tipper thinks Im
Alright
As Joe Perry says Im
All right
Pitched my tent
In the pouring rain
I got a backseat lover
Thats calling my name
She going to blow my cover
Shes hot as a flame
But Im ready so ready
Ow
I shove my tongue
Right between your cheeks
I havent made love now
For twentyfive weeks
I hear that youre so tight
Your loving squeaks
And Im ready so ready
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
