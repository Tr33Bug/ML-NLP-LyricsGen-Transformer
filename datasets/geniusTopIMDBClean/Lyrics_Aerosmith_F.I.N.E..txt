F.I.N.E. Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hot wax dripping
Honey, what do you say
I got a brand new record
That I've got to play
She said not now, boy
But I did anyway
And I'm ready, so ready

Lip smacking paddy whacking
Walking the street
I got a rag top Chevy
Now I'm back on my feet
I get an EM-HO woody
When I sit in the seat
Because I'm ready, so ready
Yeah
I got a girlfriend with the hoochy-coochy eyes
Because in the pink she look so fine
She's got the cracker jack, now all I want's the prize, honey
Heh heh heh
I know these hookers down on 42nd street, but
Ill-gotten booty's not my style
I'll take a rain check until I get back on my feet, honey
Heh heh yeah

[Chorus 1]
Because I'm
All right
Your daddy says I'm
All right
Your mamma says
All right
And my old lady says I'm
All right

[Verse 2]
Whip-cracking floozy
Way out of control
She got a new kinda jelly
In her jelly roll
I got the right key, baby
But the wrong keyhole
And I'm ready, so ready
Yeah-ow
You might also likeI'm a red-hot pistol
And I'm ready to fight
I'm a .38 special
On a Saturday night
I'm going to kiss your boo-boo, honey
Make it all right
Because I'm ready, so ready
Whoo

I got a cruiser with a bimbo on the dash
It kinda keeps my ass in line
One little french kiss, honey, that's my kinda trash
Yeah

My brand new baby's looking f-i-n-e, FINE
The sun is shining everyday
Ain't got no rubbers, now it's raining all the time, honey
Whooooee

[Chorus 2]
Says I'm
All right
My little sister says I'm
All right
Ohh, my brother thinks I'm
All right
And my old lady knows I'm
All right
[Verse 3]
I feel like I'm hung up on the line
I'd die for you, but we were partners in the crime
Everything about you is so f-i-n-e, FINE
Let's put our clothes back on
And by the way, girl
What's your name again?
Uh huh
Come on come on come on come on
Yeah, owww
[Tyler sounds] G-g-g-g-gow

[Chorus 3]
Because I'm
All right
Ooo, your daddy says I'm
All right
Oooh, even Tipper thinks I'm
Alright
As Joe Perry says, I'm
All right

[Verse 4]
Pitched my tent
In the pouring rain
I got a back-seat lover
That's calling my name
She going to blow my cover
She's hot as a flame
But I'm ready, so ready
Ow!

I shove my tongue
Right between your cheeks
I haven't made love now
For twenty-five weeks
I hear that you're so tight
Your loving squeaks
And I'm ready, so ready
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
