Falling in Love  Is Hard on the Knees  Lyrics
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
You think youre in love
Like its a real sure thing
But every time you fall
You get your ass in a sling
You used to be strong
But now its ooh baby please
Because falling in love is so hard on the knees
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
We was making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol cupid he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone elses name
Yeah
There aint gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it aint one of these
Youre bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
Chip off the old block
Man youre so much like your sister
My fantasizin must be outta luck
My old libido has been blowin a transistor
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck yeah


Im jonesing on love
Yeah I got the DTs
You say that we will
But there aint no guarantees
Im major in love
But in all minor keys
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
Yeah
What are you looking for
Its got to be hardcore
Must be some kind of nouveau riche
Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Lets get you on a tighter leash
Own it own it own it
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
Youre so bad youre so bad youre so
You aint that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes Im good but when Im bad
Im even better
Dont give me no lip
Ive got enough of my own
There aint gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it aint one of these
Youre bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees
Im jonesing on love
Yeah I got the DTs
You say that we will
But there aint no guarantees
Im major in love
But in all minor keys
Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
