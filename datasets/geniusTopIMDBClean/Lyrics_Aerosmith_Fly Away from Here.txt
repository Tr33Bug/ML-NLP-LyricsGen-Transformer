Fly Away from Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
We gotta find a way
Yeah, I can't wait another day
Ain't nothing gonna change
If we stay around here
Gotta do what it takes
Goes on in our hands
We all make mistakes
Yeah, but it's never too late to start again
Take another breath and say another prayer
[Chorus]
And then fly away from here
Anywhere, yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly, yeah

[Verse 2]
If this life?
It seems harder now
It ain't no never mind
You got me by your side
And anytime you want
Yeah, we can catch a train and find a better place, yeah
'Cause we won't let nothing or no one keep getting us down
Maybe you and I could pack our bags and hit the sky

[Chorus]
And fly away from here
Anywhere, yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly

Do you see a bluer sky now?
You can have a better life now
Open your eyes
'Cause no one here can ever stop us
They can try but we won't let them
No way
Maybe you and I
Could pack our bags and say goodbye

[Chorus]
And fly away from here
Anywhere, honey, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Fly away from here
Yeah, anywhere, honey, I don't, I don't, I don't
Yeah, we just fly away3Embed
