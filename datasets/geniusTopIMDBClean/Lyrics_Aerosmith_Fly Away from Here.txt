We gotta find a way
Yeah I cant wait another day
Aint nothing gonna change
If we stay around here
Gotta do what it takes
Goes on in our hands
We all make mistakes
Yeah but its never too late to start again
Take another breath and say another prayer
And then fly away from here
Anywhere yeah I dont care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Wont let time pass us by
Well just fly yeah
If this life
It seems harder now
It aint no never mind
You got me by your side
And anytime you want
Yeah we can catch a train and find a better place yeah
Cause we wont let nothing or no one keep getting us down
Maybe you and I could pack our bags and hit the sky
And fly away from here
Anywhere yeah I dont care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Wont let time pass us by
Well just fly
Do you see a bluer sky now
You can have a better life now
Open your eyes
Cause no one here can ever stop us
They can try but we wont let them
No way
Maybe you and I
Could pack our bags and say goodbye
And fly away from here
Anywhere honey I dont care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Fly away from here
Yeah anywhere honey I dont I dont I dont
Yeah we just fly away
