Me old my lady sitting in the shade
Talking about the money that I aint made
Singing o boy dont you line the
Track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
O boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
If I could I surely would
Stand on the rock that Moses stood
Singing o boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
O boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
Drank so much hooch
It made my eyes be getting blurry
They say I nailed her to the wall
A stitch in time dont mean a thing
No hangman jury could make me crawl
Cause Im a poor boy
O boy dont you line the track
O boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
What you do with the gun thats loaded
Shot her dead when your heart exploded
Tell me baby now ddontcha worry
Like lyin to the hangman jury
I swear I didnt know that 45 was loaded
In fact my memory aint too clear
Thats not to say she didnt get what she deserved
Least thats the way it look from here
Boy when you line the track a lack a
Hey boy dont you line the track


Oh a love come tumblin down
Oh a love come tumblin down
Oh  Lets get outta here 
When a love come tumblin
And every night she take her thing
Into the city and in the mornin make me beg
Cause If Id taken all her real titty gritty
Id smack her right upside the head boy
O boy dont you line the track
O boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
Oh when love come tumblin down
Oh when love come tumblin down
Oh when love come tumblin
Poor boy sweating in the hot summer night
Hangman waitin for the early morning light
Singing hey boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
O boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
If I could I surely would
Stand on the rock that Moses done stood
Singing o boy dont you line the track a lack a
O boy dont you line the track
