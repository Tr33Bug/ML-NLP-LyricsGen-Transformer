Im down a one way street
With a one night stand
With a one track mind
Out in no mans land
The punishment sometimes
Dont seem to fit the crime
Yeah theres a hole in my soul
But one thing I learned
For every love letter written
Is another one burned
So you tell me how its gonna be this time
Is it over
Is it over
Cause Im blowing out the flame
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find theres nothing there girl
Yeah I swear Im telling you girl yeah cause
Theres a hole in my soul thats been killing me forever
Its a place where a garden never grows
Theres a hole in my soul yeah I should have known better
Cause your loves like a thorn without a rose
Yeah yeeeaaahhhh
Im as dry as a sevenyear drought
I got dust for tears
And Im all tapped out
Sometimes I feel broke cant get fixed
I know theres been all kinds of shoes
Underneath your bed
Now I sleep with my boots on
But youre still in my head
Something tells me this time
Im down to my last licks
Cause if its over
Then its over
And its driving me insane
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find theres nothing there
Girl yeah I swear Im telling you girl yeah cause
Theres a hole in my soul thats been killing me forever
Its a place where a garden never grows
Theres a hole in my soul yeah I should have known better
Cause your loves like a thorn without a rose
Yeah yeah
Yeah
Yeah is it over
Yeah its over
And Im blowing out the flame
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find theres nothing there girl
Yeah I swear Im telling you girl yeah cause
Theres a hole in my soul thats been killing me forever
Its a place where a garden never grows
Theres a hole in my soul yeah I should have known better
Cause your loves like a thorn without a rose
Yeah yeah
Yeahy yeah
Good night Taj good night Chelsea cha
