I Donâ€™t Want to Miss a Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
[Verse 2]
Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever

[Chorus]
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

[Bridge]
I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah!

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

[Chorus]
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

[Outro]
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah
I don't wanna miss a thing43Embed
