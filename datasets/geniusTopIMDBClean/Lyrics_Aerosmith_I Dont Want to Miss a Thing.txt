I could stay awake just to hear you breathin
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While youre far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
Dont wanna close my eyes
I dont wanna fall asleep
Cause Id miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you  Even when I dream 
The sweetest dream would never do
Id still miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And Im wondering what youre dreaming
Wonderin if its me youre seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God were together
And I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever
I dont wanna close my eyes
I dont wanna fall asleep
Cause Id miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you  Even when I dream 
The sweetest dream would never do
Id still miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
I dont wanna miss one smile
I dont wanna miss one kiss
Well I just wanna be with you
Right here with you just like this
I just wanna hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah  Yeah 
Yeah  Yeah 
Yeah


Dont wanna close my eyes
Dont wanna fall asleep
Cause Id miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you  Even when I dream 
The sweetest dream would never do
Id still miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
I dont wanna close my eyes
I dont wanna fall asleep
Cause Id miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
Id still miss you babe
And I dont wanna miss a thing
Dont wanna close my eyes
I dont wanna fall asleep yeah
I dont wanna miss a thing
