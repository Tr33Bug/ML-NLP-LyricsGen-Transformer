Hey jjjaded
You got your mamas style
But youre yesterdays child to me
So jaded
You think thats where its at
But is that where its supposed to be
Youre getting it all over me exrated
My my baby blue
Yeah I been thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah youre so jaded
And Im the one that jaded you
Hey jjjaded
In all its misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
Were thinking of
Well slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded
My my baby blue
Yeah Im thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah Im so jaded
And baby Im afraid of you
Your thinkings so complicated
Ive had it all up to here
But its so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldnt trade it
Love me jaded
Hey jjjaded
There aint no baby please
When Im shooting the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasys what you prefer

Jaded  Baby 
Youre so jaded
