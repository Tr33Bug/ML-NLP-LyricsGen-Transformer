Youre getting it all over me exrated
My my baby blue
Yeah I been thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah youre so jaded
And Im the one that jaded you
Hey jjjaded
In all its misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
Were thinking of
Well slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded
My my baby blue
Yeah Im thinking about you
My my baby blue
Yeah Im so jaded
And baby Im afraid of you
Your thinkings so complicated
Ive had it all up to here
But its so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldnt trade it
Love me jaded
