Jaded Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, j-j-jaded
You got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be?
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you
[Verse 2]
Hey, j-j-jaded
In all its misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm so jaded
And baby, I'm afraid of you

[Verse 3]
Your thinking's so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded

Hey, j-j-jaded
There ain't no baby, please
When I'm shooting the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
I'ma talking 'bout you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I've been thinking 'bout you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded (Baby)
Jaded (Baby)
You're so jaded
'Cause I'm the one that jaded you12Embed
