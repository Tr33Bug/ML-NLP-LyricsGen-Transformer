She gave you a flower the one that God gave her
You all up in the KoolAid but you do not know the flavor
Get into the zone baby and do yourself a favor
Head down spin around get a little refried
If that dont get it you can catch it on the Bside
Just push play ing A
Just push play theyre gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play ing A
Just push play were comin at you anyway
Sweet leaf dreamer you been smokin up the ganja
Damned if you do yeah but dont get any on you
Kicking off the cashmere putting on the kasbah
Its a kiss a diss and trade it for a coo hah
Just push play ing A
Just push play theyre gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play ing A
Just push play were comin at you anyway
Instead of growin old all dapper and neat
Im gon grow my hair right down to my feet
It is you and me baby no pimpdaddy Jack
Its Cadillac wack no Cadillac whackback
Just push play ing A
Just push play theyre gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play ing A
Just push play were comin at you anyway


ing A theyre gonna bleep it anyway
Walk this way were comin at you anyway
Just push play fucking A
Just push play theyre going  it anyway
Sil vous plait fucking A
Just push play were comin at you anyway
Tell me what I say walk this way
Fucking A were comin at you anyways
