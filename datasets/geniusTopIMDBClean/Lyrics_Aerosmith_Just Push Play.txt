Just Push Play Lyrics[Verse 1]
She gave you a flower, the one that God gave her
You all up in the Kool-Aid, but you do not know the flavor
Get into the zone, baby, and do yourself a favor
Head down, spin around, get a little refried
If that don't get it, you can catch it on the B-side

[Chorus]
Just push play, -ing A
Just push play, they're gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play, -ing A
Just push play, we're comin' at you anyway
[Verse 2]
Sweet leaf dreamer, you been smokin' up the ganja
Damned if you do, yeah, but don't get any on you
Kicking off the cashmere, putting on the kasbah
It's a kiss, a diss, and trade it for a coo hah

[Chorus]
Just push play, -ing A
Just push play, they're gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play, -ing A
Just push play, we're comin' at you anyway

[Verse 3]
Instead of growin' old, all dapper and neat
I'm gon' grow my hair right down to my feet
It is you and me, baby, no pimp-daddy Jack
It's Cadillac wack, no Cadillac whack-back

[Chorus]
Just push play, -ing A
Just push play, they're gonna bleep it anyway
Just push play, -ing A
Just push play, we're comin' at you anyway

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Chorus]
-ing A, they're gonna bleep it anyway
Walk this way, we're comin' at you anyway
Just push play, fucking A
Just push play, they're going -- it anyway

[Outro]
S'il vous plait, fucking A
Just push play, we're comin' at you anyway
Tell me what I say, walk this way
Fucking A, we're comin' at you anyways1Embed
