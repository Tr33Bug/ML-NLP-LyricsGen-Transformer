Long ago in days untold
Were ruled by Lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold
They dared to bare their wombs that bleed
Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossing turning nightmares burning dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships the Viking spits the blood of fathers land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply they died
Screams of no reply and died
Lordy lordy and then then they died
Lordy no then they died
Live and do or die
Long ago were days I toldLord they died
Kings and queens and guillotines
Live and no reply they died
Long ago were days I told
Kings and queens and guillotines
