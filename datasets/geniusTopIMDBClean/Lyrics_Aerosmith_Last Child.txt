Last Child Lyrics[Intro]
I'm dreaming tonight, I'm living back home
Right
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down 'cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Can't stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nitty-gritty
[Verse 2]
Yes, sir, no, sir
Don't come close to my
Home sweet home
Can't catch no dose
Of my hot tail poontang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J. Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer

[Chorus]
Home sweet home

[Verse 3]
Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma, she's a-cooking
Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto

[Verse 4]
Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It ain't no good when bossman's
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When you're rocking the street
You might also like[Chorus]
Home sweet home
Mama, take me home sweet home

[Outro]
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street
I was the last child
I'm just a punk in the street1Embed
