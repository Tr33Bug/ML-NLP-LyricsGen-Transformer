Im dreaming tonight Im living back home
Right
Yeah yeah
Take me back to a south Tallahassee
Down cross the bridge to my sweet sassafrassy
Cant stand up on my feet in the city
Got to get back to the real nittygritty
Yes sir no sir
Dont come close to my
Home sweet home
Cant catch no dose
Of my hot tail poontang sweetheart
Sweathog ready to make a silk purse
From a J Paul Getty and his ear
With her face in her beer
Home sweet home
Get out in the field
Put the mule in the stable
Ma shes acooking
Put the eats on the table
Hates in the city
And my loves in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto
Stand up sit down
Dont do nothing
It aint no good when bossmans
Stuffing it down their throats
For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet
When youre rocking the street


Home sweet home
Mama take me home sweet home
I was the last child
Im just a punk in the street
I was the last child
Im just a punk in the street
