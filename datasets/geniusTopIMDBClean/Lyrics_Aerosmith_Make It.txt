Good evening people welcome to the show
Got something here I want you all to know
When life and people bring on primal screams
You got to think of
What its going to take to make your dreams
Make It
Dont break it
I said make It
Dont break it
If you do then you feel like the worlds coming down on you
You know that history repeats itself
What you just done so has somebody else
You know you do youve got to think up fast
Youve got to figure what its going to take to make it last
Make It
Dont break it
I said make It
Dont break it
If you do then you feel like the worlds coming down on you
Better weather pull yourself together
Dont be catching the blues
Better weather pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
Youre only paying your dues
Dues is the price that you gotta pay
And if you dont theyll get you anyway
Although you know what youve been going through
Youre on the brink so think what it takes to


Make It
Dont break it
I said make It
Dont break it
If you do then you feel like the worlds coming down on you
Better weather pull yourself together
Dont be catching the blues
Better weather pull yourself together
What have you got to lose
