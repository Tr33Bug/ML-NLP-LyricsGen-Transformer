It aint easy living like a gypsy
Tell you honey how I feel
Ive been dreaming floating down the stream and
Losing touch with all thats real
Whole earth lover keeping undercover
Never know where youve been
Youve been fading always out parading
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Well youve always got your tail on the wag
Shooting fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out because someday soon
Youll have to climb back on the wagon
It isnt easy living like you wanna
Its so hard to find peace of mind yes it is
The way I see it youve got to say shit
But dont forget to drop me a line
Said youre bald as an egg when youre eighteen
And working for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mind with your dreams
You better check it out
Or someday soon youll have to
Climb back on the wagon
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where youve gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
Tell her where youve gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
It isnt easy living like you wanna
Its so hard to find peace of mind yes it is
The way I see it youve got to say shit
But dont forget to drop me a line
Said youre bald as an egg when youre eighteen
Working for your dad is just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with your dreams
You better check it out
Because someday soon youll have to
Climb back on the wagon
Keeping up Mama Kin
Tell her where youve gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with Mama Kin
I said Ill tell her where youve gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
