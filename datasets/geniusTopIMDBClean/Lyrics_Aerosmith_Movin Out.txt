We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live aint a soul around
People startin comin
All we do is just agrin
Said weve got to move out
Cause the citys moving in
I said weve got to move out
Cause the citys moving in
Tell me who you know
And Ill tell you who too
Go see my friend and hell set you free
Tell me what you need and
Maybe I can go too
No one knows the way but maybe me
Nobody knows where nobody shows where
Nobody knows where you can find me yeah
Good morning glory Hallelujah to you
What is the story Whats been going through you
Living like a king off the fat of the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band
Were moving were getting out
Were moving without a doubt
Were moving were going far
Were moving oh yes we are
Cause nobody goes there
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me
Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me ah
Oh Lordy Lordy Lordy
Level with God
And youre in tune with the universe
Talk with yourself
And youll hear what you want to know
Got to rise above
Because below its only getting worse
Life in time
Will take you where you want to go
Where you want to go
Where you want to go
Where are you going
Where are you going
Where are you going
Ah ah ah ah ah
Good morning glory Hallelujah to you
What is the story Whats been going through you
Living like a king off the fat of the land
Working like a dog in a rock and roll band
Were moving were getting out
Were moving without a doubt
Were moving were going far
Were moving oh yes we are
Nobody goes there
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me
Nobody knows where
Nobody shows where
Nobody goes where you can find me
We all live on the edge of town
Where we all live aint a soul around
People startin comin
All we do is just agrin
Said weve got to move out
Cause the citys moving in
I said weve got to move out
Cause the citys moving in
