Blood stains the ivories
Of my daddys baby grand
I aint seen no daylight
Since we started this band
No more no more
No more no more
Store bought clothes
Falling part at the seams
Tea leaf reading gypsies
Fortune telling my dreams
No more no more
No more no more
Holiday Inn lock the door with a chain
You love it and you hate it
But to me theyre all the same
No more no more
No more no more
Baby Im a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Stalemate jailbait
Ladies cant refuse
You love them then you leave them
With your sold out reviews
No more no more
No more no more


Sweet talking barroom ladies disease
Slipping with her lips
Sliding down your knees
No more no more
No more no more
No more no more
Lived my life a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby Im a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me its old fashioned
Times theyre a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I stop changing
Ill be writing out my will
Its the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill
Babe Im a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
