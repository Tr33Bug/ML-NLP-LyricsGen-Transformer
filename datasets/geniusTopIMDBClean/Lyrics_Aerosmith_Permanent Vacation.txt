Permanent Vacation Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a letter from a friend the other morning
He say it's hot down in Montego Bay
I got the point and now I think it's finally dawning
Yeah, yeah, I got to get away
I got to take myself a permanent vacation
The sky's the limit but my plane won't fly
My nose is clean and lordie don't need no sedation
Yeah, yeah, and that's the reason why

[Chorus]
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez
I want a tan where the sun, it never shines
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez
You best believe it that I go to get away
[Verse 2]
I got a sister man she really got a pinhead
She think she kinky but she can't get straight
She say she livin' but I kinda think she's brain dead
Just excess baggage on a late night freight

[Chorus]
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez
I want a tan where the sun, it never shines
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez
You best believe it that I go to get away

[Verse 3]
I got to take me on a permanent vacation
The girl's be cumming down in Cayman Brack
I got to hand it to a firm situation
Yeah, yeah, I got to cut me some slack

[Chorus]
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez
I want a tan where the sun, it never shines
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez
You best believe it that I go to get awayYou might also like1Embed
