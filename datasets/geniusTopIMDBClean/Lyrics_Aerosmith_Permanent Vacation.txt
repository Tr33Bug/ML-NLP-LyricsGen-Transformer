I got a letter from a friend the other morning
He say its hot down in Montego Bay
I got the point and now I think its finally dawning
Yeah yeah I got to get away
I got to take myself a permanent vacation
The skys the limit but my plane wont fly
My nose is clean and lordie dont need no sedation
Yeah yeah and thats the reason why
I really need it really really need St Tropez
I want a tan where the sun it never shines
I really need it really really need St Tropez
You best believe it that I go to get away
I got a sister man she really got a pinhead
She think she kinky but she cant get straight
She say she livin but I kinda think shes brain dead
Just excess baggage on a late night freight
I really need it really really need St Tropez
I want a tan where the sun it never shines
I really need it really really need St Tropez
You best believe it that I go to get away
I got to take me on a permanent vacation
The girls be cumming down in Cayman Brack
I got to hand it to a firm situation
Yeah yeah I got to cut me some slack
I really need it really really need St Tropez
I want a tan where the sun it never shines
I really need it really really need St Tropez
You best believe it that I go to get away
