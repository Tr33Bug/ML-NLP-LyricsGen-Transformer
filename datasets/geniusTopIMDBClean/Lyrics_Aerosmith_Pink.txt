Pink its my new obsession yeah
Pink its not even a question
Pink on the lips of your lover  ooo 
Cause pink is the love you discover
Pink as the bing on your cherry
Pink cause you are so very
Pink its the color of passion
Cause today it just goes with the fashion
Pink it was love at first sight
Yeah pink when I turn out the light
And pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
You could be my flamingo
Cause pink is the new kinda lingo
Pink like a deco umbrella
Yeah its kink but you dont ever tell her yeah
Pink it was love at first sight
Yeah pink when I turn out the light
Yeah pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
Ahhhhhh yeah
Ahhhhhh yeah
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh
I want to be your lover
I want to wrap you in rubber
As pink as the sheets that we lay on
Cause pink its my favorite crayon yeah
Pink it was love at first sight
Yeah Pink when I turn out the light
Yeah pink its like red but not quite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight
