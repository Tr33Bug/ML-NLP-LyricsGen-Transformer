Pink Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pink, it's my new obsession, yeah
Pink, it's not even a question
Pink on the lips of your lover (ooo)
'Cause pink is the love you discover

[Verse 2]
Pink, as the bing on your cherry
Pink, 'cause you are so very
Pink, it's the color of passion
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion
[Chorus]
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
And pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight

[Verse 3]
You could be my flamingo
'Cause pink is the new kinda lingo
Pink, like a deco umbrella
Yeah, it's kink, but you don't ever tell her, yeah

[Chorus]
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah, pink when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink gets me high as a kite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight

[Bridge]
Ahhhhhh, yeah
Ahhhhhh, yeah
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 4]
I... want to be your lover
I... want to wrap you in rubber
As pink as the sheets that we lay on
'Cause pink, it's my favorite crayon, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Pink, it was love at first sight
Yeah! Pink when I turn out the light
Yeah, pink, it's like red but not quite
And I think everything is going to be all right
No matter what we do tonight5Embed
