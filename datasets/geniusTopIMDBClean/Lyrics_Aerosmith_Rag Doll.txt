Rag Doll Lyrics[Chorus 1]
Rag Doll living in a movie
Hot tramp Daddy's little cutie
You're so fine they'll never see you leaving by the back door, man
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby won't you do me like you done before

[Verse]
I'm feeling like a bad boy
Mmm just a like a bad boy
I'm ripping up a Rag Doll
Like throwing away an old toy
Some babe's talking real loud
Talking all about the new crowd
Try and tell me of an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shuffling in a shoe shine
Old tin lizzy do it until you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery
[Chorus 1]
Rag Doll living in a movie
Hot tramp Daddy's little cutie
You're so fine they'll never see you leaving by the back door, man
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby won't you do me like you done before

[Chorus 2]
Yes I'm moving
Yes I'm moving
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes I'm moving
Yes I'm moving
Old tin lizzy do it until you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

[Chorus 1]
Rag Doll living in a movie
Hot tramp Daddy's little cutie
You're so fine they'll never see you leaving by the back door, man
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby won't you do me like you done before
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Yes I'm moving
Yes I'm moving
Get ready for the big time
Get crazy on the moonshine
Yes I'm moving
I'm really moving
Sloe gin fizzy, do it until you're dizzy
Give it all you got until you're put out of your misery

[Chorus 1]
Rag Doll living in a movie
Hot tramp Daddy's little cutie
You're so fine they'll never see you leaving by the back door, man
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby won't you do me like you done before

Rag Doll living in a movie

You're so fine they'll never see you leaving by the back door, man
Hot time get it while it's easy
Don't mind come on up and see me
