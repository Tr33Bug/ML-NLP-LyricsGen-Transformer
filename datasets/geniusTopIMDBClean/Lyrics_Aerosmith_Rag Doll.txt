Rag Doll living in a movie
Hot tramp Daddys little cutie
Youre so fine theyll never see you leaving by the back door man
Hot time get it while its easy
Dont mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby wont you do me like you done before
Im feeling like a bad boy
Mmm just a like a bad boy
Im ripping up a Rag Doll
Like throwing away an old toy
Some babes talking real loud
Talking all about the new crowd
Try and tell me of an old dream
A new version of the old scene
Speak easy on the grape vine
Keep shuffling in a shoe shine
Old tin lizzy do it until youre dizzy
Give it all you got until youre put out of your misery

Hot time get it while its easy
Dont mind come on up and see me
Rag Doll baby wont you do me like you done before
Yes Im moving
Yes Im moving
Get ready for the big time
Tap dancing on a land mine
Yes Im moving
Yes Im moving
Old tin lizzy do it until youre dizzy
Give it all you got until youre put out of your misery

Sloe gin fizzy do it until youre dizzy
Give it all you got until youre put out of your misery
