Remember  Walking in the Sand  Lyrics
Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away cross the sea
Its been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
It said that we was through
She found somebody new
Oh let me think let me think
What shall I do
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no
Remember walking in the sand
Remember walking hand in hand
Remember the night was so exciting
Remember her smile was so inviting
Remember then she touched my cheek
Remember with her fingertips
Remember softly
Softly we met with a kiss
Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew
The girl that said shed been true
Oh whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you
What will I do with it now
Oh
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no no no no no
Remember walking in the sand
Remember walking hand in hand
Remember the night was so exciting
Remember her smile was so inviting
Remember then she touched my cheek
Remember with her fingertips
Remember softly
Softly we met with a kiss
Whatever happened to
The girl that I once knew
The girl that said shed been true
Oh whatever happened to
That night I gave it to you
What will I do with it now
Oh
