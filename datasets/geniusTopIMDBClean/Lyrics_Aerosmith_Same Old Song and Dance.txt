Get yourself a cooler lay yourself low
Coincidental murder with nothing to show
With the judge constipation will go to his head
And his wifes aggravation youre soon enough dead
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend
Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun
No smoothface lawyer to get you undone
Say love aint the same on the south side of town
You could look but you aint gonna find it around
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend  Uh 
Its the same old story same old story same old song and dance
Fate comes aknocking doors start locking
Your old time connection change your direction
You aint gonna change it cant rearrange it
Cant stand the pain when its all the same to you my friend
When youre low down and dirty from walking the street
With your old hurdygurdy no one to meet
Say love aint the same on the south side of town
You could look but you aint gonna find it around
Its the same old story same old song and dance my friend
Its the same old story same old story same old song and dance yeah
