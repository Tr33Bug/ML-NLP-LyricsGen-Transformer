Loosehearted lady sleepy was she
Love for the devil brought her to me
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in
Oh woe is me I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail
Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs that bay at the moon
My ship leaves in the midnight
Cant say Ill be back too soon
They awaken far far away
Heat of my candle show me the way
Seeds of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holding me in
Oh woe is me I feel so badly for you
Oh woe is me I feel so sadly for you in time
Bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail
