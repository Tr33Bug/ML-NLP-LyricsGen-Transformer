Shut Up and Dance Lyrics[Chorus]
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

A love has got a-me down
A tear just hit a-the ground
So I started writing you this song
But the words I wrote came out all wrong
Yeah, but it's all right

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance
When you can't define a-the crime
A-then life ain't worth a dime
When they take away everything you got
And they rub your nose in the funky spot
Not without a fight

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

When you work your fingers to the bone
Now what does that get you - nothing
In a crowd of people
You're still alone
You hope that tells you something
The road to heaven is paved in hell
And it makes you wonder
Why we're here at all

Check out the shape of your circumstance
He wears the dress and she wears the pants
Here comes Jill and she needs romance
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!

Sex is like a gun
You aim, you shoot, you run
When you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean
It's like gettin' head from a guillotine
And the night has just begun
You might also likeTalk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and dance

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance
Don't get deep, shut up and danceEmbed
