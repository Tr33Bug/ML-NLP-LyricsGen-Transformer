Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
A love has got ame down
A tear just hit athe ground
So I started writing you this song
But the words I wrote came out all wrong
Yeah but its all right
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
When you cant define athe crime
Athen life aint worth a dime
When they take away everything you got
And they rub your nose in the funky spot
Not without a fight
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
When you work your fingers to the bone
Now what does that get you  nothing
In a crowd of people
Youre still alone
You hope that tells you something
The road to heaven is paved in hell
And it makes you wonder
Why were here at all
Check out the shape of your circumstance
He wears the dress and she wears the pants
Here comes Jill and she needs romance
But you cant do jack so shut up and dance
Sex is like a gun
You aim you shoot you run
When youre splittin hairs with Mr Clean
Its like gettin head from a guillotine
And the night has just begun
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
Talk is cheap shut up and dance
Dont get deep shut up and dance
