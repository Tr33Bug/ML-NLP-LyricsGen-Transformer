Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
Youre calling my name but I got to make clear
I cant say baby where Ill be in a year
Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go musta got up and went
Well I got good news shes a real good liar
Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
Youre telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You cant catch me because the rabbit done died yes it did
You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
Ill take you backstage you can drink from my glass
Ill talk about something youre sure to understand
Cause a month on the road and Ill be eating from your hand
