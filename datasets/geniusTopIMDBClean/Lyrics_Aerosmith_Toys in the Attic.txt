In the attic lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Reals the dream
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Reals the dream
Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
Lights
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Reals the dream
Leaving the things that are real behind
Leaving the things that you love from mind
All of the things that you learned from fears
Nothing is left for the years
Voices scream
Nothing seen
Reals the dream


Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys were in the attic
Toys toys toys were in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
Toys toys toys in the attic
