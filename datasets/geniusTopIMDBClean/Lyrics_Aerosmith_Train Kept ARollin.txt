Train Kept A-Rollinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, on a train, I met a dame
She rather handsome, we kinda looked the same
She was pretty, from New York City
I'm walking down that old fair lane
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so

[Chorus 1]
I said, train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
With a "heave!", and a ho!
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no
[Chorus 2]
Well, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her so, no, no, no

[Verse 2]

On your way, get along, sweet little woman get along
On your way
I'm in heat, I'm in love

Well, we made a stop in Albuquerque
She must have thought I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train, and put her hands up
Looking so good I couldn't let her go
But I just couldn't tell her so

[Outro]
I said, train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
Train kept a-rolling all night long
I'm in heat, I'm in love
But I just couldn't tell her1Embed
