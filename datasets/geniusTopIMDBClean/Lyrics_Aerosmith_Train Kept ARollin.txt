Well on a train I met a dame
She rather handsome we kinda looked the same
She was pretty from New York City
Im walking down that old fair lane
Im in heat Im in love
But I just couldnt tell her so
I said train kept arolling all night long
Train kept arolling all night long
Train kept arolling all night long
Train kept arolling all night long
With a heave and a ho
But I just couldnt tell her so no no no
Well get along sweet little woman get along
On your way get along sweet little woman get along
On your way
Im in heat Im in love
But I just couldnt tell her so no no no

Well we made a stop in Albuquerque
She must have thought I was a real cool jerk
Got off the train and put her hands up
Looking so good I couldnt let her go
But I just couldnt tell her so
I said train kept arolling all night long
Train kept arolling all night long
Train kept arolling all night long
Train kept arolling all night long
Im in heat Im in love
