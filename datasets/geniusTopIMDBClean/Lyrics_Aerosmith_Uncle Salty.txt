Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead
Her mammy was lusted Daddy he was busted
They left her to be trusted til the orphan bleeds
But when she cried at night no one came
And when she cried at night went insane
Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby
That shed get by and maybe someday shed see
But soon she found her mothers love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead
But when she cried at night no one came
And when she cried at night went insane ow
Ooh its a sunny day outside my window
Ooh its a sunny day outside my window
Ooh oh yeah
Ooh oh yeah yeah yeah
Now shes doing any for money and a penny
A sailor with a penny or two or three
Hers is the cunning for men who come arunning
They all come for fun and it seems to me
That when she cried at night no one came
And when she cried at night went insane
Ooh its a sunny day outside my window
