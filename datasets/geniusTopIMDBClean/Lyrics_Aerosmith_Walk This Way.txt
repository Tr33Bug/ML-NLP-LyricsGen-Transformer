Backstroking lover always hiding neath the covers
Til I talked to my daddy he say
He said You aint seen nothing til youre down on a muffin
Then youre sure to be achanging your ways
I met a cheerleader was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss like this
Seesaw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing Hey diddlediddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didnt care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasnt me she was fooling cause she knew what she was doing
When she told me how to walk this way she told me to
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way talk this way
Ah just give me a kiss
Like this
Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirts climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady
Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss like this
Seesaw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing Hey diddlediddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didnt care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasnt me she was fooling cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way walk this way
Walk this way talk this way
Just give me a kiss
