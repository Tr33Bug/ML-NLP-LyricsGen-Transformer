Mary Mac all dressed in black
Silver buttons up and down her back
High low tipsy toe
She broke a needle now she cant sew
Walkin the dog
Im just walkin your dog
Well if you dont know how to do it
Ill show you how to walk the dog
Ask my mama for 15 cents
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high it touched the sky
Didnt come back til the 4th of July
Walkin the dog
Im just walkin your dog
Well if you dont know how to do it
Ill show you how to walk the dog
Ha uh ha uh
Uh uh uh uh
Mary Mary quite contrary
How does your garden grow
Well well silver bells and little bitty bitty white shells
Pretty maids all in a row
Walkin your dog
Im just walkin your dog
Well if you dont know how to do it
Ill show you how to walk the dog
Well if you dont know how to do it
Ill show you how to walk the dog
Well if you dont know how to do it
Ill show you how to walk the dog
