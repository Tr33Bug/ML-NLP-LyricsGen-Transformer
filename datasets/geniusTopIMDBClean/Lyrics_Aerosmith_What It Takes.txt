What It Takes Lyrics[Intro]
Ooooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
There goes my old girlfriend
There's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises?
I guess they don't mean a thing
So, baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back
I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire
But now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street
Like you didn't miss a beat, yeah
[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Girl, before I met you
I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner
Yeah, my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money
Then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Aw, guitar!

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my loving didn't mean that much
Tell me you aren't dying when you're crying for me

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go (Ooh)
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go (Oh yeah)
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice

[Outro]
Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice
No, no, no, no, 'cause I don't want to burn in paradise
Ooo
Let go, let go, let go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't want to burn, I don't want to burn
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go[repeat]
