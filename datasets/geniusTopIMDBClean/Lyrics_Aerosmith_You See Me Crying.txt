You see me crying
Dont let it get you down
You see me crying
Im back to the lost and found
Honey what you done to your head
Honey was the words I said
Honey what you done to your head
Honey was the words I said
You see me crying
Say youre a ladies man
You see me crying
So hard to understand
Honey what you done to your head
Honey was the words I said
Honey what you done to your head
Honey was the words I said
You see me crying
Please say youll stick around
And I got to be your lover
Let me take you to town
And Ill show you everything around
And Im never gonna let you down
Cause my love is like a merry go round
Honey what you done to your head
Honey was the words I said
Honey what you done to your head
Honey was the words I said
