Ballad of Dwight Fry Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
Mommy, where's daddy?
He's been gone for so long
Do you think he'll ever come home?

[Verse 1]
I was gone for fourteen days
I could've been gone for more
Held up in the intensive care ward
Lyin' on the floor
I was gone for all those days
But I, was not all alone
I made friends with a lot of people
In the danger zone
[Chorus]
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Since I've gone away

[Verse 2]
I think I lost some weight there
And I, I'm sure I need some rest
Sleepin' don't come very easy
In a straight white vest
Sure'd like to see that little children
She's only four years old... old
I'd give her back all of her playthings
Even, even the ones I stole

[Chorus]
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone insane

[Bridge]
I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here
I, I gotta get out of here
I, I gotta get out of here
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere
Ya gotta let me out of here
Let me outta here
(Incoherent rambling shouts continue and fade as next verse starts)

See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Blown up in my face

[Instrumental break 3:56-4:55]

[Verse 3]
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat
And I, I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there
I guess he couldn't breathe
Said to myself this is very strange
I'm glad it wasn't me
But now I hear those sirens callin'
And so I am not free
I didn't want to be
I didn't want to be
I didn't want to be

[Chorus]
See my lonely life unfold
(I didn't want to be)
I see it every day
(Leave me alone
I didn't want to be
Don't touch me!)
See my lonely mind explode
When I've gone Insane1Embed
