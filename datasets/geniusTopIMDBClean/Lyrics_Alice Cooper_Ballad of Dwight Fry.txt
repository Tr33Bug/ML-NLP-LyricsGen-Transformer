Mommy wheres daddy
Hes been gone for so long
Do you think hell ever come home
I was gone for fourteen days
I couldve been gone for more
Held up in the intensive care ward
Lyin on the floor
I was gone for all those days
But I was not all alone
I made friends with a lot of people
In the danger zone
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Since Ive gone away
I think I lost some weight there
And I Im sure I need some rest
Sleepin dont come very easy
In a straight white vest
Sured like to see that little children
Shes only four years old old
Id give her back all of her playthings
Even even the ones I stole
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
When Ive gone insane
I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
I Ive gotta Ive gotta get out of here
I I gotta get out of here
I I gotta get out of here
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere
Ya gotta let me out of here
Let me outta here
Incoherent rambling shouts continue and fade as next verse starts 
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my lonely mind explode
Blown up in my face
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat
And I I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there
I guess he couldnt breathe
Said to myself this is very strange
Im glad it wasnt me
But now I hear those sirens callin
And so I am not free
I didnt want to be
I didnt want to be
I didnt want to be
See my lonely life unfold
I didnt want to be 
I see it every day
Leave me alone
I didnt want to be
Dont touch me 
See my lonely mind explode
When Ive gone Insane
