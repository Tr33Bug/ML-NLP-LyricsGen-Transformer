She struts into the room well I dont know her
But with a magnifying glance I just sorta look her over
We have a drink or two well maybe three
And then suddenly she starts telling me her life story
She says
Baby if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause its a long long way to paradise
And Im still on my own
I told her that I came from Detroit City
And I played guitar in a longhaired rock and roll band
She asked me why the singers name was Alice
I said Listen baby you really wouldnt understand
And I said
Baby if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause its a long long way to paradise
And Im still on my own
On my own
Oh baby if you want to be my lover
You better take me home
Cause its a long long way to paradise
And Im still on my own
Own
