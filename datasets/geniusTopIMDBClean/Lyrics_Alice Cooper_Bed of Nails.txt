I love the way you hurt me
My tears are your wine
Your thoughts would draw my plan for a cruise in vain
Like talons in the pale moon shining above us
The line between pleasure and pain has slowly vanished
As we sink deeper and deeper into a void of your venomous love
Yeah were gonna fight we do it every night
Baby when you scratch you know Im gonna bite
You can make me die I can make you cry
Opposites attract thats the reason why
No one else could make you feel like I do I do I do
No one ever gets that deep inside you as I do baby
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
Ill lay you down and when all else fails
Ill drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
First were gonna kiss then were gonna say
Dirty little words only lovers say
Rocking through the night rolling on the floor
When they hear us screaming theyll be breaking down the door
No one else could make you feel like I do I do I do
No one ever gets that deep inside you as I do baby
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
Ill lay you down and when all else fails
Ill drive you like hammer on the bed of nails


Bed of nails bed of nails
Ill drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Ow ow ow ow ow
Gonna drive you like hammer
Baby put me in your slammer
Oh yeah
No one else could make you feel like I do I do I do
No one ever gets that deep inside you as I do baby
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
Ill lay you down and when all else fails
Ill drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Our love is a bed of nails
Love hurts good on a bed of nails
Ill lay you down and when all else fails
Ill drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Bed of nails bed of nails
Ill drive you like hammer on the bed of nails
Ow ow ow ow ow
Gonna drive you like hammer
Baby put me in your slammer
Oh yeah
