Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley loves me like no other lover
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster baby I adore ya
Man or woman living
Couldnt love you like me baby
We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If Im too rough tell me
Im so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Aww
Yeah billion dollar baby
I got you in a dimestore
No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter
Any tighter than me maybe
Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog
Thats been infected by the rabies
We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If Im too rough tell me
Im so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Million dollar baby
Yeah billion dollar baby
Trillion dollar baby
Zillion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby baby
