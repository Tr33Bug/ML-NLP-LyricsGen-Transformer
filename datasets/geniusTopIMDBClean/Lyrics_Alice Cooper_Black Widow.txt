Leaving Lepidoptera  please dont touch the displays little boy so cute  moving to the next aisle we have arachnida the spiders our finest collection This friendly little devil is the Heptophilidae unfortunately harmless Next to him the nasty Lycosa Raptoria his tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of the skin And here my prize the Black Widow Isnt she lovely And so deadly Her kiss is fifteen times as poisonous as that of the Rattlesnake You see her venom is highly neurotoxic which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system  causing intense pain profuse sweating difficulty in breathing loss of consciousness violent convulsions and finally death You know I think what I love the most about her is her inborn need to dominate possess In fact immediately after the consummation of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the specie she kills and eats him Oh she is delicious and I hope he was Such power and dignity unhampered by sentiment If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy I feel that Man has ruled this world as stumbling demented childking long enough and as his empire crumbles my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor
These words he speaks are true were all humanary stew if
We dont pledge allegiance to The Black Widow
The horror that he brings the horror of his sting
The unholiest of kings the Black Widow
Our minds will be his toy
And every girl and boy will learn to be employed by the Black Widow
Love me yes we love me love him yes we love him
Love me yes we love me love him yes we love him
He sits upon his throne and picks at all the bones of his
Husbands and his wives hes devoured
He stares with a gleam with a laugh so obscene
At the virgins and the children hes deflowered
Love me yes we love me love him yes we love him
Love me yes we love me love him yes we love him
Our thoughts are hot and crazed our brains are webbed in haze
Of mindless senseless daze the Black Widow
These words he speaks are true were all humanary stew
If we dont pledge allegiance to the Black Widow
The Black Widow
