Were spinning round on this ball of hate
Theres no parole theres no great escape
Were sentenced here until the end of days
And then my brother theres a price to pay
Were only human we were born to die
Without the benefit of reason why
We live for pleasure  to be satisfied
And now its over theres no place to hide
Why dont you come down to
Its such a brutal planet
Its such an ugly world
Why wont you come down to
This world is such perfection  What a sight 
Its just like paradise  For my eyes 
A truly grand creation  What a sight 
From up here it looks so nice  For my eyes 
Its such a brutal planet
Its such a living hell
It was a holy garden
Thats right where Adam fell
Its where the bite was taken
Its where we chose to sin
Its where we first were naked
This is where our death begins
We took advice from that deceiving snake
He said dont worry its a piece of cake
And sent us swimming in a burning lake
Now were abandoned here for heavens sake
Why dont you come down to
Its such a brutal planet
Its such an ugly world
Why wont you come down to
This world is such perfection  What a sight 
Its just like paradise  For my eyes 
A truly grand creation  What a sight 
From up here it looks so nice  For my eyes 

Heres where we keep the armies
Heres where we write their names
Heres where the money god is
Heres our famous hall of shame
Heres where we starve the hungry
Heres where we cheat the poor
Heres where we beat the children
Here is where we pay the whore
Why dont you come down to
Its such a brutal planet
Its such an ugly world
Why wont you come down to
This world is such perfection  What a sight 
Its just like paradise  For my eyes 
A truly grand creation  What a sight 
From up here it looks so nice  For my eyes 
Right here we stoned the prophets
Built idols out of mud
Right here we fed the lions
Christian flesh and Christian blood
Down here is where we hung ya
Upon an ugly cross
Over there we filled the ovens
Right here the holocaust
