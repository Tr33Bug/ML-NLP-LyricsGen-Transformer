Clones  Were All  LyricsIm a clone
I know it and Im fine
Im one and more are on the way
Im two doctor
Threes on the line
Hell take incubation another day
Im all alone so are we all
Were all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are all
We destroyed the government
Were destroying time
No more problems on the way
Im through doctor
We dont need your kind
The other ones ugly ones
Stupid boys wrong ones
Im all alone so are we all
Were all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are all
Six is having problems adjusting to his clone status
Have to put him on a shelf
Please dont put me on a shelf
All day long we hear him crying so loud
I just wanna be myself
I just wanna be myself
I just wanna be myself be myself be myself
Im all alone so are we all
We destroyed the government
Were destroying time
No more problems on the way
Im through doctor
We dont need your kind
The other ones ugly ones
Stupid boys wrong ones
Im all alone so are we all
Were all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are all
Im all alone so are we all
Were all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are all
