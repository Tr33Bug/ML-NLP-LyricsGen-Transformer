Clones (Weâ€™re All) LyricsI'm a clone
I know it and I'm fine
I'm one and more are on the way
I'm two, doctor
Three's on the line
He'll take incubation another day

I'm all alone, so are we all
We're all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are all
We destroyed the government
We're destroying time
No more problems on the way
I'm through doctor
We don't need your kind
The other ones, ugly ones
Stupid boys, wrong ones

I'm all alone, so are we all
We're all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are all

Six is having problems adjusting to his clone status
Have to put him on a shelf
"Please don't put me on a shelf"
All day long we hear him crying so loud
I just wanna be myself
I just wanna be myself
I just wanna be myself, be myself, be myself

I'm all alone, so are we all

We destroyed the government
We're destroying time
No more problems on the way
I'm through doctor
We don't need your kind
The other ones, ugly ones
Stupid boys, wrong ones
You might also likeI'm all alone, so are we all
We're all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are all

I'm all alone, so are we all
We're all clones
All are one and one are all
All are one and one are allEmbed
