One thing I miss
Is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss
We met last night
Making love by the refrigerator light
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
One thing no lie
Ethyls frigid as an Eskimo Pie
Shes cool in bed
And she ought to be cause Ethyls dead
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
Come on Cold Ethyl
Freeze me babe
Its cool its nice
One thing its true
Cold Ethyl I am stuck on you
And everything is my way
Ethyl dont have much to say
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
Come here Cold Ethyl
What makes you so cold
Ooh so cold Ooh Ooh
Cold Ethyl Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl Cold Cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl Cold Cold Ethyl


If I live till ninetyseven
Youll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven
Cause youre cool youre ice
Cold Ethyl youre my paradise
