Little Betty ate a pound of aspirin
She got them from the shelf up on the wall
Bettys mommy wasnt there to save her
She didnt even hear her baby call
Dead babies cant take care of themselves
Dead babies cant take things off the shelf
Well we didnt want you anyway
Lalalala lalalala la la la
Daddy is an agrophile in Texas
Mommys on the bar most every night
Little Bettys sleeping in the graveyard
Living there in burgundy and white
Dead babies cant take care of themselves
Dead babies cant take things off the shelf
Well we didnt love you anyway
Lalalala lalalala la la la
Goodbye Little Betty
Goodbye Little Betty
So long Little Betty
So long Little Betty
Betty so long
Dead babies cant take care of themselves
Dead babies cant take things off the shelf
Well we didnt need you anyway
Lalalala lalalala la la la
Goodbye Little Betty
