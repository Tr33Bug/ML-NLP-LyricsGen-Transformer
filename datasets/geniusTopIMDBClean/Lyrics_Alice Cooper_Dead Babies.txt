Dead Babies Lyrics[Verse 1]
Little Betty ate a pound of aspirin
She got them from the shelf up on the wall
Betty's mommy wasn't there to save her
She didn't even hear her baby call

[Chorus]
Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well, we didn't want you anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la
[Verse 2]
Daddy is an agrophile in Texas
Mommy's on the bar most every night
Little Betty's sleeping in the graveyard
Living there in burgundy and white

[Chorus]
Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well, we didn't love you anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la

[Bridge]
Goodbye, Little Betty
Goodbye, Little Betty
So long, Little Betty
So long, Little Betty
Betty, so long

[Chorus]
Dead babies, can't take care of themselves
Dead babies, can't take things off the shelf
Well, we didn't need you anyway
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la

[Outro]
