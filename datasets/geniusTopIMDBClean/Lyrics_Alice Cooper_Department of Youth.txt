Were in trouble all the time
You read about us all in the papers
We walk around and bump into walls
A blind delegation
And we aint afraid of high power
Were bullet proof
And weve never heard of Eisenhower
Missile power justice or truth
Were the Department of Youth
Your new Department of Youth
Were the Department of Youth
Just me and youth
We talk about this whole stupid world
And still come out laughing ha
We never make any sense
But hell that never mattered
But well make it through our blackest hour
Were living proof
And weve never heard of Billy Sunday
Damon Runyon manners or couth
Were the Department of Youth
Your new Department of Youth
Were the Department of Youth
Just me and youth
Were the Department of Youth
The new Department of Youth
Were the Department of Youth
The new Department of Youth
Were the Department of Youth
Weve got the power
Were the Department of Youth
Weve got the power
Were the Department of Youth
Weve got the power
Whos got the power
We do
Were the Department of Youth
Weve got the power
We got the power
Yeah
Were the Department of Youth
Weve got the power
We got the power
Yeah
Were the Department of Youth
Weve got the power
And who gave it to you
