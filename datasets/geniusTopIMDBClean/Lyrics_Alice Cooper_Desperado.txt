Im a gambler and Im a runner
But you knew that when you lay down
Im a picture of ugly stories
Im a killer and Im a clown
Step into the street by sundown
Step into your last goodbye
Youre a target just by living
Twenty dollars will make you die
I wear lace and I wear black leather
My hands are lightning upon my gun
My shots are clean and my shots are final
My shots are deadly and when its done
Youre as stiff as my smoking barrel
Youre as dead as a desert night
Youre a notch and Im a legend
Youre at peace and I must hide
Tell me where the hell Im going
Let my bones fall in the dust
Cant you hear that ghost thats calling
As my Colt begins to rust in the dust
Im a killer Im a clown
Im a priest thats gone to town
