Get ready for the lady
Shes gonna be a treat
Simmer slightly til ready
Make her soft too
Make her sweet
I kiss the tears off from your chest
I felt the poison fright thats in your breath
I knew your precious life and I know your death
I squeeze the love out of your soul
All the perfect love thats in your soul
Youre just another spirit on parole
Devils food
You are  Devils food
You are  Devils food
Leaving Lepidoptera  please dont touch the displays little boy so cute  moving to the next aisle we have arachnida the spiders our finest collection This friendly little devil is the Heptophilidae unfortunately harmless Next to him the nasty Lycosa Raptoria his tiny fangs cause creeping ulcerations of the skin And here my prize the Black Widow Isnt she lovely And so deadly Her kiss is fifteen times as poisonous as that of the Rattlesnake You see her venom is highly neurotoxic which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system  causing intense pain profuse sweating difficulty in breathing loss of consciousness violent convulsions and finally death You know I think what I love the most about her is her inborn need to dominate possess In fact immediately after the consummation of her marriage to the smaller and weaker male of the specie she kills and eats him Oh she is delicious and I hope he was Such power and dignity unhampered by sentiment If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy I feel that Man has ruled this world as stumbling demented childking long enough and as his empire crumbles my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor
