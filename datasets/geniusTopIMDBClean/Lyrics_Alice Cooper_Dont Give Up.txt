Yeah I know youre struggling right now
We all are  in different ways
Its like a new world that we dont even know
Its hard to sleepeven harder to dream
But look youve got 7 billion brothers and sisters all in the same boat
So dont panic Life has a way of surviving and going on and on
Were not fragile  and we sure dont break easy
You know its so hard to cope
When youre just hoping theres hope
Were all hanging on by a thread
Were all staring at the razors edge
But were not going to step off the ledge
No
Our enemy is a cold indiscriminate monster
It doesnt care if youre old or newbornit exists to kill
You and I are nothing to it
It has no heart or soul or conscience
Do we fear it Yeah
Do we cower before it Hell no
Were the blood and guts human raceand we win
You know that its right
So we just gotta fight
Yeah were all hanging on by a thread
Were all staring at the razors edge
But were not going to step off the ledge
No
Were all hanging on by a thread
Were all staring at the razors edge
But were not going to step off the ledge
No
This is Alice Cooper in DetroitLets keep fightingDont give up
