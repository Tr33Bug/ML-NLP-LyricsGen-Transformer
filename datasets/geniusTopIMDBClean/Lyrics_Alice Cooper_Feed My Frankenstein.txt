Yes yes I know youre hungry
And here comes dinner
Feed my Frankenstein 
Well I aint evil
Im just good lookin
Start a little fire
Baby start cookin
Im a hungry man
But I dont want pizza
Ill blow down your house
And then Im gonna eat ya
Bring you to a simmer
Right on time
Run my greasy fingers
Up your greasy spine
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
Hes a psycho 
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And its feeding time
You dont want to talk
So baby shut up
And let me drink the wine
From your fur tea cup
Velcro candy sticky sweet
Make my tattoos
Melt in the heat
Well I aint no veggie
Like my flesh on the bone
Alive and lickin on your
Ice cream cone
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
Hes a psycho 
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And its feeding time
Baby whoa whoa oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstein
Whoa whoa baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstein
Hes a psycho
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
Hes a psycho 
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And its lunch time
