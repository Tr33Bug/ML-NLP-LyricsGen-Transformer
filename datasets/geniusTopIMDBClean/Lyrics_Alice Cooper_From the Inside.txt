I got lost on the road somewhere
Was it Texas or was it Canada
Drinking whiskey in the morning light
I work the stage all night long
At first we laughed about it
My longhaired drunken friends
Proposed a toast to Jimmys ghost
I never dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end
Im stuck here on the inside looking out
Im just another case
Wheres my makeup wheres my face on the inside
All got your kicks from what you saw up there
Eight bucks even buys a folding chair
I was downing seagrams on another flight
And I worked that stage all night long
You were screaming for the villain up there
And I was much obliged
The old road sure screwed me good this time
Its hard to see where the vicious circle ends
Im stuck here on the inside looking out
Thats no big disgrace
Wheres my makeup wheres my face on the inside
