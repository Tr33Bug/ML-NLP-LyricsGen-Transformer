Generation Landslide Lyrics[Intro]
La, da, da, da, da

[Verse 1]
Please clean your plate dear
The Lord above can see you
Don't you know people are starving in Korea?
Alcohol and razor blades, and poison and needles
Kindergarten people, they used 'em, they need 'em
The over indulgent machines were their children
There wasn't a way down on Earth here to cool 'em
'Cause they look just like humans, at Kresge's and Woolworth's
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Brats in battalions were ruling the streets
Sayin' generation landslide closed the gap between them
[Chorus]
And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
La, la, da, da, da

[Verse 2]
Militant mothers hiding in the basement
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles, heaved from pink high chairs
While Mothers' Lib burned birth certificate papers
And dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance
Sister's out till 5, doing bankers' son's hours
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father
Stop at full speed, at 100 miles per hour
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em

[Chorus]
But I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
La, la, da, da da, yeah-hoYou might also likeEmbed
