La da da da da
Please clean your plate dear
The Lord above can see you
Dont you know people are starving in Korea
Alcohol and razor blades and poison and needles
Kindergarten people they used em they need em
The over indulgent machines were their children
There wasnt a way down on Earth here to cool em
Cause they look just like humans at Kresges and Woolworths
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Brats in battalions were ruling the streets
Sayin generation landslide closed the gap between them
And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
La la da da da
Militant mothers hiding in the basement
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs
While Mothers Lib burned birth certificate papers
And dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer
Whos pubic to the world but involved in high finance
Sisters out till 5 doing bankers sons hours
But she owns a Maserati thats a gift from his father
Stop at full speed at 100 miles per hour
The Colgate invisible shield finally got em
But I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies
La la da da da yeahho
