I do my hair I paint my nails
It pours outside it never fails
So the makeup runs down my pretty face
Im a muddy mess a MAC disgrace
But when I leave this room tonight
Im gonna look and feel alright
Cause my mama says the worlds an oyster
And Im the pearl
Im a genuine American girl
A bonafide beauty in an ugly world
My vision of pure femininity
Yeah Im a genuine American girl
From my ruby red lips to my bleached blonde curls
Im everything I hoped to be
I look in the mirror and what do I see
That a modest little girl is looking back at me
The boys all whistle when I walk by
So I toss my hair and wink my eye
And when I hit the floor tonight
Im gonna look and feel alright
Cause my mama says the worlds an oyster
And Im the pearl
Im a genuine American girl
Im a rock and roll queen in a hiphop world
My vision of pure femininity
Yeah Im a genuine American girl
From my ruby red lips to my bleached blonde curls
Im everything I hoped to be
You think its vanity
Or some insanity
But this is nomans land
And I live here everyday
So come and dance with me
Come take a chance with me
Im only thirty out of fifty shades of grey
What do you say
Hey there big boy
Why dont you come up and see me tonight
And when we hit the floor tonight
Were gonna look and feel alright
Cause my mama says the worlds an oyster
And Im the pearl
Im a genuine American girl
A bonafide beauty in an ugly world
My vision of pure femininity
Yeah Im a genuine American girl
From my ruby red lips to my bleached blonde curls
Im every HeMans fantasy
A feminine fatality
You gotta know that I am
Everything I want to be oh yeah
Im everything I wanna be
Uhhuh oh yeah
