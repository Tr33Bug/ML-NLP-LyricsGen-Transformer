For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens youve enraged
You can go to Hell
For gambling and drinking alcohol constantly
For making us doubt our parents authority
For choosing to be a living obscenity
You can go to Hell
Youre something that never should have happened
Youd even make your Grandma sick
Youd poison a blind mans dog and steal his cane
Youd gift wrap a leper and mail him to your Aunt Jane
Youd even forcefeed a diabetic a candy cane
You can go to Hell
Youre something that never should have happened
Youd even make your Grandma sick
For criminal acts and violence on the stage
For being a brat refusing to act your age
For all of the decent citizens youve enraged
You can go to Hell
