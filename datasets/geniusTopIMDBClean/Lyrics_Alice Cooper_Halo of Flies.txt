Ive got the answers to all of your questions
If youve got the money to pay me in gold
I will be living in old Monte Carlo
And you will be reading the secrets I sold
Daggers and contacts and bright shiny limos
Ive got a watch that turns into a lifeboat
Glimmering nightgowns poisonous as cobras
Silencer under the heel of my shoe
The elegance of China
They sent her to lie here on her back
But as she deeply moves me
Shed rather shoot me in my tracks
And while a Middle Asian lady
She really came as no surprise
But I still did destroy her
And I will smash halo of flies
I crossed the ocean where no one would see
And I put a timebomb in your submarine
Goodbye to old friends the secrets in hand
With phonied up papers and counterfeit plans
You never will understand
