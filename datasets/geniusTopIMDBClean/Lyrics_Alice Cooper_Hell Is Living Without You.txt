I cant find your face
In a thousand masqueraders
Youre hidden in the colors
Of a million other lost charaders
In lifes big parade
Im the loneliest spectator
Cause youre gone without a trace
In a sea of faceless imitators
I cant take another night
Burning inside this
Hell is living without your
Love aint nothing without your
Touch me heaven would be like
Hell is living without you
Try to walk away
When I see the time Ive wasted
Starving at a feast
And all this wine Ive never tasted
On my lips your memory
Has been stained
Is it all in vain
Tell me whos to blame
I cant take another night
Burning inside this
Hell is living without your
Love aint nothing without your
Touch me heaven would be like
Hell is living without you

Nights get longer and colder
Im down begging to hold ya
On my own and I feel like
Hell is living without you
Living without you
Hell is living without your
Love aint nothing without your
Touch me heaven would be like
Hell is living without you
Nights get longer and colder
Im down begging to hold ya
On my own and I feel like
Hell is living without you
