Hello Hooray Let the show begin
Ive been ready
Hello Hooray Let the lights grow dim
Ive been ready
Ready as this audience
Thats coming here to dream
Loving every second
Every moment every scream
Ive been waiting so long
To sing my song
And Ive been waiting so long
For this thing to come
Yeah Ive been thinking so long
I was the only one
Roll out Roll out
With your American dream and its recruits
Ive been ready
Roll out Roll out
With your circus freaks and hula hoops
Ive been ready
Ready as this audience
Thats coming here to dream
Loving every second
Every moment every scream
Ive been waiting so long
To sing my song
And Ive been waiting so long
For this thing to come
Oh Ive been thinking so long
I was the only one
I can stand here strong and thin
And I can laugh when this thing begins
God I feel so strong
I feel so strong
Im so strong
I feel so strong I feel so strong
So strong
God I feel so strong
I am so strong
So strong
I feel so strong I feel so strong
I feel so strong I feel so strong
I feel so strong feel so strong
I feel so strong I feel so strong
So strong
