Hes Back  The Man Behind the Mask  Lyrics
Kikiki mamama
Youre with your baby
And youre parked alone
On a summer night
Youre deep in love
But youre deeper in the woods
You think youre doin alright
Did you hear that voice
Did you see that face
Or was it just a dream
This cant be real
That only happens babe
On the movie screen
Oh but hes back
Hes the man behind the mask
And hes out of control
Hes back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole
Youre swimmin with your girl
Out on lovers lake
And the wind blows cold
It chills your bones
But youre still on the make
Thats a bad mistake
Ahh but the moon was full
And you had a chance
To be all alone
But youre not alone
This is your last dance
And your last romance
Yeah cause hes back
Hes the man behind the mask
And hes out of control
Hes back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole
Kikiki mamama
Kikiki mamama
Oh if you see him comin
Get away if you can
Just keep on runnin
Run as fast as you can
Hes a dangerous dangerous man
And hes out tonight
And hes watchin you
And he knows your house
Kikiki mamama 
No dont turn out the lights
Yeah cause hes back
Hes the man behind the mask
And hes out of control
Hes back
The man behind the mask
And hes after your soul
Hes back
Hes the man behind the mask
And hes out of control
Hes back
The man behind the mask
And hes after your soul
Hes back  Kikiki mamama 
Hes the man behind the mask  Kikiki mamama 
And hes out of control
Hes back  Kikiki mamama 
The man behind the mask  Kikiki mamama 
And hes after your soul
Hes back  Kikiki mamama 
Hes the man behind the mask
