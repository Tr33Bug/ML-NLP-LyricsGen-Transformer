Heâ€™s Back (The Man Behind the Mask) Lyrics[Intro]
Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma

[Verse 1]
You're with your baby
And you're parked alone
On a summer night
You're deep in love
But you're deeper in the woods
You think you're doin' alright
[Verse 2]
Did you hear that voice?
Did you see that face?
Or was it just a dream?
This can't be real
That only happens, babe
On the movie screen

[Chorus]
Oh, but he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole

[Verse 3]
You're swimmin' with your girl
Out on lovers' lake
And the wind blows cold
It chills your bones
But you're still on the make
That's a bad mistake

[Verse 4]
Ahh, but the moon was full
And you had a chance
To be all alone
But you're not alone
This is your last dance
And your last romance
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, 'cause he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he crawled out of his hole

[Post-Chorus]
Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma
Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oh, if you see him comin'
Get away if you can
Just keep on runnin'
Run as fast as you can
He's a dangerous, dangerous man

And he's out tonight
And he's watchin' you
And he knows your house
(Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma)
No, don't turn out the lights
[Chorus]
Yeah, 'cause he's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul
He's back
He's the man behind the mask
And he's out of control
He's back
The man behind the mask
And he's after your soul

[Outro]
He's back (Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma)
He's the man behind the mask (Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma)
And he's out of control
He's back (Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma)
The man behind the mask (Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma)
And he's after your soul
He's back (Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma)
He's the man behind the mask4Embed
