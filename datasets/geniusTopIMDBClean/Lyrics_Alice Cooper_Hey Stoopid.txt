Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
Hey bro take it slow
You aint livin in a video
Youre flying low with a high velocity
No doubt youre stressin out
That aint what rock n rolls about
Get off that one way trip down lonely street
Now I know youve been kicked around
You aint alone in this ugly town
You stick a needle in your arm
You bite the dust you buy the farm
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
What ya tryin to do
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
Cmon girl its a better day
Get your foot out of that grave
Dont let that one love tear your world apart
Cmon babe kick that stuff
Show the street it aint so tough
Quit lyin around with a crippled broken heart
Now I know youve been seeing red
Dont put a pistol to your head
Sometimes your answers heaven sent
Your way is so damn permanent
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
What ya tryin to do
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
This aint your daddy talkin
You know I know
Your story aint so shocking
You know I know
Blow some steam
Cmon and scream
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
What ya tryin to do
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey  hey  hey stoopid
What ya tryin to do
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
They win you lose
Hey hey hey hey
Oh 
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
What ya tryin to do
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
Yeah If you do that they win you lose
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid
