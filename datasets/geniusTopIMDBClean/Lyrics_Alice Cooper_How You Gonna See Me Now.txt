Dear darlin surprised to hear from me
Bet youre sittin drinkin coffee yawnin sleepily
Just to let you know
Im gonna be home soon
Im kinda awkward and afraid
Time has changed your point of view
How you gonna see me now
Please dont see me ugly babe
Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now
Since weve been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
Listen darlin now Im heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess
Yes Im worried honey
Guess thats natural though
Its like Im waiting for a welcome sign
Like a hobo in the snow
How you gonna see me now
Please dont see me ugly babe
Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now
Since weve been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
And just like the first time
Were just strangers again
I might have grown out of style
In the place Ive been
And just like the first time
Ill be shakin inside
When I walk in the door
Therell be no place to hide
How you gonna see me now
Please dont see me ugly babe
Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways
How you gonna see me now
Since weve been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home
