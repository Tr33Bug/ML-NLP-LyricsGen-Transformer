If there is a tear on my face
It makes me shiver to the bone
It shakes me Babe
Its just a heartache that got caught in my eye
And you know I never cry I never cry
Sometimes I drink more than I need
Until the TVs dead and gone
I may be lonely
But Im never alone
And the night may pass me by
But Ill never cry
Take away take away my eyes
Sometimes Id rather be blind
Break a heart break a heart of stone
Open it up but dont you leave it alone
Cuz thats all I got to give you
Believe me Babe it aint been used
My hearts a virgin it aint ever  been tried
And you know Ill never cry
And you know Ill never cry
And you know Ill never cry
Never cry Ill never cry
Break a heart break a heart of stone
Open it up but dont leave dont you leave me alone
Cuz thats all I got to give you
Believe me Babe it aint been used
My hearts a virgin it aint never been tried
And you know Ill never cry
Never cry
Ill never cry
