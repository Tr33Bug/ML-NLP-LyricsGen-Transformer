At the end of the rainbow theres happiness
And to find it how often Ive tried
But my life is a race
Just a wild goose chase
And all my dreams have been denied
Why have I always been a failure
What can the reason be
I wonder if the worlds to blame
I wonder if it could be me
Im always chasing rainbows watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
And some fellows make a winning sometime
And I never even make a gain
Im always chasing rainbows waiting to find the little bluebird in vain
