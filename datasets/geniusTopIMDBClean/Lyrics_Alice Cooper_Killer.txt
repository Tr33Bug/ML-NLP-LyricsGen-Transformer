What did I do to deserve such a fate
I didnt really want to get involved in this thing
Someone handed me this gun and I
I gave it everything
Yeah I gave it everything
I came into this life looked all around
I saw just what I liked and took what I found
Nothing came easy nothing came free
And nothing came at all until they came after me
Yeah yeah
What did I do to deserve such a fate
I didnt really want to get involved in this thing
Someone handed me a gun and I
I gave it everything
I gave it everything
Sigh
