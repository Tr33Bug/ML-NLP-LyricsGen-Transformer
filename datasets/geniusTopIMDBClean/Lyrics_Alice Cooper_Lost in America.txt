Lost in America LyricsI can't get a girl cuz I ain't got a car
I can't get a car cuz I ain't got a job
I can't get a job cuz I ain't got a car
So I'm looking for a girl with a job and a car
Don't you know where you are

Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost in America, lost

I got a mom but I ain't got a dad
My dad's got a wife but she ain't my mom
Mom's looking for a man to be my dad
But I want my mom and dad to be my real mom and dad
Is that so bad?
Oh, I think I've been had
Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost in America, lost
Lost in America
Lost in America
Lost in America, lost

Well, I live at the Se7en Eleven
Well, I'm tryin' to play this guitar
Well, I'm learning "Stairway to Heaven"
Cuz Heaven's where you are

I can't go to school cuz I ain't got a gun
I ain't got a gun cuz I ain't got a job
I ain't got a job cuz I can't go to school
So I'm looking for a girl with a gun and a job
And a house with cable!
Don't you know where you are

Hey man, you're
