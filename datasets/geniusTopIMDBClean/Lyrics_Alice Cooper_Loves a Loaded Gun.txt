Somebody saw you at the station
You had your suitcase in your hand
You didnt give no information
You walked off with another man
Im always standing in the shadows baby
I watched you give yourself away
You take em home into your bedroom
You had another busy day
I tried to look the other way and fake it
You push me to the limits
I cant take it
One down one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
Red lights stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill
Someday theyll put me in a squad car
Someday theyll throw away the key
But til that day Ill be a mad dog
Cause thats what you taught me to be
You looked into the eyes of men above you
I was the one who really tried to love you
One down one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
Red lights stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
And it shoots to kill
Pull the trigger
I tried to look the other way and fake it
You know you push me right to the limit
I cant take it
One down one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
Red lights stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
One down one to go
Just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
Red lights stop and go
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger
Sometimes loves a loaded gun
Somebody saw you at the station
