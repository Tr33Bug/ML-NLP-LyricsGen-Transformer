No More Mr. Nice Guy Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

[Pre-Chorus]
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean
[Chorus]
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

[Pre-Chorus]
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm feelin' real shot down
And I'm, I'm gettin' mean

[Chorus]
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

[Verse 2]
My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eyes (Nice guy)
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle
And dad has to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith
He, he recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said
You might also like[Chorus]
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean<
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene

[Outro]
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said you're sick, you're obscene4Embed
