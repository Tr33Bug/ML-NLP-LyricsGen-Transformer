No More Mr Nice Guy Lyrics
I used to be such a sweet sweet thing
Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They cant be seen with me
And Im gettin real shot down
And Im feeling mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say hes sick hes obscene
I got no friends cause they read the papers
They cant be seen with me
And Im feelin real shot down
And Im Im gettin mean
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say hes sick hes obscene
My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eyes  Nice guy 
Mas been thrown out of the social circle
And dad has to hide
I went to church incognito
When everybody rose the Reverend Smith
He he recognized me
And punched me in the nose he said
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said youre sick youre obscene
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
He said youre sick youre obscene
