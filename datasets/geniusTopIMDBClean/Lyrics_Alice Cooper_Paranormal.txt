Im condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of light
And my shadow has life of its own
Watching you while you sleep all alone
When the night is all cool skin and bones
And you lie wrapped in sheets on your own
Theres a ring on your dead telephone
Dont be scared when theres nobody home
Like a spider web kiss on your face
That familiar smell just a trace
Thats my scent that I left on your lace
So youre never alone
No youre never alone
Im condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of light
