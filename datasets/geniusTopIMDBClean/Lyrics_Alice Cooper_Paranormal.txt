Paranormal Lyrics[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of light
And my shadow has life of its own
Watching you while you sleep all alone

[Verse 2]
When the night is all cool skin and bones
And you lie wrapped in sheets on your own
There's a ring on your dead telephone
Don't be scared when there's nobody home
[Verse 3]
Like a spider web kiss on your face
That familiar smell, just a trace
That's my scent that I left on your lace
So you're never alone
No you're never alone

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I'm condemned to the long endless night
And I live in the absense of lightYou might also likeEmbed
