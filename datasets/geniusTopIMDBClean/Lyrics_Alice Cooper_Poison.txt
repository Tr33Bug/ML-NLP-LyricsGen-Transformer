Your cruel device
Your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain your thrill
I wanna love you but I better not touch  dont touch 
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much  too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Youre poison running through my veins
Youre poison
I dont wanna break these chains
Your mouth so hot
Your web Im caught
Your skin so wet
Black lace on sweat
I hear you calling and its needles and pins  and pins 
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Dont wanna touch you but youre under my skin  deep in 
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
Youre poison running through my veins
Youre poison
I dont wanna break these chains
Poison
One look  one look  could kill  could kill 
My pain your thrill
I want to love you but I better not touch  dont touch 
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much  too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Youre poison running through my veins
Youre poison
I dont wanna break these chains
Poison  poison 
I want to love you but I better not touch  dont touch 
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much  too much 
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
Yeah
Well I dont want to break these chains
Poison  poison  no
Running deep inside my veins
Burning deep  poison  inside my brain
Poison  poison 
I dont want  poison  to break these chains
Poison  poison
