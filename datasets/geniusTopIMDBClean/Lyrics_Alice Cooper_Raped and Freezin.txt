Raped and Freezin’ Lyrics[Verse 1]
Finally got a ride from some broad
Down from Santa Fe
She was a real go-getter
She drawled so sweetly
"I think, child, that things’ll get better"
We pulled off the highway
Night black as a widow
"Yeah, I read the Bible," she said
"I want to know of you"
[Chorus]
Hey, I think I've got a live one
Hey, I think I’ve found a live one
Hey, I think I've got a live one, yeah, yeah
Think I've got a live one
Oh, ok boys

[Verse 2]
Felt like I was hit by a diesel
Or a greyhound bus
She was no baby-sitter
"Get now sugar, never have thought
You’d be a quitter"
I opened the back door, she was greedy
I ran through the desert she was chasin'
No time to get dressed, so I was naked
Stranded in Chihuahua

[Chorus]
Hey, I think I've got a live one
Hey, yeah I got a live one
Hey-hey-hey, I think I've got a live one
Hey, oh got a live one

[Chorus]
Hey, I think I've got a live one
Hey, yeah I got a live one
Hey-hey-hey, I think I've got a live one
Hey, oh got a live one

Alone, raped and freezin'
Alone, cold and sneezin'
Alone down in Mexico
