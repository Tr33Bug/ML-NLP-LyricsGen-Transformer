Finally got a ride from some broad
Down from Santa Fe
She was a real gogetter
She drawled so sweetly
I think child that thingsll get better
We pulled off the highway
Night black as a widow
Yeah I read the Bible she said
I want to know of you
Hey I think Ive got a live one
Hey I think Ive found a live one
Hey I think Ive got a live one yeah yeah
Think Ive got a live one
Oh ok boys
Felt like I was hit by a diesel
Or a greyhound bus
She was no babysitter
Get now sugar never have thought
Youd be a quitter
I opened the back door she was greedy
I ran through the desert she was chasin
No time to get dressed so I was naked
Stranded in Chihuahua
Hey I think Ive got a live one
Hey yeah I got a live one
Heyheyhey I think Ive got a live one
Hey oh got a live one
Hey I think Ive got a live one
Hey yeah I got a live one
Heyheyhey I think Ive got a live one
Hey oh got a live one
Alone raped and freezin
Alone cold and sneezin
Alone down in Mexico
Alone
