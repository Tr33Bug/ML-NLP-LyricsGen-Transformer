Well we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin all that noise
Cause they found new toys
Well we cant salute ya
Cant find a flag
If that dont suit ya
Thats a drag
Schools out for summer
Schools out forever
Schools been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teachers dirty looks yeah
Well we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We cant even think of a word that rhymes
Schools out for summer
Schools out forever
My schools been blown to pieces
No more pencils
No more books
No more teachers dirty looks
Out for summer
Out til fall
We might not come back at all
Schools out forever
Schools out for summer
Schools out with fever
Schools out completely
