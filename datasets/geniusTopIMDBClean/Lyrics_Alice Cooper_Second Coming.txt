I couldnt tell
If the bells were getting louder
The songs they ring I finally recognize
I only know
Hell is getting hotter
Devils getting smarter all the time
And it would be nice
To walk upon the water
To talk again to angels
On my side
Time is getting closer
I read it on a poster
Fanatical exposers
On corners prophesised
It would be nice
To walk upon the water
To talk again to angels
At my side
I just come back to show you
All my words are golden
So have no gods before me
Im the light
