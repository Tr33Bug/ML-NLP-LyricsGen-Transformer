Some folks love to see red
Some folks never talk about it
Some folks crave a blue lady
Some folks know and still they doubt it
Im just no good without it
Im not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl
Baby baby
Come on and save me save me
My my baby baby
Come on and save me now
Some folks love to feel pain
Some folks wake up every mornin
Some folks live for no reason
Some folks die without a warning
Im just no good without it
Im not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl
Baby baby
Come on and save me save me
My my baby baby
Come on and save me save me
My my baby baby
Come on and save me now
I cant live without it
I just cant live without it
I dont wanna think about it
Dont wanna think about it
I just cant live without it
I cant live
Im just no good without it
Im not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl

Baby baby
Come on and save me save me
My my baby baby
Come on and save me save me
My my baby baby
Come on and save me save me
My my baby baby
Come on and save me now
Cause I I cant live without it
I just cant live without it
I dont wanna think about it
