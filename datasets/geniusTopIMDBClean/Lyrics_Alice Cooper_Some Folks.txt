Some Folks LyricsSome folks love to see red
Some folks never talk about it
Some folks crave a blue lady
Some folks know and still they doubt it

I'm just no good without it
I'm not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl

Baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me
My, my baby, baby
Come on and save me now
Some folks love to feel pain
Some folks wake up every mornin'
Some folks live for no reason
Some folks die without a warning

I'm just no good without it
I'm not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl

Baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me
My, my baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me
My, my baby, baby
Come on and save me now

I can't live without it
I just can't live without it
I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think about it
I just can't live without it
I can’t live

[Guitar Solo]

I'm just no good without it
I'm not a man at all
It makes my skin crawl

Come on and save me, save me
My, my baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me
My, my baby, baby
Come on and save me, save me
My, my baby, baby
Come on and save me now

‘Cause I, I can't live without it
I just can't live without it
I don't wanna think about itEmbed
