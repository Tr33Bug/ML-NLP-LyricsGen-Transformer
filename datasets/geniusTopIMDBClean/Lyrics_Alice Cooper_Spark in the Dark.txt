Welcome to the party
Its only me and you
Tell the world to go away babe
And Ill tell you what to do
Come over here and kiss me
I want to pull your hair
Turn out the lights and hold me
I want to touch you everywhere
We dont need nobody baby
We dont need champagne
Ill take you to the deepest darkest hottest lovers lane
For a little spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Dont matter where we sleep
Dont matter where we park
All we need is a spark spark spark in the dark
Spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Ill come around midnight
Well be crawlin on the floor
Burnin with the fever
And yellin out for more
But dont you write it in your diary baby
Dont blab it on the phone
Cause if your mom and dad find out
Theyll skin me to the bone
Now we dont need instructions baby
Dont you be afraid
It takes a little friction haha
Thats how our love is made
From a little spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Dont matter what you say
No matter what you do
As long as it is me and you
We got a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark yeah
We dont need nobody baby
We dont need cocaine
Ill take you to the deepest darkest hottest lovers lane
Spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Dont matter where we sleep
Dont matter where we park
All we need is a spark spark spark in the dark
Spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
Dont matter what you say
No matter what you do
As long as it is me and you
We got a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark yeah
Just a little spark in the dark
I need a spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
A little tiny spark in the dark
Just a little spark in the dark
