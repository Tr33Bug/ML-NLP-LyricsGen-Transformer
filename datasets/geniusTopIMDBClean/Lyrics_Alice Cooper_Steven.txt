I dont want to see you go
I dont even want to be there
I will cover up my eyes
And pray it goes away
Youve only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming please stop screaming
I dont like to hear you cry
You just dont know how deep that cuts me
So I will cover up my eyes
And it will go away
Youve only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming please stop screaming
STEVEN
STEVEN
I hear my name
STEVEN
Is someone calling me I hear my name
STEVEN
That icy breath that whispers screams of pain
I dont want to feel you die
But if thats the way that God has planned you
Ill put pennies on your eyes
And it will go away
See
Youve only lived a minute of your life
I must be dreaming please stop screaming
Steven Is someone calling me No
Steven
I think I hear a voice its outside the door
STEVEN
I hear my name
STEVEN
Is someone calling me I hear my name
STEVEN
WHAT DO YOU WANT
STEVEN
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WHAT DO YOU WANT
STEVEN
STEVEN
STEVEN
I hear my name
