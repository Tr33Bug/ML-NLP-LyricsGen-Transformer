What a drag it is
In these gold lame jeans
Is this the coolest way
To get though your teens
Well I cut my hair weird
I read that it was in
I look like a rooster
That was drowned and raised again
What are you going to do
Ill tell you what Im going to do
Why dont you get away
Im going to leave today
I ran into my room
And I fell down on my knees
Well I thought that fifteen
Was going to be a breeze
I picked up my guitar
To blast away the clouds
Somebody in the next room yelled
You got to turn that damn thing down
What are you going to do
Ill tell you what Im going to do
Why dont you get away
Well Im going to cry all day
And I know trouble is brewing out there
But I can hardly care
They fight all night about his private secretary
Lipstick stain blonde hair
What are you going to do
Ill tell you what Im going to do
Why dont you run away
Im going to leave today
But even I dont know what Im going to do
Dont know what Im going to do
No

What are you going to do
Ill tell you what Im going to do
Why dont you run away
Im going to leave today
What are you going to do
Ill tell you what Im going to do
Why dont you get away
Id rather to cry all day
