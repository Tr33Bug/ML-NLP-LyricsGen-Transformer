I wake up in the basement
Im so hungry
Im dry
I must be here sleepwalking
Mustnt I
Getting up from my easy chair looking for my wife
Following a trail of crimson
Spots that lead into the night
Suddenly I realize
I see it all through real eyes
These crimson spots are dripping from my hand
And ooh it makes me feel like a man
