Welcome to my nightmare
I think youre gonna like it
I think youre gonna feel you belong
A nocturnal vacation
Unnecessary sedation
You want to feel at home cause you belong
Welcome to my nightmare whoawhoaoh
Welcome to my breakdown
I hope I didnt scare you
Thats just the way we are when we come down
We sweat and laugh and scream here
Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel right at home here
Welcome to my breakdown whoawhoaoh
Youre welcome to my nightmare yeahyeahah
Welcome to my nightmare
I think youre gonna like it
I think youre gonna feel you belong
We sweat and laugh and scream here
Cause life is just a dream here
You know inside you feel right at home here
Welcome to my nightmare oohoohooh
Welcome to my breakdown
Yeah
