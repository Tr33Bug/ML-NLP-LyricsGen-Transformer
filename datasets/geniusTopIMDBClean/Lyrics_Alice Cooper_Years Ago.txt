Here I go again
Up and down alone
All my friends went home
Years ago
All my toys are broken and
So am I inside mom
The carnival has closed
Years ago
Im a little boy
No Im a great big man
No lets be a little boy
For a little while longer
Maybe an hour
No Steven
We have to go back now
Isnt that our mom calling
Steven come home
