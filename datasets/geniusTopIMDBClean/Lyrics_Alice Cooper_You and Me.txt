When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I wanna take you and squeeze you
Til the passion starts to rise
I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
But you and me aint no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Some lovin
And TV yeah
And thats enough for a workin man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you babe
Well thats enough for me
Sometimes when youre asleep
And Im just starin at the ceiling
I wanna reach out and touch you
But you just go on dreamin
If I could take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
But you and me aint no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Some lovin
And TV yeah
Thats enough for a workin man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you sweetheart
Thats just enough for me
You and me aint no super stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Some popcorn
And TV yeah
And thats enough for a workin man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you babe
Youre just enough for me

When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I like to hold you squeeze you
Til the passion starts to rise
I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
You and me aint no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed
Of lovin
And TV yeah
And thats enough for a workin man
What I am well thats what I am
I tell you baby
Thats just enough for me
