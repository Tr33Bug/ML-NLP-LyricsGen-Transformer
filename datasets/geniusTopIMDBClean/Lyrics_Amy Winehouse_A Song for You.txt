Ive been so many places in my life and time
Ive sung a lot of songs Ive made some bad rhyme
Ive acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But were alone now and Im singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
Ive treated you unkindly cant you see
Ooh heres no one more important to me
So darling wont you please see through me
Because were alone now and Im singing this song for you yeah yeah
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front well baby I was hiding
But now Im so much better with my words coming together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where theres no space or time
I love you for my life
Because you the boy next door and a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember remember remember remember remember
Being together and I was singing this song for you yeah
We were alone and I was singing this song
Singing this song yeah yeah yeah
We were all alone
And I was singing my song for you you you
We were alone and I was singing our song for you
You know what Donny Hathaway you know what
I see Donny Hathaway is like um my Carleen Anderson
Like on Marvin Gaye like great but
Donny Hathaway likehe couldnt contain himself
He had something in him you know
