TranslationsFran√ßaisAddicted Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell your boyfriend, next time he around
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if brave would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you then leave him my dro

[Chorus]
When you smoke all my weed, man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours
[Verse 2]
Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door, make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams

[Chorus]
When you smoke all my weed, man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours

[Verse 3]
I'm my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man but I gots to burn?
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself and smoke my home grown
Oh, it's got me addicted
Does more than any dick did

[Outro]
Yeah, I can get mine
And you get yours
Hey, I can get mine
And you get yoursYou might also like14Embed
