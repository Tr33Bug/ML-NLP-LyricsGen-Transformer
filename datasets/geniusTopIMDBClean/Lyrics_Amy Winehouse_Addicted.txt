TranslationsFranais
Tell your boyfriend next time he around
To buy his own weed and dont wear my shit down
I wouldnt care if brave would give me some more
Id rather him leave you then leave him my dro
When you smoke all my weed man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours
Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
Ill check him at the door make sure he got green
Im tighter than airport security teams
When you smoke all my weed man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours
Im my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man but I gots to burn
Dont make no difference if I end up alone
Id rather have myself and smoke my home grown
Oh its got me addicted
Does more than any dick did
Yeah I can get mine
And you get yours
Hey I can get mine
And you get yours
