Attract me until it hurts to concentrate
Distract me stops me doin work I hate
And just to show him how it feels
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair
Amy Amy Amy 
Although Ive been here before
Amy Amy Amy 
Hes just too hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think youd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy 
Wheres my moral parallel
It takes me half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness for the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track
Amy Amy Amy 
Although Ive been here before
Amy Amy Amy 
Hes just too hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell yeah
I think hed wear me well
Amy Amy Amy 
So wheres my moral parallel
His own style right down to his Diesel jeans
Immobile I cant think by any means
Underwear peeks out the top
Ill let you know when you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know Id look good on you


Amy Amy Amy 
Although Ive been here before
Amy Amy Amy 
Youre too hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think youd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy 
So wheres my moral parallel
Creative energy abused
And all my lyrics go unused
And when I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasise yeah
Amy Amy Amy 
Although Ive been here before
Amy Amy Amy 
Hes just too hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think hed wear me well
Amy Amy Amy 
So wheres my moral parallel
Amy Amy Amy 
Although Ive been here before yeah
Amy Amy Amy 
Hes just too hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think hed wear me well yeah
Amy Amy Amy 
Oh yeah wheres my moral parallel
