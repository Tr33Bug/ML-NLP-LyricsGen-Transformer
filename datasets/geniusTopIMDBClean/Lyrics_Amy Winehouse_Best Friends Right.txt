I cant wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But were best friends right
Youre too good at pretending you dont care
Theres enough resentment in the air
You dont want me in the flat when youre home at night
But we are best friends right
Youre Stephanie and Im Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up forget
Everything that happened in between
Nickys right when he says I cant win
So I dont wanna tell you anythin
I cant even think about how you feel inside
But we are best friends right
I dont like the way you say my name
Youre always looking for someone to blame blame
You want me to suffer just cause you was born wide
But we are best friends right
Youre Stephanie and Im Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up forget
Everything that happened in between
I had love for you when I was four
And theres no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday Ill buy the Rizla and you get the dro
Cause we are best friends right right right
Cause we are best friends right
Because we are best friends right
