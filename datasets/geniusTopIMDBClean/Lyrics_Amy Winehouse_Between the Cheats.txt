I would die before I divorce ya
Id take a thousand thumps for my love
Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
Cause anyone whos seen us
Through our victories and dumb defeats
Knows that Ill take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats
Between the cheats the ah  Between the cheats 
Between the cheats the ah  Between the cheats 
My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still makes this housewife blush
So Im holding my hand in his
Im sittin on the royal flush
Women drink him in swim in him with green eyes
Then go home and cash the chips youve got
And here maybe two oh two bottles
The jack of hearts is my jackpot
Between the cheats the ah  Between the cheats 
Between the cheats the ah  Between 
Cause we all have to lock eyes
And I know is my heart beat
Theres a winning secret to both
And its sworn between the cheats
Between the cheats the ah  Between the cheats 
Between the cheats the ah  Between 
Between the cheats the ah  Between the cheats 
Between the cheats the ah  Between the cheats
