Her name is Cherry weve just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still dont see me like you ought to do
Maybe we could talk bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dont know how to tune you down
Youre so thick and my patiences thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name
And when Im lonely Cherrys there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you dont care
You wont call me back youre stubborn as a mule
Maybe we could talk bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think Ive gone too far
Im talking bout my new guitar
