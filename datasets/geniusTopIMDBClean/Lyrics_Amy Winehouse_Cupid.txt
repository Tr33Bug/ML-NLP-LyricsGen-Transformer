Cupid Lyrics[Chorus]
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Verse 1]
I don't want to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losin' all my happiness
For I love a man who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so
[Chorus]
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Verse 2]
Now if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear I'm going to love him 'til eternity
I know that, 'tween the both of us, his heart we can steal
Cupid, help me if you will, so

[Chorus]
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Outro]
Yeah, Cupid
Oh, oh, Cupid, yeah
Oh, CupidYou might also like3Embed
