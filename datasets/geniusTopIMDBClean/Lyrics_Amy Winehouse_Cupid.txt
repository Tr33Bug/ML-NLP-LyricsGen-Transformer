Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lovers heart for me
I dont want to bother you
But Im in distress
Theres danger of me losin all my happiness
For I love a man who doesnt know I exist
And this you can fix so
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Now if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear Im going to love him til eternity
I know that tween the both of us his heart we can steal
Cupid help me if you will so
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Yeah Cupid
Oh oh Cupid yeah
