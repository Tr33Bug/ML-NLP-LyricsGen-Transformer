Detachment Lyrics[Refrain]
I pulled through, it's finished, it's over and done
Now I'm gon' sit back, gon' wait for the fun
Like a finger to the strings
You'd wail if I said these things

[Verse]
Have to lay awake guilty and watch you sleep
Or would you take me in your arms and weep?
I'm culpable for your scornful ways
And I can still taste better days
Now maybe it is for the best
But I've lost interest
[Refrain]
I did it, it's finished, it's over and done
Now I'm gon' sit back, gon' wait for the fun
Like a finger to the strings
You'd wail if I said these things

[Outro]
I did it, it's finished, it's over and doneYou might also like1Embed
