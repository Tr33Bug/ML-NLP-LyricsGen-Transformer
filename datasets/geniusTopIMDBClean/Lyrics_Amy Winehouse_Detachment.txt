I pulled through its finished its over and done
Now Im gon sit back gon wait for the fun
Like a finger to the strings
Youd wail if I said these things
Have to lay awake guilty and watch you sleep
Or would you take me in your arms and weep
Im culpable for your scornful ways
And I can still taste better days
Now maybe it is for the best
But Ive lost interest
I did it its finished its over and done
Now Im gon sit back gon wait for the fun
Like a finger to the strings
Youd wail if I said these things
I did it its finished its over and done
