Woo
When you walk in the bar
And youre dressed like a star
Rockin your eff me pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Cant tell who hes looking to
Cause you all look the same everyone knows your name
And thats your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballers wife
You dont like players
Thats what you say
But you really wouldnt mind a millionaire
You dont like ballers
They dont do nothing for ya
But youd love a rich man sixfoottwo or taller
Youre more than a fan lookin for a man
But you end up with onenight stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning youre vexed
Hes on to the next
And you didnt even get no text
Dont be too upset if they call you a sket
Cause like the news every day you get pressed
You dont like players
Thats what you say
But you really wouldnt mind a millionaire
All them big ballers
Dont do nothing for ya
But youd love a rich man sixfoottwo or taller


You cant sit down right cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned
Without girls like you thered be no fun
Wed go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you theres no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Dont be mad at me cause youre pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps
