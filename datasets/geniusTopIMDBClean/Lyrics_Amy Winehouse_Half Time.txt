Half Time Lyrics[Verse 1]
Simple, sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you wonâ€™t get the chance

[Chorus]
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
[Verse 2]
Rhythm floods my heart
The melody, it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift

[Chorus]
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change

[Verse 3]
My lyrics revealing some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid-back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take, yeah
So, I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache, yeah

Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change7Embed
