Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I cant help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you wont get the chance
Halftime time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime time to think it through
Consider the change
Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
Cause the music is a gift
And its stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift
Halftime time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime time to think it through
Consider the change
My lyrics revealing some natural vibe
Its a kind of laidback feeling
Oh just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
Its too much to take yeah
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache yeah


Halftime time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Halftime time to think it through
Consider the change
