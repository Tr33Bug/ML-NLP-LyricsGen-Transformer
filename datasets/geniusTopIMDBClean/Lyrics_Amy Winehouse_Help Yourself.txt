When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They much too big but I dont care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathise
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you youre so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides nobody can be that wise
I cant help you if you wont help yourself  Help yourself help yourself 
I cant help you if you dont help yourself  Help yourself no no no 
You can only get so much from someone else  You can only get so much from me 
I cant help you if you wont help yourself  You wont help yourself 
You got a degree in philosophy  Philosophy 
So you  think you cleverer than me  Cause you so smart 
But Im not just some drama queen  Drama queen 
Cause its where youre at not where youve been
So what do you expect from me  What do you want 
To hold your head above the sea  Keep you high and dry 
And carry you even though you bigger
Cause dont you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway we still so young  Yeah Im so young 
And this isnt yesterday
I cant help you if you wont help yourself  I cant help you 
No I cant help you if you dont help yourself  You wont help yourself 
You can only get so much from someone else
I cant help you if you wont help yourself
You might be twentyfive but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most the time
And I Im just a child and you full grown
And it was like nothing that Ive ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knew
