Help Yourself Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
They much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathise
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you're so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides, nobody can be that wise
[Chorus]
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (Help yourself, help yourself)
I can't help you if you don't help yourself (Help yourself, no, no, no)
You can only get so much from someone else (You can only get so much from me)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (You won't help yourself)

[Verse 2]
You got a degree in philosophy (Philosophy)
So you  think you clever-er than me ('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been
So, what do you expect from me? (What do you want?)
To hold your head above the sea? (Keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure?
And, anyway, we still so young (Yeah, I'm so young)
And this isn't yesterday

[Chorus]
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (I can't help you)
No, I can't help you if you don't help yourself (You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

[Verse 3]
You might be twenty-five, but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most the time
And I, I'm just a child and you full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knewYou might also like7Embed
