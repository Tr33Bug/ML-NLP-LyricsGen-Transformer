I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco when everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your wornout dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now hes taken your freedom for a taste unknown
But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your wornout dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong
Hey little rich girl youve been away for so long
And now little rich girl I wrote you in this song
Hey little rich girl baby love is gone
And now little rich girl I know where you belong
At your dads office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache because the screen star was you
You left for London when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes just living on a dream
But you were just a rich girl and only having fun
Your wornout dresses drew stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl where did you go wrong
