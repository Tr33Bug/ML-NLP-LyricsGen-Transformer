I couldnt resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
Hes just not as tall
But I couldnt tell
It was dark and I was lying down
You are everything
He means nothing to me
I cant even remember his name
Whyre you so upset
Baby you werent there
And I was thinking of you when I came
What do you expect
You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed your touch
Dont overreact I pretended he was you
You wouldnt want me to be lonely
How can I put it so you understand
I didnt let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No he wasnt you
But you can still trust me this aint infidelity
Its not cheating you were on my mind
Yes he looked like you
But I heard love is blind
