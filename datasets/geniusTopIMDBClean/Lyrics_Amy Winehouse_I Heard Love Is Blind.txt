I Heard Love Is Blind Lyrics[Verse 1]
I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall
But I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

[Verse 2]
You are everything
He means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there
And I was thinking of you when I came
[Verse 3]
What do you expect?
You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed your touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely
How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No, he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating, you were on my mind

[Outro]
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blindYou might also like7Embed
