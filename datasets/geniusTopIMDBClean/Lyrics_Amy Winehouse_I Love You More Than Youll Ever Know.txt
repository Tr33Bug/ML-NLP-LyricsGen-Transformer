If I ever leave ya baby
You can say I told you so
And if I ever hurt ya
I hurt myself as well
Now is there any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want my loved one gone
Said I love you more than youll ever know
More than youll ever know
When I wasnt making too much money
You know where my paycheck went
I brought it home to ya baby
I never spent one red cent
Now is there any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want my loved one gone
I said I love you more than youll ever know
More than youll ever know
Im not trying to be just any kinda man
Im just tryna to be somebody
That you can love trust and understand
I know I know I know I can be
A part of you no one else could see yeah
But I got to hear ya say Ive got to hear ya say Its alright
Im only flesh and blood
But I can be anything that you demand
I could be king of everything
Or just a tiny grain of sand
Now is there any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want my loved one gone
Said I love you more than youll ever know oh
I dont want nobody else I dont need nobody else
Oh I love ya more than youll ever know
