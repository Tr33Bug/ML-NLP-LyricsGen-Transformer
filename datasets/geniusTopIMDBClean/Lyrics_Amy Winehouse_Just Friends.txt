TranslationsFranais
When will we get the time to be just friends
Its never safe for us not even in the evening
Cause Ive been drinking
Not in the morning where your shit works
Its always dangerous when everybodys sleeping
And Ive been thinking
Can we be alone
Can we be alone
When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends
And no Im not ashamed but the guilt will kill you
If she dont first
Ill never love you like her
Though we need to find the time to just do this shit together
For it gets worse
I wanna touch you but that just hurts
When will we get the time to be just just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends just friends
Just friends
