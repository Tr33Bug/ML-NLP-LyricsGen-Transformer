Youre just a little boy underneath that hat
You need the nerve to hide your ego dont come with that
You think everything gets handed to you free
But its not that easy no
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then
My girl says Im too sensitive to run with you
But Im not listenin to her mm
Yes Im perceptive so when Im done with you
Youll wish your head back the way it were
As you were
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then
Oh ohohoh Im not ruling you out Im just in doubt
As to what you say youre all about yeah
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and then
I gotta know you now and then
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
Ooh  Ooh
