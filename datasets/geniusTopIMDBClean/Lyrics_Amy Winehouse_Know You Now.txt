Know You Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need the nerve to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything gets handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

[Chorus]
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then
[Verse 2]
My girl says I'm too sensitive to run with you
But I'm not listenin' to her, mm
Yes, I'm perceptive, so when I'm done with you
You'll wish your head back the way it were
As you were

[Chorus]
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

[Skat Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, I'm not ruling you out, I'm just in doubt
As to what you say you're all about, yeah

[Chorus]
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and then
I gotta know you now and then

[Outro]
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
I got to know you now
We may never meet again
