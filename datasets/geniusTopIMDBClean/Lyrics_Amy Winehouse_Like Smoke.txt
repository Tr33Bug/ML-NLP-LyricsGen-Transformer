I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Dont want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah ohh
Its not a movie this is not a script to proofread
I spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies
Fun to punctuate pronounciate the funds I make
The miles I take put in your face
Oh my mistake youre not a floozy then excuse me
Before I talk my style introduce me
Get your name and phone number like 123
Yall know the story yall know the commentary
I kick the narrative this is legendary
The good Samaritan hood thespian
Like a polygamist with a twist
Will I marry again Maybe I guess
I hold a ladys interest I just met
The love scholar shes the teachers pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant no strings just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London Camden
Huntin for the answers why did God take away the homie
I cant stand it
Im a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why Cause Im deemed a heart breaker
Like smoke girls linger round a player yeah yuh
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Dont want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke I hang around in the unbalanced
Woah ohh
Yo this recession is a test
Its affectin my complexion
Misdirectin my affection
My concerns of bill collections
The facts is the taxes they after me
Chapter three my property
My handlers they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like Im IEG
Theres fly suites and my bourgeoisie
Tall freak she wouldnt protest with me at Wall Street
She says No youre so deep
I said No lets go through it
Historically so ruthless Feds came for Joe Louis
She said My man you need to laugh sometimes
Classifies me as a bore I told her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy in her dismay
Shes thinkin thats just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin he drags his ass on the ground all day
And its a dragon its a bastard youre in tune with just lust
Im through with you after I crush
So is that humorous enough
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura Funky Buddah Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet some Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say Yeah
You know how me and Amy are straight players
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Dont want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah ohh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
