TranslationsFranais
For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Fivestory fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wished I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Selfprofessed profound
Til the chips were down
Know youre a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
