TranslationsFranaisMe  Mr Jones Lyrics
Nobody stands in between me and my man
Its me and Mr Jones
Me and Mr Jones 
What kind of fuckery is this
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig  Oh Slick Rick 
And thought I didnt love you when I did  When I did 
Cant believe you played me out like that
No you aint worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss  All them girls 
You cant keep lying to yourself like this  To yourself 
Cant believe you played yourself  Out  like this
Rulers one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
Cause its me and Mr Jones
Me and Mr Jones 
What kind of fuckery are we
Nowadays you dont mean dick to me  Dick to me 
I might let you make it up to me  Make it up 
Whos playing Saturday
What kind of fuckery are you
Side from Sammy youre my best black Jew  Best black Jew 
But I could swear that we were through  We were through 
I still wonder bout the things you do
Mr Destiny 9 and 14
Nobody stands in between me and my man
Cause its me and Mr Jones
Mr Jones  Me and Mr Jones 
Me and oh
