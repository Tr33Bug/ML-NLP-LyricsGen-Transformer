There I go there I go there I go there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time youre near me
I never can behave
You give me the smile and then Im wrapped up in your magic
Theres music all around me
Crazy music music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you turns me your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby just let me get next to you
So am I insane or do I really see Heaven in your eyes
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue skies how I worry about you
Just cant live my life without you
Baby come here dont have no fear
Oh is there a wonder why
Im really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why stop to think about this weather my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby wont you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one Im not afraid Im not afraid
Now if theres a cloud up above us
Come on and let it rain
Im sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh my baby wont you please let me love you
And give relief from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me my sweet
I am not afraid not anymore not like before
Cant you understand me now baby please
Pull yourself together do it soon
My souls on fire come on and take me
Ill be what you make me my darling my sweet
Oh baby you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let me visit out there in that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a lovin state of mind
Im so tired of being without it
And never know what loves about
Vince Henry you can come on hit me
Then you can blow now if you want to Im through
