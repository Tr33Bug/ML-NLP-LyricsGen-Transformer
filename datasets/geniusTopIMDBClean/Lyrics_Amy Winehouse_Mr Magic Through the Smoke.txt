Mr Magic  Through the Smoke  Lyrics
Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school
Mister Magic  Take a token
Mister Magic  Of my love
Mister Magic  I see you through the smoke
Without you Im misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when youre next to me
Yeah cause you come naturally
Mister Magic  Take a token
Mister Magic  Of my love love love
Mister Magic  I see you through the smoke
Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through
Mister Magic  Take a token
Mister Magic  Of my love
Mister Magic  Mister Magic
I see you through the smoke
Mister Magic 
Mister Magic 
Mister Magic 
Waiting for the smoke to clear
Im waiting for the smoke to clear
