Mr Magic (Through the Smoke) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Every day, I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school

[Chorus]
(Mister Magic) Take a token
(Mister Magic) Of my love
(Mister Magic) I see you through the smoke
[Verse 2]
Without you, I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally

[Chorus]
(Mister Magic) Take a token
(Mister Magic) Of my love, love, love
(Mister Magic) I see you through the smoke

[Verse 3]
Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh, you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through

[Chorus]
(Mister Magic) Take a token
(Mister Magic) Of my love
(Mister Magic) Mister Magic
I see you through the smoke

[Outro]
(Mister Magic)
(Mister Magic)
(Mister Magic)
Waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clearYou might also like10Embed
