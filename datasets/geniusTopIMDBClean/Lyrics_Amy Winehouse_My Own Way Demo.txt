My Own Way  Demo  Lyrics
Ive never been in love before
Such a foolish thing to be
Seems to me the price is high
So Ill keep my own company
And Ill do what I want when I feel
Watch them fall so easily
Temporary insanity
Some say that true love is blind
Me I like to clarify
While I I just take my own time and I
Ill go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
Seems to be illogical
Love thats unconditional yeah
Give your all to someone else
But save a little for yourself
Thats why Im Im taking my own time and Im
Ill go my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna yeah
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk talk when I wanna
Dont get me wrong its kinda cynical
But it scares me though
So Im careful with my heart
Its the only one I got
I cannot commit to that shit
Ill go my own way  Oh yeah 
Ill talk when I wanna
Finding my own way
I walk when I wanna
Talk I talk when I wanna
Ill go my own way  Ill go my own way 
And Ill walk when I wanna and tell you when I wanna
My own way my own way yeah yeah  Ill go my own way 
When I wanna when I wanna when I wanna
