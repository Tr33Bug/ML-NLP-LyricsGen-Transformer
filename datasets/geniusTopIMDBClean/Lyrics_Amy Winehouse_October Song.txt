Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sang her Lullaby of Birdland every night
I sang a lullaby every night
Sang for my Ava every night
Ava was the morning now shes gone
Shes reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise
With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird my beautiful bird
Spoke until one day she couldnt be heard
She spoke until one day she couldnt be heard
She just stopped singing
Ava was the morning now shes gone
Shes reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise
Ava was the morning now shes gone
Shes reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise
She flies in paradise
