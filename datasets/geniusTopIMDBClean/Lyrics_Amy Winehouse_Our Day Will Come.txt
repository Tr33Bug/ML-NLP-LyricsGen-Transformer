Our day will come  Our day will come 
And well have everything
Well share the joy  Well share the joy 
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me
That Im too young to know  Young to know 
I love you so  Love you so 
And you love me
Our day will come  Our day will come 
If we just wait a while
No tears for us  No tears for us 
Think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic
Because well always stay in love this way
Our day will come
Our day will come our day will come 
Our dreams have magic
Because well always stay in love this way
Our day will come
Our day will come our day will come 
Our day will come
Our day will come our day will come 
Our day will come
Our day will come our day will come 
Our day will come
Our day will come our day will come 
Our day will come
