Rehab  Remix  Lyrics
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said No no no
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
I aint got the time and if my daddy thinks Im fine
Hes tried to make me go to rehab but I wont go go go
Id rather be at home with Ray
I aint got seventy days
Cause theres nothing
Theres nothing you can teach me
That I cant learn from Mr Hathaway
I didnt get a lot in class
But I know it dont come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no no no
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
Now rocking with the best Amy baby 
The man said Why do you think you here  Oh oh 
I said I got no idea
Im gonna Im gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near  Oh oh 
He said I just think your depressed
The best Amy Amy 
Kiss me yeah baby and go rest
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said No no no  Yes 
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
Young uh
More money more checks Im addicted to fresh
Six pair of kicks is my definition of twelve steps
Kick back in the Bach get the Phantom to drop
Bass blaring outta my system thats how I detox
Oh when will he stop He still pumping that real shit
My flow so dumb my face is numb nigga I dont feel shit
Wheres a therapist Yeah Im outta control
They tryna make me go to rehab I wont go no
And so Im addicted Im Britney Whitney and Bobby
Betty Ford aint ready for us aint nothing can stop me
Oh look hes collapsing just look how hes rapping
Every time I try to get out it pulls me back in
Amy should have rehabd him stead she doubled his ration
Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion
My heron flows more lethal than Marilyns nose
Ima OD til Im in peace like Anna Nicole
Hov
I dont ever wanna drink again
I just ooh I just need a friend
Im not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think Im on the mend
Its not just my pride
Its just til these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab but I wont go go go
