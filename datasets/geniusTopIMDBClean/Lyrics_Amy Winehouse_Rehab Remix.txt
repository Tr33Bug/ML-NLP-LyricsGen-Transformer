Rehab (Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: Amy Winehouse]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go

[Verse 1: Amy Winehouse]
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

[Chorus: Amy Winehouse & JAY-Z]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said "no, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know know
(Now rocking with the best, Amy, baby)

[Verse 2: Amy Winehouse & JAY-Z]
The man said, "Why do you think you here?" (Oh, oh)
I said, "I got no idea"
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near (Oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Amy Winehouse & JAY-Z]
He said, "I just think your depressed"
(The best Amy, Amy)
Kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest

[Chorus: Amy Winehouse, JAY-Z, Both]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said "No, no, no" (Yes)
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Young, uh
More money, more checks, I'm addicted to fresh
Six pair of kicks is my definition of twelve steps
Kick back in the 'Bach, get the Phantom to drop
Bass blaring outta my system, that's how I detox
Oh, when will he stop? He still pumping that real shit
My flow so dumb, my face is numb, nigga, I don't feel shit
Where's a therapist? Yeah, I'm outta control
They tryna make me go to rehab, I won't go, no
And so I'm addicted, I'm Britney, Whitney, and Bobby
Betty Ford ain't ready for us, ain't nothing can stop me
Oh, look he's collapsing, just look how he's rapping
Every time I try to get out, it pulls me back in
Amy should have rehab'd him, 'stead she doubled his ration
Can you blame me for being a slave to my passion?
My her-on flow's more lethal than Marilyn's nose
I'ma OD 'til I'm in peace like Anna Nicole
Hov'!

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

[Pre-Chorus 3]
It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried

[Outro: Amy Winehouse]
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go1Embed
