They tried to make me go to rehab but I said No no no
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
I aint got the time and if my daddy thinks Im fine
Hes tried to make me go to rehab but I wont go go go
Id rather be at home with Ray
I aint got seventy days
Cause theres nothing theres nothing you can teach me
That I cant learn from Mr Hathaway
I didnt get a lot in class
But I know it dont come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said No no no
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
I aint got the time and if my daddy thinks Im fine
Hes tried to make me go to rehab but I wont go go go
The man said Why do you think you here
I said I got no idea
Im gonna Im gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said I just think youre depressed
This me Yeah baby and the rest
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said No no no
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
I dont ever wanna drink again
I just ooh I just need a friend
Im not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think Im on the mend
Its not just my pride
Its just till these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said No no no
Yes Ive been black but when I come back youll know know know
I aint got the time and if my daddy thinks Im fine
Hes tried to make me go to rehab but I wont go go go
