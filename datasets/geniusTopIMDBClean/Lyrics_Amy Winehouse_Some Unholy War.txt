TranslationsFranais
If my man was fightin some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didnt know
Its you Im fightin for
He cant lose with me in tow  With me in tow 
I refuse to let him go  To let him go 
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow
We put it in writin
But who you writin for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done recitin
My stomach standin still
Like youre readin my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And Ill battle til this bitter finale  Bitter finale 
Just me my dignity and this guitar case woah woah
Yes yes my mans fightin some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dyin for
B I would have died too
Id  like to
If my man was fightin some unholy war
Yeah if my man was fightin
