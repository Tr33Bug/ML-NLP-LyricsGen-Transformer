TranslationsFran√ßaisSome Unholy War Lyrics[Verse 1]
If my man was fightin' some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fightin' for
He can't lose with me in tow (With me in tow)
I refuse to let him go (To let him go)
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow
[Verse 2]
We put it in writin'
But who you writin' for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done, recitin'
My stomach standin' still
Like you're readin' my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale (Bitter finale)
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, woah, woah

[Verse 3]
Yes, yes, my man's fightin' some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dyin' for?
B, I would have died, too
I'd  like to
If my man was fightin' some unholy war
Yeah, if my man was fightin'You might also like8Embed
