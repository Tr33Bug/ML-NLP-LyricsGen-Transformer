Your neighbours were screaming
I dont have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers
Hoping you wouldnt be there
And now my heads hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And Id have wanted to stay
But I got nothing to say
You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say
Man that was ugly
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box put it in the box 
Franks in there and I dont care
Put it in the box put it in the box 
Just take it take the box
Take the box
I came home this evening
And nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter
But thats not me you know me
Feel so fucking angry dont wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Misterfalsepretence you dont make sense
I just dont know you
But you make me cry wheres my kiss goodbye
I think I love you


The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box put it in the box 
Franks in there I dont care
Put it in the box put it in the box 
Now take it take the box
Just take it take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box
