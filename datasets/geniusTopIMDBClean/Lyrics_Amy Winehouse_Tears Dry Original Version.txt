Tears Dry  Original Version  Lyrics
All I can ever be to you is the darkness we once knew
And this deep regret I had to get accustomed to
Once it felt so right anticipation at its height
Lived and waited in hotel rooms late at night
I knew I hadnt met my match
With every moment we could snatch
I dont know why I let myself get so attached
Its my responsibility
And you dont owe nothing to me
But to cut myself off I had no capacity
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I am grown
And in your grey in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own  Tears dry on their own 
I dont understand why do I stress the man
When theres so many bigger things than him at hand
We couldve never had it all
We had to hit a wall
And this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
Ill be some next mans other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I am grown
And in your grey in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own  Tears dry on their own 
Wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
And as we kiss goodbye the sun behind you sets
So we are history your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I am grown
And in your grey in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own  Tears dry on their own 
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I am grown
Baby in your grey in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own  Tears dry on their own 
Yeah in your grey this cool shade
My tears dry on their own  Tears dry on their own 
In your grey in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own  Tears dry on their own 
In your grey in this cool shade
My tears dry on their own  Tears dry on their own
