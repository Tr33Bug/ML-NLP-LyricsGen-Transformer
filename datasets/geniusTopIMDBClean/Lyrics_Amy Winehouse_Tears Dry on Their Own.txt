TranslationsFranais
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret Ive got accustomed to
Once it was so right when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadnt met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I dont know why I got so attached
Its my responsibility
And you dont owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im grown  Im grown 
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I dont understand why do I stress the man
When theres so many bigger things at hand
We couldve never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
Ill be some next mans other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im grown  Im grown 
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im grown
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im grown  Im grown 
And in your way my blue shade
My tears dry on their own
Woah he walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I am grown
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry on their own woah
He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but Im grown
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry
