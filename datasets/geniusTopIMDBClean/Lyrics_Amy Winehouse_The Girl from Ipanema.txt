The Girl from Ipanema Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes
Goes laboo-du-di-daa
When she walks, it's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes laboo-du-di-daa

[Chorus]
Oh, how I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
[Verse 2]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I go
The girl, the girl, the girl
From Ipanema, from Ipanema

[Scat]

[Chorus]
Oh, how I want her so badly
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Verse 3]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile
But she doesn't see
She ain't looking at meYou might also like2Embed
