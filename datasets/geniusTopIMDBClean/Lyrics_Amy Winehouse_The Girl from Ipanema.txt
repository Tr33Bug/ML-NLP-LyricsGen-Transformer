Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes
Goes laboodudidaa
When she walks its just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes each one she passes
Goes laboodudidaa
Oh how I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I go
The girl the girl the girl
From Ipanema from Ipanema
Oh how I want her so badly
How how can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I smile
But she doesnt see
She aint looking at me
