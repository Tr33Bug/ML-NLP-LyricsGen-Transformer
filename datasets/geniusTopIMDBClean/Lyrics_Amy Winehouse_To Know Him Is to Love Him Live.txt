To Know Him Is to Love Him  Live  Lyrics
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do I do I do
Oh Ill be good to him
Ill bring joy to him
Oh oh everyone says therell come a day
When Ill walk alongside of him
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do I really do I do
Why cant he see
How blind can he be
Someday hell see
That he was meant for me
Oh oh to know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Oh it makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do I really do and I do
