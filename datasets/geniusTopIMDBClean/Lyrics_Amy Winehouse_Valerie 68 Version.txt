Valerie  68 Version  Lyrics
One two 
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what youre doin
And in my head I paint a picture
Since Ive come home
Well my bodys been a mess
And Ive missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Wont you come on over
Stop makin a fool out of me
Why dont you come on over Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer
Hope you didnt catch a ten
I hope youll find the right man who fix it for ya
Are you shopping anywhere
Change the colour of your hair
Are you busy
And did you have to pay the fine you were dodgin all the time
Are you still dizzy
Cause since Ive come home
Well my bodys been a mess
And Ive missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Wont you come on over
Stop makin a fool out of me
Why dont you come on over Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie


Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what youre doin
And in my head I paint a picture
Cause since Ive come home
Well my bodys been a mess
And Ive missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Wont you come on over
Stop makin a fool out of me
Why dont you come on over Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Oh Valerie Valerie Valerie
Valerie
