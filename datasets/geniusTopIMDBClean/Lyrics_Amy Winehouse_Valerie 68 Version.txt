Valerie (â€™68 Version) Lyrics[Intro]
(One, two)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture

[Chorus]
Since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
[Verse 1]
Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a ten
I hope you'll find the right man who fix it for ya

[Verse 2]
Are you shopping anywhere?
Change the colour of your hair?
Are you busy?
And did you have to pay the fine you were dodgin' all the time?
Are you still dizzy?

[Chorus]
'Cause since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture

[Chorus]
'Cause since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
