TranslationsTrkeValerie  BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge  Lyrics
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what youre doin
And in my head I paint a picture
And since Ive come home
Well my bodys been a mess
And Ive missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Wont you come on over
Stop makin a fool out of me
Why dont you come on over Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Did you have to go to jail
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer
Hope you didnt catch a ten
I hope youll find the right man who fix it for ya
And are you shoppin anywhere  Ahah 
Change the colour of your hair  Ahah 
And are you busy  Ahah ahah 
And did you have to pay that fine  Ahah 
You were dodging all the time  Ahah 
Are you still dizzy  Ahah ahah 
And since Ive come home
Well my bodys been a mess
And Ive missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Wont you come on over
Stop makin a fool out of me
Why dont you come on over Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what youre doin
And in my head I paint a picture
And since Ive come home
Well my bodys been a mess
And Ive missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Wont you come on over
Stop makin a fool out of me
Why dont you come on over Valerie
Valerie yeah

Oh Valerie
Oh Valerie
Oh Valerie
Valerie ayy

Why dont you come on over Valerie
