TranslationsTürkçeValerie (BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture

[Chorus]
And since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool, out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie
[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a ten
I hope you'll find the right man who fix it for ya

[Verse 2]
And are you shoppin' anywhere? (Ah-ah)
Change the colour of your hair? (Ah-ah)
And are you busy? (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
And did you have to pay that fine (Ah-ah)
You were dodging all the time? (Ah-ah)
Are you still dizzy? (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

[Chorus]
And since I've come home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool, out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie
