TranslationsFranais
Its okay in the day Im staying busy
Tied up enough so I dont have to wonder Where is he
Got so sick of crying so just lately
When I catch myself I do a 180
I stay up clean the house at least Im not drinking
Run around just so I dont have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets
Hes fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
As far as my heart Id rather be restless
Second I stop the sleep catches up and Im breathless
Cause this ache in my chest cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold I stand before him  Before him 
Its all I can do to assure him  Assure him 
When he comes to me I drip for him tonight
Drowning me we bathe under blue light  Under blue 
Hes fierce in my dreams seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
