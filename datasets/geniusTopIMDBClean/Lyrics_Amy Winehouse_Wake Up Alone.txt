TranslationsFran√ßaisWake Up Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's okay in the day, I'm staying busy
Tied up enough, so I don't have to wonder, "Where is he?"
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself, I do a 180
I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets

[Chorus]
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
[Verse 2]
As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless
Second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest, 'cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold, I stand before him (Before him)
It's all I can do to assure him (Assure him)
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight
Drowning me, we bathe under blue light (Under blue)

[Chorus]
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone

[Outro]
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up aloneYou might also like20Embed
