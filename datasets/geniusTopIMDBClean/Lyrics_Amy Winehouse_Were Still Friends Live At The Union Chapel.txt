Hello friend
How has it been
Aint it wonderful youve got a friend
Cause though weve changed in our endeavors
I found we still have some things in common
Now aint it strange and wonderful
That were still friends
Were were still friends
Through our heart we never parted
And through our living
Was friends as friends friendships all
And the way we are when were together
Lets us know that we still love one another oh
Now aint it strange and wonderful
That were were still friends
Were still friends
Were still friends
Were still friends
