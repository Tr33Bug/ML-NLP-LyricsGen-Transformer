Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never ever go through it firsthand
Emulate all the shit my mother hates
I cant help but demonstrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself it fails to die
And animal aggression is my downfall
I dont care about what you got I want it all
Its bricked up in my head its shoved under my bed
And I question myself again What is it bout men
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again What is it bout men
What is it bout men
Im nurturing I just wanna do my thing
And Ill take the wrong man as naturally as I sing
And Ill save my tears for uncovering my fears
Our behavioural patterns that stick over the years
Cause its bricked up in my head its shoved under my bed
And I question myself again What is it bout men
Now my destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again What is it bout men
Ooh its bricked up in my head and its shoved under my bed
And I question myself again What is it bout men
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again What is it bout men
What is it bout men
