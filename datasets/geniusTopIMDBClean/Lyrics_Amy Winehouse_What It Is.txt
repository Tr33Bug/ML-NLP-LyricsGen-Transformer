I can see you ahead of me
But Im not always forwardthinking
Ill tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what Ive been drinking
Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know what it is
Nowadays we talk too much
Like youre forgetting all the good shit
You decide whats wrong with me
I always used to let you say
But now I like to think out loud
Youre running with some different crowd
We both know what it is
I dont know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And Im so tired I cant even cry cry
Misterultrasensitive
Ill never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So Im sorry if I upset you
Tomorrow is another day so Ill call you cause thats okay
We both know what it is
I dont know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
I live my life and your attitude become a bore
And Im so tired I cant even cry
I cant even cry
Relationship dust and remains
We resonate on different planes
I could cut you down again
If you was like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend but my friend
I dont know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
I live my life
Your attitude become a bore
And Im so tired I cant even cry
I dont know you anymore
Supposed to be the man that I live my life by
Oh your attitude become a bore
And Im so tired I cant even cry ooh
