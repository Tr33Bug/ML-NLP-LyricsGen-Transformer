Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow  2011  Lyrics
Tonight youre mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moments pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Yeah
Tonight with words unspoken
And you said that Im the only one the only one yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night  When the night  meets  Meets the morning  the morning star
Id like to know that your love is love I can be sure of ooh yeah
So tell me now cause I wont ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow 
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow Ooh
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow 
Will you still love me
