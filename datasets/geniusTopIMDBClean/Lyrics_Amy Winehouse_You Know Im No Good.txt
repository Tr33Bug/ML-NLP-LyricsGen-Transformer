TranslationsFranais
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull tshirt
You say What did you do with him today
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
Cause youre my fella my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time Im out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
Upstairs in bed with my exboy
Hes in the place but I cant get joy
Thinkin on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet ya chips and pita
You say When we married
Cause youre not bitter
Therell be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
Sweet reunion Jamaica and Spain
Were like how we were again
Im in the tub you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug and its the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first


I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that Im no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah you know that Im no good
