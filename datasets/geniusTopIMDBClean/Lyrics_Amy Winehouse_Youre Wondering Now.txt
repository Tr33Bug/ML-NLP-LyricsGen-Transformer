Youre wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end
Youre wondering how you will pay
For the way you misbehaved
First time I swallowed
Now youre on your own
I wont return
Forever you will wait
Youre wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end
First time I swallowed
Now youre on your own
I wont return
Forever you will wait
Youre wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end
Youre wondering how you will pay
For the way you misbehaved
Youre wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end
Youre wondering how you will pay
For the way you misbehaved
