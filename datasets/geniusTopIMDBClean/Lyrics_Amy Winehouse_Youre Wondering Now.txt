Youâ€™re Wondering Now Lyrics[Chorus]
You're wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end
You're wondering how you will pay
For the way you misbehaved

[Verse]
First time, I swallowed
Now you're on your own
I won't return
Forever, you will wait
[Refrain]
You're wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end

[Verse]
First time, I swallowed
Now you're on your own
I won't return
Forever, you will wait

[Chorus]
You're wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end
You're wondering how you will pay
For the way you misbehaved
You're wondering now what to do
Now you know this is the end
You're wondering how you will pay
For the way you misbehavedYou might also like3Embed
