ADI  Horror of It All Lyrics
Its just too damn easy to die in this life
Whos making the decisions
Tell me whos got the right
Woah oh oh my grief turns to anger
Woah oh oh its time to
Say goodbye its a horror
Memories nothings harder
I know theres no answer I mean what did I expect
So many unanswered questions
I cant believe I cant accept
Woah oh oh my anger turns to hatred
Woah oh oh Its time to
Say goodbye its a horror
Memories nothings harder
Woah oh oh the horror of it all
The horror of it all Im gonna break
The horror of it all tell me why
Youre not supposed to question but whys there so much pain
When someones taken from you
What can you do or say
Woah oh oh my hatred turns to violence
Woah oh oh its time to
Say goodbye its a horror
Memories nothings harder
Woah oh oh the horror of it all
The horror of it all Im gonna break
The horror of it all tell me why
Woah
Ahaha
Woah
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
Say goodbye Its such a horror
My memories theres nothing harder
Anger and hatred fill the page
Smash the walls its time to rage
The horror of it all
The horror of it all
Anger and hatred fill the page
Smash the walls its time to rage
