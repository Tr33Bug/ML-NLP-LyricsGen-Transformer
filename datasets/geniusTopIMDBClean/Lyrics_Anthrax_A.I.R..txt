AIR Lyrics
Young and free something youll never be
A childhoods end its lunacy
Pure dictation they dont listen
And youre just waiting for what youre missing
Welcome to your nightmare
You just cant walk away
Its time for you to choose your fate
You just cant let it lay
Welcome to our nightmare
Your whole lifes on the way today
Youre no good misunderstood
AIR
All their hopes and visions
Of what they want you to be
Crucial times made up minds
AIR
So high and mighty
Though much too blind to see
Who are you gonna live your life for
Conformity will trap you like a locked door
Independence means owning your decisions
Authority will put your soul in prison
Welcome to your nightmare
You just cant walk away
Its time for you to choose your fate
You just cant let it lay
Welcome to your nightmare
Your whole lifes on the way today
Youre no good misunderstood
AIR
All their hopes and visions
Of what they want you to be
Crucial times made up minds
AIR
So high and mighty
Though much too blind to see
Fight or go insane theres noone else to blame
Stop their influence you cant give them a chance
Break right through the wall that separates us all
Start your second life without their hands in sight
Oh
You got your pride
You got your visions
Dont subside dont ever give in no
Dont compromise just keep on grinning
The games they play
You just keep on winning
Keep on winning keep on winning
Keep on winning
AIR
