Disease disease
Spreading the disease
With some help from Captain Trips
Hell bring the world down to his knees
Power yes power
Hell show them all his power
It pulses through his ice cold blood
A whole world to devour
Hes seeing hes calling
His legacy hes spawning
Hes coming corrupting
Among the living
Murder murder
Commit coldblooded murder
Like Nazis during World War II
They only follow orders
Hatred hatred
A crucifix is your bed
Once he turns his eyes on you
Youd be better off dead
Hes seeing hes calling
His legacy hes spawning
Hes coming corrupting
Among the living
Im the walkin dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
Im the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die
Man fights man
Divided they cant stand
United they can battle back
And make him force his hand
Fear yes fear
His end is growing near
He didnt count on mans good faith
And their will to persevere


Hes seeing hes calling
His legacy hes spawning
Hes coming corrupting
Among the living
Im the walkin dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
Im the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die
Ahh
Fire hot fire
Purge the world with fire
Damnation is the price hell pay
For an evil mans desire
Good versus evil
The stand to vanquish evil
Man can only live one way
That place right in the middle
Hes seeing hes calling
His legacy hes spawning
Hes coming corrupting
Among the living
Im the walkin dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
Im the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die
Among among among among
Among among among among
Among among among among
Among among among among
