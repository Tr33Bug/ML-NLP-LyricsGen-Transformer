Among the Living Lyrics
Disease, disease!
Spreading the disease
With some help from Captain Trips
He'll bring the world down to his knees
Power, yes, power!
He'll show them all his power
It pulses through his ice cold blood
A whole world to devour

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
Murder, murder!
Commit cold-blooded murder
Like Nazis during World War II
They only follow orders
Hatred, hatred!
A crucifix is your bed
Once he turns his eyes on you
You'd be better off dead

He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die

Man, fights man!
Divided they can't stand
United they can battle back
And make him force his hand
Fear, yes, fear!
His end is growing near
He didn't count on man's good faith
And their will to persevere
You might also like
He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die

Ahh!

Fire, hot fire!
Purge the world with fire
Damnation is the price he'll pay
For an evil man's desire
Good versus evil!
The stand to vanquish evil
Man can only live one way
That place right in the middle
He's seeing, he's calling
His legacy he's spawning
He's coming, corrupting
Among the living

I'm the walkin' dude
I can see all the world
Twist your minds with fear
I'm the man with the power
Among the living
Follow me or die

Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!
Among, among, among, among!Embed
