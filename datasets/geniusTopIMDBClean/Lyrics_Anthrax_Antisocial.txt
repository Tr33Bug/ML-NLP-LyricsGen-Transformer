Youre a train ride to no importance
Youre in love with hell existence
The money is all that you desire
Why dont you pack it in and retire
Its common sense you cant fool me
Im just the money that you cant let free
Rainy day genius clouds your mind
Dont you realize the blind lead the blind
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
Oh mister time will you ever unwind
Or just rebuild a new design
Your claim to fame is law and order
The rich get rich the poor get poor
You put a price tag on what you see
This ones for you thats for me
If thats winning Id rather lose
Why dont you listen to my senseless views
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
How do you feel
Youre a train ride to no importance
Youre in love with hell existence
The money is all that you desire
Why dont you pack it in and retire
Its common sense you cant fool me
Im just the money that you cant let free
Rainy day genius clouds your mind
Dont you realize the blind lead the blind
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
Youre anti youre antisocial
