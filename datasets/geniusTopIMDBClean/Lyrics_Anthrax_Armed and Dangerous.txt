Ooh
Trapped up inside here
Like lions in a cage
Ive been a mark of injustice
Bound by these chains
I cant find a reason
On my own
My destiny waits for a sign from me
Im leaving alone
Yeah hey
So cold
Oh so cold
Oh Im out on my way now
Its been so many years
The chase is my lifeblood
I have no more fears
Fire burns in my veins
Anger shows on my face
Hatred poisons my soul
Look out Im about to explode
Evil ones try to destroy us
Were armed and prepared for attack
Well take on the world with rebellion
Were dangerous down to the last
Armed and dangerous
Ohoh armed and dangerous
Ooh am I evil or am I insane
The lion inside of me is no longer tame
A blade in my left ooh a gun in my right
To beat you within an inch of your life
Evil ones try to destroy us
Were armed and prepared for attack
Well take on the world with rebellion
Were dangerous down to the last
Armed and dangerous
Ohoh armed and dangerous
Ooh armed and dangerous
Oh armed and dangerous
So armed and dangerous
Ohoh armed and dangerous
Fire burns in my veins
Anger shows on my face
Hatred poisons my soul
Look out Im about to explode
Evil ones try to destroy us
Were armed and prepared for attack
Well take on the world with rebellion
Were dangerous down to the last
Armed and dangerous
Ohoh armed and dangerous
Oh armed and dangerous
Oh armed and dangerous
Ohohoh
