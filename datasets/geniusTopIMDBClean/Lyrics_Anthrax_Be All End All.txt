Yes no yes no
Not another word
Youll know what to do
Right in your face they see it
In their face you take it
Make up their minds
Aggression turns the screws
Fight take your place and hold it
Make your piece and stand up
You know what it means
Wake up time to live your dreams
Down by
Law and they cant hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideals
Down by
Law and noone owns you
And all the shit theyve thrown you
Payback is a real bitch
Nothings ever easy when you do it yourself
All you can do is try
Lifes not unfair lifes just life
Death not suicide
Be all and youll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Be all and youll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria


Think on your feet and stay one step ahead
Break take your brain and use it
Take their mind and change an attitude
Like youd change your shorts
Right in your face they see it
In their face you stand up
You know what it means
Wake up time to live your dreams
Down by
Law and they cant hold you
Dictate and control you
Hold onto your ideals
Down by
Law and noone owns you
And all the shit theyve thrown you
Payback is a real bitch
Nothings ever easy when you do it yourself
All you can do is try
Lifes not unfair lifes just life
Death not suicide
Be all and youll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Be all and youll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Always taking always faking
Ignorance is so frustrating
Always taking always faking
Ignorance is no way
No way no way no way out
Be all and youll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
Be all and youll be the end all
Life can be a real ball
State of mind
Euphoria
