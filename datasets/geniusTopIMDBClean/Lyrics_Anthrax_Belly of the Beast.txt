You walk this earth without a heart
You tear the innocent souls apart
You shovel your conscience in the grave
You walk this earth without a heart
Your uniform couldnt be taken off
A tattoo burned into your flesh
Your mind your voice
These are your instruments of death
How could you dare to be so bold
You only did as you were told
Marionettes dancing in time
To the apologetic lines
For all the monsters of our time
Who is evil who is blind
In the name of who youll find
A city of souls dying for peace
Welcome to the belly of the beast
One mind one voice
Welcome to the belly of the beast
Who hears your voice
Millions never never again
Madness never never again
Martyrs dead that cant die
Monsters
Insanity the normal state
The left hand a hammer the right the stake
Driven so deep into the heart
Its killing love its killing faith
Its killing cause its from the heart
What better way to demoralize
When your own children are your spies
The things you trust are not the same
Trust in death trust in grief trust in hope is trust in pain
Who is evil who is blind
In the name of who youll find
A city of souls dying for peace
Welcome to the belly of the beast
One mind one voice
Welcome to the belly of the beast
Who hears your voice
Millions never never again
Madness never never again
Martyrs dead that cant die
Monsters
Who is evil who is blind
In the name of who youll find
Youre not supposed to question faith
But how do you accept this faith
Millions you walk this earth without a heart
Madness tear the innocent souls apart
Martyrs shovel your conscience into the grave
Monsters
A city of souls dying for peace
Welcome to the belly of the beast
One mind one voice
Welcome to the belly of the beast
Who hears your voice
This is the belly of the beast
And all the souls dying for peace
Inside the belly of the beast
Millions never never again
Madness never never again
Martyrs dead that cant die
Monsters
