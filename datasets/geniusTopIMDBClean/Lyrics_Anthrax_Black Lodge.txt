Black Lodge Lyrics
Worship the ground you barely walk on
You give of yourself
But your angels are gone
Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul
They're bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again

I am a witness to your demise
Your biggest secret is one you can't keep
Lift up your head if you're only asleep
You try to hold on to reason
Why can't you see that you're leaving?
My love for you knows no distance
But it can't fight your resistance

I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies

Give me
The one thing you can't give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live
Give me
The one thing you can't give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live

Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul
They're bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again
You might also like
I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies
My love has always been blind

Give me
The one thing you can't give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live
Give me
The one thing you can't give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live

Where you live
Where you live
Where you live
Where you liveEmbed
