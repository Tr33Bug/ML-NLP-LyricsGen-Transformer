Worship the ground you barely walk on
You give of yourself
But your angels are gone
Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul
Theyre bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again
I am a witness to your demise
Your biggest secret is one you cant keep
Lift up your head if youre only asleep
You try to hold on to reason
Why cant you see that youre leaving
My love for you knows no distance
But it cant fight your resistance
I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies
Give me
The one thing you cant give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live
Give me
The one thing you cant give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live
Deny your body is screaming
But your heart and your soul
Theyre bleeding
Just to fall asleep is a godsend
Until your demons appear again
I am a witness to your demise
I am the one who saw through the lies
My love has always been blind
Give me
The one thing you cant give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live
Give me
The one thing you cant give
Take me to
The black lodge where you live
Where you live
Where you live
Where you live
Where you live
