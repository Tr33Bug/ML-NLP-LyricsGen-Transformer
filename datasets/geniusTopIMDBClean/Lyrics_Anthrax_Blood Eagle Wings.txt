Everythings been said walk among the dead you can see my crimes this is my design
Theres no right or wrong its the same old song just keeps pounding me hits so hard
Hell is empty cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly hit so hard
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
My whole world built on bodies dead and gone you ignored the signs that was my design
And the loneliness hits so hard in this grey place that exists in my mind
Hell is empty cause all my demons are here
Ever so deadly hit so hard
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
I ask you
Why why fight everything
Why cant you accept it
You can never stop it
And I dont want to try
A weak half measured lie
Id rather see it die
Id rather see it die
I showed you
Why why fight everything
Not what you expected
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I dont have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
Id rather see it die
Id rather see it die


I showed you
Why why fight everything
Not what you expected
Your dystopian epic
Of memories are a lie
I dont have to try
Unfold your wings and fly
Id rather see it die
Id rather see it die
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
I show you
I ask you
I show you
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
I ask you
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
I show you
Darkness in my soul is taking hold and becoming
I ask you
Break me from this hold as I unfold blood eagle wings
