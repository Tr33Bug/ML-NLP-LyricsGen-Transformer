What do you do when something dies
A life together has ended youre living a lie
When did this act become reality
Hello conscience do I laugh or do I cry
Nothings ever perfect
This is just a test
Imagine imagine saying what can be said
Imagine imagine each word a bullet till youre dead
Imagine imagine killing something your love
Imagine just think about living inside
Blood on your hands blood in my eyes
Blood I cant keep blood circumscribes
Blood on your hands blood in my eyes
Blood I cant keep blood circumscribes
Blood on your hands turns into blood in my eyes
And with the blood I cant keep our lives blood circumscribes
Blood on your hands turns into blood in my eyes
And with the blood I cant keep our lives blood circumscribes
Brother on brother on brother on brother on
Brother on brother on brother on brothers in blood
A wave of hatred comes like the flood
Brother on brother on brothers in blood
A wave of hatred comes like the flood
Brother on brother on brother brothers in blood
Hate is so much easier to feel than love
Brother on brother on brothers in blood
A wave of hatred comes like the flood
Brother on brother on brother brothers in blood


Misery can be so attractive
When making yourself happy is the only alternative
At the expense of someone elses life
Do it for yourself damn it do whats right
Nothings ever perfect
This is just a test
Imagine think about living your life
Imagine think about being stabbed with a dull knife
Imagine think how sane youll be when its through
Imagine think real hard then do what you gotta do
Blood on your hands blood in my eyes
Blood I cant keep blood circumscribes
Blood on your hands blood in my eyes
Blood I cant keep blood circumscribes
Blood on your hands turns into blood in my eyes
And with the blood I cant keep our lives blood circumscribes
Blood on your hands turns into blood in my eyes
And with the blood I cant keep our lives blood circumscribes
