Breathing Lightning Lyrics

I have walked this world and back now
Too many times to count or stop, how?
Time is nothing, slow and focused
I stalk this land with just one purpose

A deal made the second that you choose to force my will
An extension of my hand with the intent to kill by the white lightning
You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap I’m breathing lightning
And this world has moved on

My body broken there’s no quit
My will intact and I can’t stop it
Hearts and minds can see the end
Until it all happens again

Like so many before you, you’ll see what death will bring
After me there’s no one else, no angels there to sing just the white
Lightning

You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap I’m breathing lightning
And this world has moved on

I look inside myself is this the right thing?
Is this the right thing, I don’t know
You might also like
Like so many before you, we’ll see what death will bring, can you hear the angels sing? Do you hear the angels sing?
Like so many before you, I’d do anything, just to hear the angels sing, just to hear the angels sing

You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap I’m breathing lightning
And this world has moved on

I look inside myself is this the right thing?
Is this the right thing, I don’t knowEmbed
