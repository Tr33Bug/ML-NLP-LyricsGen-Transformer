I have walked this world and back now
Too many times to count or stop how
Time is nothing slow and focused
I stalk this land with just one purpose
A deal made the second that you choose to force my will
An extension of my hand with the intent to kill by the white lightning
You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap Im breathing lightning
And this world has moved on
My body broken theres no quit
My will intact and I cant stop it
Hearts and minds can see the end
Until it all happens again
Like so many before you youll see what death will bring
After me theres no one else no angels there to sing just the white
Lightning
You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap Im breathing lightning
And this world has moved on
I look inside myself is this the right thing
Is this the right thing I dont know
Like so many before you well see what death will bring can you hear the angels sing Do you hear the angels sing
Like so many before you Id do anything just to hear the angels sing just to hear the angels sing
You always have the chance to do the right thing
Until the right thing comes undone
And with a thunderclap Im breathing lightning
And this world has moved on
I look inside myself is this the right thing
Is this the right thing I dont know
