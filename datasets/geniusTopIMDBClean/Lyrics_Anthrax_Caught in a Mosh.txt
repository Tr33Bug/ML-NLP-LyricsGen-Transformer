Why dont you listen when I try to talk to you
Stop thinking of yourself for just a second fool
Shut up shut up I dont wanna hear your mouth
Your mother made a monster now get the hell out of my house
Cant stand it for another day
I aint gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat my fists are clenching
Stomp stomp stomp the idiot convention
Which one of these words dont you understand
Oh caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
Dont tell me how to do my job
Theres the door your names on the knob
Youre always in the way like a beast on my back
Were you dropped as a baby Cause brain you lack
Cant stand it for another day
I aint gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat my fists are clenching
Stomp stomp stomp the idiot convention
Which one of these words dont you understand
Oh caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh


Aw 
Think before you speak
Or suffer for your words
Learn to give respect that others give to you
Oh the best you can do
Hey man 
Im trying to reason but you dont understand
Talking in circles well never get it straight
Just you and me in our theater of hate
Cant stand it for another day
I aint gonna live my life this way
Cold sweat my fists are clenching
Stomp stomp stomp the idiot convention
Which one of these words dont you understand
Oh caught in a mosh
Talking to you is like clapping with one hand
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
What is it Caught in a mosh
