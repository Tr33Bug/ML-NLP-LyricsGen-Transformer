Now you see me now you dont
Now you see me now you dont
Now you see me now you dont
Now you see me now you dont
Now you see me now you dont
Go before I am the goat
You get away with murder
Kill me when youre through
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you
You get away with murder
What do I have to do
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Wont you crush on me
Crush on me crush on me
Crush on me crush on me
Crush on me crush on me crush on
Pile your dead on top of me
Pile your dead on top of me
Pile your dead on top of me
Pile your dead on top of me
Tape my eyes so I cant see
You get away with murder
Kill me when youre through
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you
You get away with murder
What do I have to do
Do I have to give up me
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
To be loved by you
From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Wont you crush on me
Crush on me crush on me
Crush on me crush on me
Crush on me crush on me crush on
Ive been waiting for today
Wont you crush on me crush on me 
I cant touch you when youre far away
Crush on me crush on me 
Nothing makes me feel this way
Crush on me crush on me 
Except hate but that fades away
Crush on me crush on 
From the smallest taste I use
From the smallest taste I lose
Wont you crush on me
Crush on me crush on me
Crush on me crush on me
Crush on me crush on me crush on
Ive been waiting for today
Wont you crush on me crush on me 
I cant touch you when youre far away
Crush on me crush on me 
Nothing makes me feel this way
Crush on me crush on me 
Except hate but that fades away
Crush on me crush on
