Efilnikufesin  NFL  Lyrics
It started back in highschool
So cool king of the scene
You found that making people laugh
Was more than just a dream
The public took right to you
Like flies to a pile of shit
So funny and smart so talented
But success just couldnt fit
Wasting your life
No future is bright
Dancing on your grave
Living like a slave someone shouldve said
NFL Efilnikufesin
NFL
NFL Efilnikufesin
NFL
Wake up dead in a plywood bed
Six feet from the rest of your life
And when you couldnt see your own dependency
NFL nice fucking life
The whole world is your playground
Yet you couldnt find your niche
Your only friends it helps you through
Helps you dig your daily ditch
The bottom line cant touch you
Cause youre above the rest
Your little friends the enemy
And the bottom line is death
Wasting your life
No future is bright
Dancing on your grave
Living like a slave someone shouldve said


NFL Efilnikufesin
NFL
NFL Efilnikufesin
NFL
Wake up dead in a plywood bed
Six feet from the rest of your life
And when you couldnt see your own dependency
NFL nice fucking life
You lived a life of excess
Goddamn shame its such a waste
Just one too many cookies
From the batch no one should taste
Yet his memory still stays with us
Cause watching him was fun
Too bad that things werent different
Who knows what hed have done
Wasting your life
No future is bright
Dancing on your grave
Living like a slave someone shouldve said
NFL Efilnikufesin
NFL
NFL Efilnikufesin
NFL
Wake up dead in a plywood bed
Six feet from the rest of your life
And when you couldnt see your own dependency
NFL nice fucking life
