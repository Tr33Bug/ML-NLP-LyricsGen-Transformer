Life can be so wonderful
Real love this time you fool
And then you wake up
And youd chew off your own arm
Or face the only graduate from Satans school of charm
I hear your mama calling you
I hear your mama calling you
Youd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama calling you
I drink three six packs just so I can look at your face
Finally
You give respect you get respect
And you just dont know your place
Finally
You never learn you always burn
Now Ive got you off my case
Finally
I drank three six packs just so I could look at your face
Finally
See ya
Over finished gone done out
Shes not the one you married
Not the one who cared
Maybe its her evil twin that got you by the short hairs
Can you live without it
Can you be a man
Can you tell her take a walk and stick it up her can
I hear your mama calling you
I hear your mama calling you
Youd better stand and face the truth boy
I hear your mama calling you


I drink three six packs just so I can look at your face
Finally
You give respect you get respect
And you just dont know your place
Finally
You never learn you always burn
Now Ive got you off my case
Finally
I drank three six packs just so I could look at your face
Finally
See ya
Over finished gone done out
I hear your mama calling you
I hear you mama calling you
Now go and pack your bags were through
I hear you mama calling you
Rape my mind led down the wrong path
One too many rides and you crashed
Had the looks but had no class
Steal my life and taint my past
Sorry I dont mean to laugh
How long have you been waiting to be set free
Dont you know its easy as 1 2 3
Dont be a faggot now thats the key
Dont you know its easy as 1 2 3
Now Im free now Im free me me me finally
Over finished gone done out
