Wake up got another day to get
Through now got another man to see
Gotta call him on the telephone wayo
Gotta find a piece of paper
Sit down got another letter to write
Think hard gotta get a letter just right
Little ringing on the telephone whoa no
Gotta write another letter
No such thing as tomorrow all we want
One two three go
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
If I tell you what Im doing today
Will you shut up and get out of my way
Someone ask me what the time is
I dont know only know I gotta go now
No time trying to get my watch repaired
No time never got a thing to wear
Little ringing on the telephone whoa no
Hear a ringing in my head now
No such thing as tomorrow all we want
One two three go
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head


No such thing as tomorrow all we want
One two three go
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Time
Got the time tick tick ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
