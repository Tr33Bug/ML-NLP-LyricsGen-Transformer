Striking down the enemy
Fighting hand to hand
Troops are thrusting onwards
Time to take command
Ready to devour on the attack
Bodies lie dismembered
Maimed killed and hacked
Drew fast cut first
Live hard die hard
Feel the point of the blade
Lunging like an animal killing all in sight
Going for the throat living for the fight
In a bath of bloodshed
Mixing with the sweat
Crawling through the barbwire
Put it to the test
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fighting the war
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight
Ah GungHo GungHo GungHo
GungHo GungHo GungHo
Raging on the warpath
Storming through the town
Blowing it to pieces killing all around
Stand in our way if youve got the balls
In a hail of bullets youre nailed to the wall
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fighting the war
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight
Ah GungHo GungHo GungHo
GungHo GungHo GungHo


We wait out the day we burn in the sun
We move out by night and kill everyone
Show no emotions have no regrets
Made to take pain no fear of death
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fighting the war
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight
Ah GungHo GungHo GungHo
GungHo GungHo GungHo
Drew fast cut first
Live hard die hard
Feel the point of the blade
Manic laughter
