Gung-Ho Lyrics
Striking down the enemy
Fighting hand to hand
Troops are thrusting onwards
Time to take command
Ready to devour, on the attack
Bodies lie dismembered
Maimed, killed and hacked

Drew fast, cut first
Live hard, die hard
Feel the point of the blade
Lunging like an animal, killing all in sight
Going for the throat, living for the fight
In a bath of bloodshed
Mixing with the sweat
Crawling through the barbwire
Put it to the test

Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fighting the war
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Ah, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho

Raging on the warpath
Storming through the town
Blowing it to pieces, killing all around
Stand in our way if you've got the balls
In a hail of bullets, you're nailed to the wall

Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fighting the war
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Ah, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho
You might also like

We wait out the day, we burn in the sun
We move out by night and kill everyone
Show no emotions, have no regrets
Made to take pain, no fear of death

Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fighting the war
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Ah, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho

Drew fast, cut first
Live hard, die hard
Feel the point of the blade
