I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
Who what where when why
How many ways can you lie
How many ways can you try
How many ways can you die
What am I gonna do
I cant look at you
What are you gonna do
Youre no hypocrite
I bash my head
Against your wall every day
Youd bash your head
Against a wall anyway
And then youd turn to look
To see if I care
But I cant and I never did
What did you expect me to give
You never deserved my respect
How many ways can you try
It burns a hole inside your mind
What am I gonna do
I cant look at you
I cant look like you
Im no hypocrite
What are you gonna do
You love to look at you
You dont have a clue
Youre no hypocrite
Youve got a hole inside
That you have to feed
Youve got a hole
Youll use to get what you need
And then you turn to look to see if I care
See if I care
But I cant and I never did
What did you expect me to give
You never deserved my respect
How many ways can you try
It burns a hole inside your mind


What am I gonna do
I cant look at you
I cant look like you
Im no hypocrite
What are you gonna do
You love to look at you
You dont have a clue
Youre no hypocrite
It burns a hole inside my mind
It burns a hole inside my mind
Youve got that look I wanna know
Youve got that look
The Hy Pro Glo
It burns a hole inside my mind
It burns a hole inside my mind
Youve got that look I wanna know
Youve got that look
The Hy Pro Glo
It burns a hole inside my mind
It burns a hole inside my mind
I I I I I I
Who what where when why
How many ways can you lie
How many ways can you try
How many ways can you die
What am I gonna do
I cant look at you
I cant look like you
Im no hypocrite
What are you gonna do
You love to look at you
You dont have a clue
Youre no hypocrite
