Fifteen years in the academy
He was like no cadet theyd ever seen
A man so hard his veins bleed ice
When he speaks he never says it twice
They call him Judge his last name is Dredd
So break the law and youll wind up dead
Truth and justice are what hes fighting for
Judge Dredd the man he is the law
Drokk it
With his gun and bike he rules the streets
Every perp he meets will taste defeat
Not even Death will overcome his might
Dredd and Anderson they won the fight
When the Sovs started the Apocalypse war
MegaCity was bombed to the floor
Dredd resisted and the judges fought back
Crushed the Sovs with their counterattack
Drokk it
Respect the badge he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun your sentence may be death
Because
I am the law
You wont fuck around no more  I am the law 
I judge the rich I judge the poor  I am the law 
Commit a crime Ill lock the door  I am the law 
Because in MegaCity I am the law
In the Cursed Earth where mutants dwell
There is no law just a living Hell
Anarchy and chaos as the blood runs red
This would change if were up to Dredd
The Book of Law is the Bible to him
Any crime committed is a sin
He keeps peace with his lawgiver
Judge jury and executioner
Respect the badge he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun your sentence may be death
Because
I am the law
You wont fuck around no more  I am the law 
I judge the rich I judge the poor  I am the law 
Commit a crime Ill lock the door  I am the law 
Because in MegaCity I am the law
Crime the ultimate sin
Your IsoCube is waiting when he brings you in
Law its what he stands for
Crimes his only enemy and hes going to war
Oh
Crime the ultimate sin
Your IsoCube is waiting when he brings you in
Law its what he stands for
Crimes his only enemy and hes going to war
Hahahaha 
Respect the badge he earned it with his blood
Fear the gun your sentence may be death
Because
I am the law
You wont fuck around no more  I am the law 
I judge the rich I judge the poor  I am the law 
Commit a crime Ill lock the door  I am the law 
Because in MegaCity I am the law
I am the law
No fuck around no more  I am the law 
I judge the rich I judge the poor  I am the law 
Commit a crime Ill lock the door  I am the law 
Because in MegaCity
I am the law
