Whoa
Look into my holy eyes
An empty smile and youre hypnotised
Selling lies my enterprise
The sheep just get in line
Capitulate so easily
The power of fear that Im traffickin
Years of sleep have made you blind
I made the bed youre in
As I lead the child to war again  War again 
Heaven lives in every gun
Ill damn you
Im alive to be the demon
Im alive to be the one
Yeaheaheaheah
Hell it lives in everyone
When your world has slipped away
And all you have is me to pay
Once so proud you beg for more
And spread your legs like some dirty whore
As I lead the child to war again  War again 
Heaven lives in every gun
Ill damn you
Im alive to be the demon
Im alive to be the one
Yeaheaheaheah
Hell it lives in everyone
Im alive to be the demon
Im alive to be the one
Yeaheaheaheah
Hell it lives
Im invited
Im invited
One nation under
One nation under me
As I lead the child to war again
As I lead the child to war again
As I lead the child to war
Heaven lives lives in every gun
Im alive to be the demon
Im alive to be the one
Yeaheaheaheah
Hell it lives in everyone
Im alive to be the demon
Im alive to be the one
Yeaheaheaheah
Hell it lives in everyone
Im alive to be the demon
Im alive to be the one
Yeaheaheaheah
Hell it lives in everyone
