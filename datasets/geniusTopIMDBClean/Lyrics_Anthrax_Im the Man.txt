Iâ€™m the Man Lyrics
Oh-oh!
Not!,NOT!
Yeah!

Now we're Anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
And I'll steal your pop-tarts like I stole your
-- Socks!
No man, what's the matter with you?
-- I'll get it the next time, I mean it...
Charlie...
Beat the beats the beats you beat
The only thing hard is the smell of my feet (P-U!)
So listen up 'cause you might get dissed
Go drain your lizard or take a
-- Chair!
Damn...watch the beat!

I'm on your case, I'm in your face
I kick you and your father back in place
Step off sucker understand
Don't you know I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm so bad I should be in detention
Shu-shu-shut up

We've got real def rhythms and fresh new jams
And ya think we got egos but we're just hams
Scott plays stickball and likes to skate
Frank is never on time he's always...
-- Sleeping!
"Late!"

They drink the drinks, the drinks they drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack, they offer us joints
We don't do drugs, do you get our...
-- Meaning!
"Point!" (Not!) "Point!" (Not!) Watch the beat!
You might also like
I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step off sucker, understand
Don't you know
I'm the man! I'm the man!
I'm bad! I'm so bad I should be in detention!
I'm the man!
Shut up!

For a heavy metal band rap's a different way
We like to be different and not cliche
They say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our...
-- Sexual organ located in the lower abdominal area!
No man, it's "dick!" --Oh-oh!
MASTER!

Danny, Fart the farts, the farts he farted
I pick my nose but I'm not retarted
Like El Duce says "smell my anal vapor"
And wipe my butt with your...
-- Face!
"Toilet paper!" Yo, watch the beat!
(Yeah!)

I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step up sucker, understand
Don't you know
I'm the man! I'm the man!
I'm bad! I'm so bad I should be in detention!
I'm the man!
Shut up!

So, as this rap is winding down
It's plain to see we wear the crown
You know Anthrax is number one
But we don't care, we just wanna have...
-- A festival!
"Fun" you stupid idiot!
Joey mailed the mail the mail he mails
We are the kings and all shall hail
We're like a diamond that is forever
And we'll remain the hardest ever

(Shut up!)
I'm so bad, it's a crime
Head check
Oh-oh!
Not
(Not! Not! Not! Not! Not!)1Embed
