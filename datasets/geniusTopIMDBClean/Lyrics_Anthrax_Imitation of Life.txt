Theres nothing I hate more than all these plastic people
With all their plastic promises and all their plastic deals
They just cant be themselves and live their own lives out
Theyre just an imitation of what lifes all about
Because of me you are who you are
So sign your name and youll go far
Im your friend I think you should
So sign your name its for your own good
How many times have you heard this today
Some bogus pisson saying Lets do lunch babe
For them this bullshit its their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife  Imitation of life 
Oh oh oh
Anger burns
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change I still call him friend
Take my advice and listen to me
A great opportunity cant you see
I only want whats best for you
The deal of a lifetime what more can I do
How many times have you heard this today
Some stupid sucker says Its great we luv ya babe
For them this bullshit its their whole life
Cut through their bullshit with a knife  Imitation of life 
Oh oh oh
Anger burns
Bands dress like women with hairspray and lace
Id pass an image law stick it in their face
Lets see how long they keep dressing this way
Wearing this image twenty four hours a day


Did you ever think for yourself
Just once did you ever think
Thats all I want to know
Imitation of life living out a lie
Youll never be right imitation of life
Why are you here
Youre taking up my space
The new imperfect race imitation of life
Oh oh oh
Anger burns
Whatever happened to the guy I knew
A media creation a monster grew
Our story had an unhappy end
But this could change I still call him friend
Theres nothing I hate more than all these plastic people
And all their plastic promises and all their plastic deals
They just cant be themselves and live their own lives out
Theyre just an imitation of what lifes all about
Imitation of life
