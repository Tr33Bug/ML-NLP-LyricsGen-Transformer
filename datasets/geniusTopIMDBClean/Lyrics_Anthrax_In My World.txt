They gonna put me in jail
Man Im already in jail
Dont they know that my life
Is just one big cell
Ill bite the hand that feeds me
And I could give a damn
If that hand needs me
Oh why cant you leave me alone
A lie may fool someone else
But it tells you the truth
Youre weak just another clone
I just want my life to do whatever I like
Yeah its a selfish need
To have no responsibility
So Ill say what Im gonna say
Cause Im going to Hell anyway
Id rather be alone
In my world
Im not afraid Im not afraid
Nothing touches me
Im a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh  Laugh laugh 
In my world its cold
My defense is like stone
No one gets inside cause
In my world Im home
In my world I loathe
And youll always pay a toll
No one gets inside cause
In my world Im home yeah


An adult at thirteen
My childhood was a dream
A full clout nightmare a sight unseen
My greatest fear as a kid
One which I always kept hid
Was to come home from school and
Find my mother dead
I just want my life to do whatever I like
Yeah its a selfish need
To have no responsibility
So Ill say what Im gonna say
Cause Im going to Hell anyway
Id rather be alone
In my world
Im not afraid Im not afraid
Nothing touches me
Im a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh  Laugh laugh 
In my world its cold
My defense is like stone
No one gets inside cause
In my world Im home
In my world I loathe
And youll always pay a toll
No one gets inside cause
In my world Im home
Whooooaaaaah
Im not afraid Im not afraid
Nothing touches me
Im a walking razor blade
Face the face of fear
Face the face of death
Laugh when others tear
Hate when others laugh
Im not afraid Im not afraid
Nothing touches me
Im a walking razor blade
Im not afraid Im not afraid
Im not afraid Im not afraid
Im not afraid
