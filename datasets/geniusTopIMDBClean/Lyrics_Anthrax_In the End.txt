Lone star was dark tonight
Our diamond shined so bright
I watched it go further than he ever dreamed
I cant take it
No matter how I try I cant stop asking why
Cause somethings broken
Scarred and it breaks my heart
I wont take it cant break it
In the end Im pounding on the door
But its already over
Too little too late
In the end youll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me
And when the greatest falls Heaven and Hell will call
Stand up and fight
On and on this memory screams
I cant take it
Stand up and fight withal
I wont take it cant break it
In the end Im pounding on the door
But its already over
Too little too late
In the end youll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
In the end Im kicking down the door
And Im taking this over
Im cleaning the slate
In the end youll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me
Did I thank you for our time together
Did I thank you for making me better
Did I thank you for being the one I would bleed and kill for
Did I thank you for tearing my head off
Ripping my heart out
Fucking my world
Did we tell you how much that we loved you
Did we tell you you made our dreams come true
Did we tell you that you were the one
Paving our way the damage is done
Did we thank you for tearing our heads off
Ripping our hearts out
Fucking our world

I cant break it down
In the end Im pounding on the door
But its already over
Too little too late
In the end youll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
In the end Im kicking down the door
And Im taking this over
Im cleaning the slate
In the end youll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me
