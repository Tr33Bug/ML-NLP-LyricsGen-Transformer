Indians Lyrics
We all see in black and white
When it comes to someone else's fight
No one ever gets involved
Apathy can never solve

Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
We're dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation
Respect is something that you earn
Our Indian brothers' getting burned
Original American
Turned into a second class citizen

Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
We're dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation

Cry for the Indians, oh
Die for the Indians
Cry for the Indians
Oh, cry, cry, cry for the Indians

Love the land and fellow man
Peace is what we strive to have
Some folks have none of this
Hatred and prejudice
You might also like
Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
We're dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation

Cry for the Indians
Die for the Indians
Cry for the Indians
Cry, cry, cry for the Indians

War dance
Territory it's just the body of the nation
The people that inhabit it make its configuration
Prejudice, something we all can do without
A flag of many colors is what this land's all about


We all see in black and white
When it comes to someone else's fight
No one ever gets involved, no one
Apathy can never solve
Forced out, brave and mighty
Stolen land, they can't fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
We're dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation

Cry for the Indians
Die for the Indians
Cry for the Indians
Cry, cry, cry for the Indians4Embed
