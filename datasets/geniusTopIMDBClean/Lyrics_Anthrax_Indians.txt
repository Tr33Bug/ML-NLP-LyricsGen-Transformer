We all see in black and white
When it comes to someone elses fight
No one ever gets involved
Apathy can never solve
Forced out brave and mighty
Stolen land they cant fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
Were dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation
Respect is something that you earn
Our Indian brothers getting burned
Original American
Turned into a second class citizen
Forced out brave and mighty
Stolen land they cant fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
Were dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation
Cry for the Indians oh
Die for the Indians
Cry for the Indians
Oh cry cry cry for the Indians
Love the land and fellow man
Peace is what we strive to have
Some folks have none of this
Hatred and prejudice


Forced out brave and mighty
Stolen land they cant fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
Were dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation
Cry for the Indians
Die for the Indians
Cry for the Indians
Cry cry cry for the Indians
War dance
Territory its just the body of the nation
The people that inhabit it make its configuration
Prejudice something we all can do without
A flag of many colors is what this lands all about
We all see in black and white
When it comes to someone elses fight
No one ever gets involved no one
Apathy can never solve
Forced out brave and mighty
Stolen land they cant fight it
Hold on to pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missing
Were dissing them
On reservations
A hopeless situation
Cry for the Indians
Die for the Indians
Cry for the Indians
Cry cry cry for the Indians
