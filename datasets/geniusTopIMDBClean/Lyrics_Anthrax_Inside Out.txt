I thought I knew what provocation was
Ive eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason
Its in my stomach like fire like cancer
And like a knife Ive been gunshot

Gotta let it go gotta let it go gotta let it go yeah
Its in my stomach like fire
In my stomach like cancer
In my stomach like a knife Ive been gunshot
Goddamn nowhere place to be
Dying deep inside of me
Always standing on the inside looking out
Cant break a heart so strong with pride
Its more than just being alive
I broke the rule with you Im out
My only antidote to mental suffering
Is physical pain
Ive eaten from the insane root that imprisons reason
