Judas Priest Lyrics
Making my time on the line
Filthy with the knowledge I'm
Planting seeds, spreading disease
Rip away, tear up the beams
Ravaged, it's all so damaged
You're locked in, disinter the ancient ways
Death to all that dare to pray
Ravaged, never as savage
And that's the price you pay, open the door
Find the monster, start the war
I'm bound to, bow down to

I am become Death, destroyer of worlds
A menial place in this infinite swirl
Your pitiful lives and none more the wise
The human condition is dropping like flies
Unleashed is the beast, the worst of the least
From sheer depraved evil like Judas Priest
Having his way, my canvas unfurled
I am become Death, destroyer of worlds

Reign, reign
The ending of yours has begun
The ending of yours has begun
Who will stand with me in victory?

Huh, chose to trust me, better still
You gave your eyes your own free will
Invulnerable, your bold conceit
I'm leaving you stunned in defeat
Ravaged, so bloody ravaged
You take this brutal beating at my hands
Uncivilized, my victory stands
Ravaged, never as savage
And that's the price you pay, open the door
Find the monster, start the war
You might also like
I'm bound to, bow down to

I am become Death, destroyer of worlds
A menial place in this infinite swirl
Your pitiful lives and none more the wise
The human condition is dropping like flies
Unleashed is the beast, the worst of the least
From sheer depraved evil like Judas Priest
Having his way, my canvas unfurled
I am become Death, destroyer of worlds

Reign, reign
The ending of yours has begun
The ending of yours has begun
Who will stand with me in victory?

Screaming, rapid fire, genocide
Screaming, saints in Hell are running wild
Rage, the prelude has begun
Now your epitaph is sung
Pounding, monolithic fists of stone
Pounding, on the sinner to atone
Rage, the prelude has begun
Now your epitaph is sung
I am become Death, destroyer of worlds
A menial place in this infinite swirl
Your pitiful lives and none more the wise
The human condition is dropping like flies
Unleashed is the beast, the worst of the least
From sheer depraved evil like Judas Priest
Having his way, my canvas unfurled
I am become Death, destroyer of worlds

Reign, reign
The ending of yours has begun
The ending of yours has begun
Reign, reign
If you look for a monster, you'll find one
The ending for all has begunEmbed
