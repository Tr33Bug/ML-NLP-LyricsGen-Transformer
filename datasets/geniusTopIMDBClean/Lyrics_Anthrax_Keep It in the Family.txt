Mankind
The public enemys not the man who speaks his mind
The public enemys the man that goes and acts blind
Searching for an answer that hell never find
An action from reaction and you cant make a retraction
Once youve put your head out
And then youre blue in the face as you try to state your case
You can think with your dick but it cant shout
Yo I try to understand what the Hell is going on
I cant imagine how things ever got so far gone
You separatists say you want your own state
Ill give them a state a state of unconsciousness
Retribution no solution constitution
Discrimination through the nation
Raining hatred
I yell
When theres schism you must rebel
I yell so youll hear
I yell I refuse to live in your Hell
I am what you fear
Im the truth
I dont keep it in the family
Live your life take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real worlds outside your door
You cant keep it in the family
Youve got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the keep it in the
Keep it in the family
Dont even try to tell me what you think is right
When to you blacks are niggers and Jews are kikes
And you expect to be taken seriously
But your actions theyre more than curiously juvenile
You emulate what you hate
And you dont even know why you feel this way
Cause daddy hated this and mommy hated that
And your own ability to reasons like a tire gone flat
Yo I try to understand what the Hell is going on
I cant imagine how things ever got so far gone
You separatists say you want your own state
Ill give them a state a state of unconsciousness
Retribution no solution constitution
Discrimination through the nation
Raining hatred
I yell
When theres schism you must rebel
I yell so youll hear
I yell I refuse to live in your Hell
I am what you fear
Im the truth
I dont keep it in the family
Live your life take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real worlds outside your door
You cant keep it in the family
Youve got the longest way to fall
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the family
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the
When you keep it in the family
Acting out of pure cold hatred
Cause of what anothers race is
Color of anothers face is
Different and your own frustrations
Taking on a violent nature
Full of hate so full of hate
Youd kill a man is that your fate
Your street becomes a police state
Why the Hell do you hate
Hate  One  hate  Two  hate  Three  hate  Four  hate  Five 
Hate  Six  hate  Seven  hate  Eight  hate  Nine 
Im not gonna stand for it
Someones gonna pay for it
I yell we rebel
Were the truth and
We dont keep it in the family
Live your life take someone else
Keep it in the family
The real worlds outside your door
You cant keep it in the family
Youve got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the family
Im the thing that you most fear
I dont keep it in the family
Im the truth you wont hear
Keep it in the family
The real worlds outside your door
You cant keep it in the family
Youve got the longest way to fall
Keep it in the family
Keep it in the family
Keep it in the family
Keep it in the family
