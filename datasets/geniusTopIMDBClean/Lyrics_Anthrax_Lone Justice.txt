Aw
Theres two kinds of people in this world
The outlaws and the lawmen that prevail
The bounty hunters job is on the wrong side of the law
Intentions of the truth and nothing more
Burn them clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless ones gonna have some fun
Hes gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted its over quick hes nailed them three for three
Then with his squinteyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history
The jury in his mind his choices weigh
The trials if youre guilty youre his prey
No judgement otherwise can change the lust thats in his eyes
The sentence will be carried out in stride
Burn them clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless ones gonna have some fun
Hes gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted its over quick hes nailed them three for three
Then with his squinteyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history
No name like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game hell be there to uphold
Justice law and order
And youll pay the highest fee yeah
When the gunslinger takes his piece ohwhoa yeah
The money its the price you have to pay
When he calls drop your eyes and look away
The man has taken life to balance scales of wrong and right
Existence each day a moral fight


Burn them clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless ones gonna have some fun
Hes gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted Its over quick hes nailed them three for three
Then with his squinteyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history
No name like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game hell be there to uphold
Justice law and order
And youll pay the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
Oh the gunslinger
No name like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game hell be there to uphold
Justice law and order
And youll pay the highest fee oh
No name like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game hell be there to uphold
Justice law and order
And youll pay the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
Oh the gunslinger
