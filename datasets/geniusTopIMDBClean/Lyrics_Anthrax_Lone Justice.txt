Lone Justice Lyrics
Aw!

There's two kinds of people in this world
The outlaws and the lawmen that prevail
The bounty hunter's job is on the wrong side of the law
Intentions of the truth and nothing more

Burn them, clear the streets as he rides into the town
'Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun
He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted, it's over quick, he's nailed them three for three
Then with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history
The jury, in his mind his choices weigh
The trials, if you're guilty, you're his prey
No judgement otherwise can change the lust that's in his eyes
The sentence will be carried out in stride

Burn them, clear the streets as he rides into the town
'Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun
He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted, it's over quick, he's nailed them three for three
Then with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history

No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay the highest fee, yeah

When the gunslinger takes his piece, oh-whoa, yeah

The money, it's the price you have to pay
When he calls, drop your eyes and look away
The man has taken life to balance scales of wrong and right
Existence, each day a moral fight
You might also like
Burn them, clear the streets as he rides into the town
Cause the nameless one's gonna have some fun
He's gonna bring an outlaw down
Wasted, It's over quick, he's nailed them three for three
Then with his squint-eyed grin and stubbled chin
He rides through history

No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay the highest fee

When the gunslinger takes his piece
Oh, the gunslinger


No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay the highest fee, oh
No name, like a shadow on a moonless night
Real game, he'll be there to uphold
Justice, law and order
And you'll pay the highest fee
When the gunslinger takes his piece
Oh, the gunslingerEmbed
