Its time for your medication Mr Brown
Muhahahahahahahahaha
Oh white coats to bind me out of control
I live alone inside my mind
World of confusion air filled with noise
Who says that my lifes such a crime
Trapped in this nightmare I wish Id wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls surround me an empty gaze
I cant find my way outta this maze
And I dont care fall in fall out
Gone without a doubt  Help me 
I cant take the blame
They dont feel the shame
Its a madhouse
Or so they claim
Its a madhouse
Oh am I insane
My fears behind me what can I do
My dreams haunt my sleep at night oh no
Wont learn their lesson white fills my eyes
And only then they see the light
Trapped in this nightmare I wish Id wake
And my whole life begins to shake
Four walls surround me an empty gaze
I cant find my way outta this maze
Cause I dont care fall in fall out
Gone without a doubt  Help me 
Cant take the blame
I dont feel the shame
Cause its a madhouse
Or so they claim
Its a madhouse
Im insane
Trapped in this nightmare I wish Id wake
As my whole life begins to shake
Four walls surround me an empty gaze
Cant find my way outta this maze
Cause I dont care fall in fall out
Gone without a doubt  Help me 
Cant take the blame
You dont feel the shame
Its a madhouse
Or so they claim
Its a madhouse
Im insane
Mad madhouse  Mad 
Mad mad mad madhouse
