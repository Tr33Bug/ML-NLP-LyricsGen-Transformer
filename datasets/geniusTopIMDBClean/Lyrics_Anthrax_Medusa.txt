Ohwoahoh
Ohwoah
Endless curse blood runs cold
Evil stares will turn your flesh to stone
Land of doom world of sin all subside
Dont venture near the island where she lives
Oh shell suck you in
Destroyer of life Demon
Oh Im ready to strike Gorgon
Serpents bride the end awaits human prey
No swords or armor shield you from your fate
Hey you you cant escape
Wicked smile full of lies head of snakes
Approach her cave but dont look in her eyes
Oh her eyes
Destroyer of life Demon
Oh Im ready to strike Gorgon
Seize appease deceive die
Seize appease deceive die
Medusa shes staring at you
Medusa with her eyes
Medusa
Evil witch cast her spell seducing you
Shell take you to the very depths of hell
Oh no no  Oh 
Cannot move no eyes to see a statue now
For all eternity Medusa laughs at you ha ha
And youre her slave


Destroyer of life Demon
Oh Im ready to strike Gorgon
Seize appease deceive die
Seize appease deceive die
Medusa shes staring at you
Medusa with her eyes
Medusa oh shes cold
Medusa
Endless curse blood runs cold
Evil stares will turn your flesh to stone  Stone 
Land of doom world of sin all subside
Dont venture near the island where she lives
Oh shell suck you in
Destroyer of life Demon
Oh Im ready to strike Gorgon
Oh Medusa shes staring at you
Medusa with her eyes
Medusa oh
Medusa oh shes cold
Staring
