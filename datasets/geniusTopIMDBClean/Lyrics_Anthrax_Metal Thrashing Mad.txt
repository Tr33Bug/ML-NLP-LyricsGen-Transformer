Metal Thrashing Mad Lyrics
Woah-yeah!

Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
I'm the madman at the wheel

Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
I'm metal thrashing mad, yeah!
Metal thrashing mad, yeah!
Driving like a maniac
I can't go any faster
I'm burning up the road
And headed for disaster

Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
I'm metal thrashing mad
Whoa-yeah!


Woah-yeah!

Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
I'm the madman at the wheel

Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
I'm metal thrashing mad
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
I'm metal thrashing madYou might also like1Embed
