Woahyeah
Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
Im the madman at the wheel
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
Im metal thrashing mad yeah
Metal thrashing mad yeah
Driving like a maniac
I cant go any faster
Im burning up the road
And headed for disaster
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
Im metal thrashing mad
Whoayeah
Woahyeah
Racing down the road
In a street machine of steel
Gears are jammed in full
Im the madman at the wheel
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
Im metal thrashing mad
Got my foot pinned to the floor
You can feel the engine roar
I got thunder in my head
Im metal thrashing mad
