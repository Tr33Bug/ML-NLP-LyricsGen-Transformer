Monster at the End Lyrics
Do you think that you're worth anything?
Do you think that you had everything?
Or was it just another dream
With a monster at the end?
Promised you'd get what you want
But instead, you're getting what you need
This ain't just another dream
With a monster at the end
Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end

The wall of sleep is crumbling
And your conscience is left fumbling
A massive sleeping serpent
Uncoiled and awake
In this place, this sun-bleached hell
Your sins were yours no angel fell
A monster hiding in plain sight
It's the monster at the end

Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end

It's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming
The monster is unleashed
You might also like
Now that crown is on your head
Now that crown is on your head
Now that crown is on your head
You're that monster at the end
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming

Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end
It's coming, it's coming

Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end

It's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming
It's comingEmbed
