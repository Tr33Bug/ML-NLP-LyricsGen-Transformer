Do you think that youre worth anything
Do you think that you had everything
Or was it just another dream
With a monster at the end
Promised youd get what you want
But instead youre getting what you need
This aint just another dream
With a monster at the end
Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end
The wall of sleep is crumbling
And your conscience is left fumbling
A massive sleeping serpent
Uncoiled and awake
In this place this sunbleached hell
Your sins were yours no angel fell
A monster hiding in plain sight
Its the monster at the end
Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end
Its coming its coming its coming its coming
The monster is unleashed
Now that crown is on your head
Now that crown is on your head
Now that crown is on your head
Youre that monster at the end
Its coming its coming its coming its coming
Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end
Its coming its coming
Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted
Crown the monster at the end
Its coming its coming its coming its coming
Its coming
