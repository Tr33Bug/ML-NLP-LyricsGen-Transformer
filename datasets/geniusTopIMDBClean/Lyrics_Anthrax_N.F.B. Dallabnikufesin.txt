NFB  Dallabnikufesin  Lyrics
We fell in love at first sight
I cant explain the feelings
When I first saw you
We were so so happy
A lifetime of love sweet honey child
Youll always be mine
But then I played the fool
I never meant to hurt you
Or sleep with all your friends oh
We reconciled we found ourselves
Our love was meant to be
Oh baby cant you see oh
Oh you left me standing in the mud
Crying to myself
A heart so full of pain
But we fell in love again
This time forever
True love prevails over all
She got hit by a truck
Boohoo  Joey Joey get me some tissue
