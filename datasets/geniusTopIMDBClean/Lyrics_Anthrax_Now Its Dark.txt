In dreams I can rule your life
With me nothings ever right
Sing for me up on a stage
Keep your mind trapped in a cage
Im your man Im what you need
Dance with me but never lead
One deep breath will set me free
Dont you fucking look at me
You know that I am
One fucking welldressed man
Now its dark but I can see
Dont you fucking look at me
Now its dark youre gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now its dark Mommy
Dont you fucking look at me
A sensation of elation intoxication
Now its dark
A candycoated existence
Underneath is decadence
What was hidden you have found
Made it your own battleground
Pretty pretty dont say please
Dont you fucking look at me
You know that I am
One fucking welldressed man
Now its dark but I can see
Dont you fucking look at me
Now its dark youre gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now its dark Mommy
Dont you fucking look at me
A sensation of elation intoxication
Now its dark


Ow
Listen
Ill send you a love letter
Straight from the bottom of my heart
And youll be fucked forever
The candycoated clown has done his part
Im your man Im what you need
Dance with me but never lead
One deep breath will set me free
Dont you fucking look at me
You know that I am
One fucking welldressed man
Now its dark but I can see
Dont you fucking look at me
Now its dark youre gonna be
Exactly what I want to see
Now its dark Mommy
Dont you fucking look at me
A sensation of elation intoxication
Now its dark
Now its dark
Ow
Now its dark
