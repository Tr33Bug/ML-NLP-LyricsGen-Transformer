Stop it
Theres been too much debate
We could save ourselves from holocaust
Or is that just our fate
Start now
But we continue to balk
We let the genie out of the bottle
But we still hold the cork
One two not
Three four die
One two not
Three four die
Ignorance is no excuse
For violence
No one wins
One World
One World
One World welcome to it
One World dont abuse it
One World to live out your life
One World total schism
Tunnel vision
One World taming the beast
Fighting for peace
Killing
You pushed a button thats all you did
Its much harder to kill a man
If youve seen pictures of his kids
Responsibility
And what are all our lives worth
What kind of sentence would you serve
For killing the earth


One two not
Three four die
One two not
Three four die
Ignorance is no excuse
For violence
No one wins
One World
One World
One World welcome to it
One World dont abuse it
One World to live out your life
One World total schism
Tunnel vision
One World taming the beast
Fighting for peace
Go
One World
One World
One World welcome to it
One World dont abuse it
One World to live out your life
One World total schism
Tunnel vision
One World taming the beast
Fighting for peace
Russians
Theyre only people like us
Do you really think theyd blow up the World
Dont they love their lives less
America
Stop singing hail to the chief
Instead of thinking SDI
He should be thinking of peace
One two not
Three four die
One two not
Three four die
Ignorance is no excuse
For violence
No one wins
One World
One World
One World welcome to it
One World dont abuse it
One World to live out your life
One World total schism
Tunnel vision
One World taming the beast
Fighting for peace
One World
