Only Lyrics
Everything is perfect
Everything is sick, and that's it
You can't tell me to stop it
You can't tell me not to quit, and that's it

Revolve around yourself
It's you and no-one else
Hard for me to stay
Swinging moods that change
Calmness to deranged
Unpredictable, unpredictable
You would see if
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand

Clashing ways to live here
Compromise for me, yeah
I'm at both ends of the spectrum
You're somewhere in the between
Ah, come clean

Revolve around yourself
It's you and no-one else
Hard for me to stay
Swinging moods that change
Calmness to deranged
Unpredictable, unpredictable

You would see if
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
You might also like

Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Only
You hadn't taken things out of my hands (out of my hands)
Only
You never wanted to understand

Crucified (Only)
Terrified (You hadn't taken things)
Sacrifice (Out of my hands)
My whole life, my whole life (Only)
My whole life (You never wanted)
My whole life (To understand)
My whole life

If only, if only
If only, if only
I can't contain myself
I can't contain myself
I just can't take myselfEmbed
