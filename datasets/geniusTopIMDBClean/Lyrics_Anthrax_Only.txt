Everything is perfect
Everything is sick and thats it
You cant tell me to stop it
You cant tell me not to quit and thats it
Revolve around yourself
Its you and noone else
Hard for me to stay
Swinging moods that change
Calmness to deranged
Unpredictable unpredictable
You would see if
Only
You hadnt taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Clashing ways to live here
Compromise for me yeah
Im at both ends of the spectrum
Youre somewhere in the between
Ah come clean
Revolve around yourself
Its you and noone else
Hard for me to stay
Swinging moods that change
Calmness to deranged
Unpredictable unpredictable
You would see if
Only
You hadnt taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand


Only
You hadnt taken things out of my hands
Only
You never wanted to understand
Only
You hadnt taken things out of my hands  out of my hands 
Only
You never wanted to understand
Crucified  Only 
Terrified  You hadnt taken things 
Sacrifice  Out of my hands 
My whole life my whole life  Only 
My whole life  You never wanted 
My whole life  To understand 
My whole life
If only if only
If only if only
I cant contain myself
I cant contain myself
I just cant take myself
