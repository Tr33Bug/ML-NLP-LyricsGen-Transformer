Youve got nothing to say
We cant hear you anyway
Youre unconscious wake up
Smell the coffee catch the next bus
You dont hear it not there
Havent seen it anywhere
Ignorance is bliss
Before you did we exist
Dont even think about anything
Dont even think about anything
Tell me something I dont know
Howd you get this job you own
I think that
All you need is a all you need is a
All you need is a all you need is a face
Out of sight out of mind
It was yours but now its mine
Take a riff take a line
Out of sight out of mind
Dont even think about anything
Out of sight out of mind
You cant see but youre not blind
Whats your purpose in life
What the hell gives you the right to
Take whats been done before
Change the name and make it yours oh
Yes you made your statement
Do you have to be so blatant
Youre so conscious image
With a gun youd do no damage
Dont even think about anything
Dont even think about anything
Tell me something I dont know
Howd you get this job you own
I think that
All you need is a all you need is a
All you need is a all you need is a face
Out of sight out of mind
It was yours but now its mine
Take a riff take of line
Out of sight out of mind
Dont even think about anything
Out of sight out of mind
You cant see but youre not blind
Stupid dumb idiot moron you really make
Me sick
Take your head out from up your ass
Right here right now but it wont last
No it wont
Out of sight out of mind
It was yours but now its mine
Take a riff take a line
Out of sight out of mind
Stupid dumb idiot moron
Out of sight out of mind
You cant see but youre not blind
Out of sight out of mind
It was yours but now its mine
Take a riff take a line
Out of sight out of mind
Stupid dumb idiot moron
Out of sight out of mind
You cant see but youre not blind
