This is a journey into sound
I was told to love you
I was told to try
I was born to save you
I was born to die
Ill always be your scapegoat
Youll never take the blame
You never had a chance
It was your soul to save
I am your onenight nightmare
Pain is all you see
The blood is on your hands
I hope youre proud of me
I was told to love you
I learned how to hate
I was born to save you
Your choice became your fate
You cant take care of yourself
How could you care for me
I am your retribution
When is my soul free
I never asked for mercy
You told me to forgive
The blood is on your hands
I hope youre proud of me
And what Ive done to set you free
I can barely hold myself
Fascination stimulation
Stronger as I learn
By his hand I understand
I was told to burn
Bastard son your saving grace
Left alone I found my place
I find love in what I steal
You should have let me rest
In Potters field
I was told to I was told to
Your beliefs turned me into this
Bite the hand that feeds
Youre so selfish
Thank you mother
For giving me this life
Ill bring down the rapture
Then well see who lies
Fascination stimulation
Stronger as I learn
By his hand I understand
I was told to burn
Bastard son your saving grace
Left alone I found my place
I find love in what I steal
You should have let me rest
In Potters field
I was told to I was told to
I was told to I was told to
Stop it
