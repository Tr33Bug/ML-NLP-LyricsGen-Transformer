Ive been a man of brutal means
Dealing out my business its so obscene
Im not crossed just recognised
As the son of a bitch that put it right between your eyes
An unexploded ordinance
Variate the deviance
A Glasgow kiss or a Molotov
Im about to blow it all up
Countless broken by the horror
A heros end is still the end
My kind wont be seen again
Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
Its a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
Im ready ready to begin  You bastard 
So let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil that you know
What goes around comes around
And what comes around is gonna get beat down
I dont let anything go to waste
After the cold reveal of my murder face
Another right that I made wrong
Another place I dont belong
Of all the things I said that stick
Nothing good can ever come of this
Countless broken by the horror
A heros end is still the end
My kind wont be seen again
And if you dont know now you know
Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
Its a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
Im ready ready to begin  You bastard 
So let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil that you know
Its just the devil in me
Theres no hypocrisy
What you see is what you see
What you get is what you get
Its just the devil in me
Theres no hypocrisy
What you see is what you see
What you get is what you get
Let the right one in
Its a goddamn sin
Im ready ready to begin
Let the right one in
Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
Its a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
Im ready ready to begin  You bastard 
So let the right one in
You gotta go you gotta go
Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
Its a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
Im ready Im ready  you bastard 
So let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil that you know
