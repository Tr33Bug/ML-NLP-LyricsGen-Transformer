The Devil You Know Lyrics
I've been a man of brutal means
Dealing out my business, itâ€™s so obscene
I'm not crossed, just recognised
As the son of a bitch that put it right between your eyes
An unexploded ordinance
Variate the deviance
A Glasgow kiss or a Molotov
I'm about to blow it all up

Countless, broken by the horror
A hero's end is still the end
My kind won't be seen again
Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, ready to begin (You bastard)
So let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil that you know

What goes around comes around
And what comes around is gonna get beat down
I don't let anything go to waste
After the cold reveal of my murder face
Another right that I made wrong
Another place I don't belong
Of all the things I said that stick
Nothing good can ever come of this

Countless, broken by the horror
A hero's end is still the end
My kind won't be seen again
And if you don't know, now you know

Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, ready to begin (You bastard)
So let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil that you know
You might also like
It's just the devil in me
There's no hypocrisy
What you see is what you see
What you get is what you get
It's just the devil in me
There's no hypocrisy
What you see is what you see
What you get is what you get

Let the right one in
It's a goddamn sin
I'm ready, ready to begin
Let the right one in

Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, ready to begin (You bastard)
So let the right one in
You gotta go, you gotta go
Let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil you know
It's a goddamn sin
You gotta go with the devil you know
I'm ready, I'm ready (you bastard)
So let the right one in
You gotta go with the devil that you know1Embed
