Oh ohohoh oh ooh
The plans of the race gone mad
A final solution to pass
All dreams are taken from their lives
No hope for the young all the old realize
He is but a solitary man
Whose prejudice will spread
Like a flame throughout the land
Hes enslaving those who will be free
Etching his own name in black
For all of us to hear and see
A yellow star for those accused
Theres no escape once youve been pinned
A relocation only to confuse
And all their propaganda to hide the awful truth
He is but a solitary man
Whose prejudice will spread
Like a flame throughout the land
Hes enslaving those who will be free
Etching his own name in black
For all of us to hear and see
Screams in the night
Scars so deep that they wont mend
Screams in the night oh ohohoh ohohoh
Screams in the night
In their souls they cant pretend
Screams in the night oh ohohoh ohohoh oh
Oohoh
Six million lives on the hands of heads of state
They followed orders from above
Then one man when all was lost
He took his life hell never pay the price


He is but a solitary man
Whose prejudice will spread
Like a flame throughout the land
Hes enslaving those who will be free
Etching his own name in black
For all of us to hear and see
Screams in the night
Scars so deep that they wont mend
Screams in the night oh ohohoh ohohoh
Screams in the night
In their souls they cant pretend
Screams in the night
Oh Ooh
They cannot hide or defend or disguise
For the truth is well known therell be no alibis
Judgement will pass and their fates wont be kind
For the final solution was mass genocide
Screams in the night
Scars so deep that they wont mend
Screams in the night oh ohohoh ohohoh
Screams in the night
In their souls they cant pretend
Screams in the night oh ohohoh ohohoh
Screams in the night
Scars so deep that they wont mend
Screams in the night oh ohohoh ohohoh
Screams in the night
In their souls they cant pretend
Screams in the night oh ohohoh ohohoh
Screams in the night
