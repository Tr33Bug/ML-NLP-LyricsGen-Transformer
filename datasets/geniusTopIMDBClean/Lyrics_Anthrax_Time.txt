I got so much trouble on my mind
Paranoia time Im running out of life
Clockwise and the seconds tick away
Each line that cuts my face
Cut as each hand moves into place
Paranoia amped and wired
Bile black
The thoughts that run my head
Theres so much to be said
Theyre so much living dead
Walking corpses shambling through life
With nothing in their sight
Dance on their bones
Step in and fight
Paranoia amped and wired
Life and death are fighting for my time
I cant seem to find the time
I want whats mine
Time through the clock
Just keeps talking
It just walks any damn place
Ohh it feels like walking
My mind keeps thinking
Clockwise as the seconds tick away
I make my move today
Time and life life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isnt mine it isnt yours
Man to man Ill fight you for
Time and life life and time
One day Ill get whats mine
Through persistence of time
Huh
Life and death as words
They dont mean shit
Its what you do with them
And how you live with it
Raging like a bull inside a cage
Just give me a stage
Where this bull can rage
Paranoia amped and wired
Life and death are fighting for my time
I cant seem to find the time
I want whats mine
Time through the clock
Just keeps talking
It just walks any damn place
Oh it feels like walking
My mind keeps thinking
Clockwise as the seconds tick away
I make my move today
Time and life life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isnt mine it isnt yours
Man to man Ill fight you for
Time and life life and time
One day Ill get whats mine
Through persistence of time
Go
Paranoias lost its hold on
Paranoias lost its hold on
Paranoias lost its hold on
Paranoias got no hold on me
Time dont have nothing
To do with how high you can
Time dont got nothing
To do with how high you can count
Time and life life and time
To have and hold
And sometimes find
It isnt mine it isnt yours
Man to man Ill fight you for
Time and life life and time
One day Ill get whats mine
Through persistence of time
