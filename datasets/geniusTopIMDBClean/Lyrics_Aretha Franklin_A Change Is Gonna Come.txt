Theres an old friend that
I once heard say
Something that touched my heart
And it began this way
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
Ive been running ever since
He said its been a long time coming
But I know my change is gonna come oh yeah
He said its been too hard livin
But Im afraid to die
I might not be if I knew what was up there
Beyond the sky
Its been a long long time coming
But I know my change is got to come oh yeah
I went I went to my brother
And I asked him Brother
Could you help me please
He said Good sister
Id like to but Im not able
And when I when I looked around
I was right back down
Down on my bended knees yes I was oh
Thereve been times that I thought
I thought that I wouldnt last for long
But somehow right now
I believe that Im able Im able to carry on
I tell you that its been a long
And oh its been an uphill journey all the way


But I know I know I know
I know my change is gonna come
Sometimes
I had to cry all night long yes I did
Sometimes
I had to give up right for what I knew was wrong
Yes its been an uphill journey
Its sures been a long way coming yes it has
Its been real hard every step of the way
But I believe I believe
This evening my change is come
Yeah I tell you that my change is come
