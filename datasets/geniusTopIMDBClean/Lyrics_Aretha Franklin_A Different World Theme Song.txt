A Different World (Theme Song) Lyrics
I know my parents loved me
Stand behind me come what may, mmm
I know now that I'm ready, yeah
For I finally heard them say

It's a different world (Ooh, ooh)
Than where you come from
Yes, it is now, yeah
Here's our chance to make it, hey
And if we focus on our goal
You can dish it, we can take it, hey
Just remember that you've been told

It's a different world (It's a different world)
It's a different world (It's a different world)
Yeah, than where you come from
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Than where you come from!You might also likeEmbed
