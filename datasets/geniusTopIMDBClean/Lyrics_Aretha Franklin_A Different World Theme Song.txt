A Different World  Theme Song  Lyrics
I know my parents loved me
Stand behind me come what may mmm
I know now that Im ready yeah
For I finally heard them say
Its a different world  Ooh ooh 
Than where you come from
Yes it is now yeah
Heres our chance to make it hey
And if we focus on our goal
You can dish it we can take it hey
Just remember that youve been told
Its a different world  Its a different world 
Its a different world  Its a different world 
Yeah than where you come from
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Than where you come from
