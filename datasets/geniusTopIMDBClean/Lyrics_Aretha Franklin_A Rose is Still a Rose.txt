Listen dear
I realise that youve been hurt deep
Because Ive been there
But regardless to who what why when and where
Were all precious in his sight
And a rose is still and always will be a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
There was a rose I knew I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth hey hey
She never knew what hit her oh
Steal her honey then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn tryin to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power  what I am is what I am 
Now believe me when I tell you that Ive been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you its you nobody else
And now youre so tough tryin to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin and flossin tryin to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh oh yeah
When she gets nearer
Shes cryin you cant hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn tryin to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl you hold the power  what I am is what I am 
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power  what I am is what I am 
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see youre lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Dont believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl love yourself enough to know
That without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
And without him your life goes on
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl you hold the power  what I am is what I am 
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl youre still a flower
He cant leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin you hold the power  what I am is what I am
