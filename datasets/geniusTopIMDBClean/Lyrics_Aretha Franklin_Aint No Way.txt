Aint no way for me to love you
If you wont let me
It aint no way for me to give you all you need
If you wont let me give all of me
I know that a womans duty
Is to help and love a man
And thats the way it was planned
Oh but how can I how can I how can I
Give you all the things I can
If youre tying both of my hands
Oh oh it aint no way
Aint no way 
It aint no way
Aint no way 
It just aint no way baby
Aint no way 
Aint no way baby
Aint no way 
It aint no way for me to love you
If you wont let me
Stop trying to be someone youre not
How cold and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he got
And if you need me like you say say you do
Oh then please please
Please dont you know that I need you
Oh it aint no way
I tell you that it aint no way
It aint no way it aint no way baby no
It just aint no way
It sure aint no way
It aint no way for me to love you
If you wont let me


No way
If you wont let me
Aint no way
