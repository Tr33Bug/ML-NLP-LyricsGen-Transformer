Amazing Grace Lyrics
Was blind, but now I see

Amazing, amazing grace, how sweet the, the sound
That, that saved a, a wretch like me
I, I once was, was lost, but, but now I, I'm found
Was, was blind, but now, now I, I see

Through, through, through, through
Through many dangers, oh-oh, dangers, toils, woo Lord, toils and, and snares
I, I've been right here in the midst of a heaven
But I'm ready, I've already
Jesus was with me and I've already called, yes, I have
It was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was grace amazing
Has been with me, Lord, and let me see
Don't you know it?
And that same, that same old grace
They call it God's amazing, oh-oh, amazing
Mm, Amazing Grace
It was, it was, I want the world to know that it was
It was, it was, it was grace
Woo-hoo, it was grace, Lord
Oh Lord, hath brought me, me so safe
So safe, so safe, so safe, so safe, so safe, so safe thus far
And it won't be nothin' but that same Grace
I know that it won't, that's gonna lead me at mine, right on, right on
Right on, right on, right on home, yeah

Safe
Safe (So safe)
Safe (So safe)
Safe (Safe with Jesus)
Safe (So safe)
That same grace will lead me home (That same grace will lead me home)
Oh, oh, oh, lead me safe, woo-hoo, hoo-hoo, oh, that grace
The Lord will lead me home
