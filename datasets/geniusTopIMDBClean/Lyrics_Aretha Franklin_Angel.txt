I got a call the other day
It was my sister Carolyn saying
Aretha come by when you can
Ive got something that I wanna say
And when I got there she said
You know rather than go through a long drawn out thing
I think the melody on the box will help me explain
Gotta find me an angel
To fly away with me
Gotta find me an angel
Ooh and set me free
My heart is without a home
I dont want to be alone
I gotta find me an angel
In my life in my life
Too long have I loved
So unattached within
So much that I know
That I need somebody so
So I will just go on
Hoping that I find me someone
Gotta find me an angel in my life
In my life in my life
I know there must be someone
Somewhere for me
Oh I lived too long
Without the love of someone
And theres no misery
Ooh ooh like the misery
I feel in me


I gotta find me an angel in
In my life
Youll meet him now dont you worry 
In my life
Keep looking and just keep cooking 
In my life
Hell be there now dont you worry 
In my life
