If you want my lovin
If you really do
Dont be afraid baby
Just ask me
You know Im gonna give it to you
Oh and I do declare  I do 
I wanna see you with it
Stretch out your arms little boy
Youre gonna get it
Cause I love you
Baby baby baby I love you 
Aint no doubt about it
Baby I love you
Baby baby baby I love you 
I love you I love you
I love you I love you
Baby I love you
If you feel you wanna kiss me
Go right ahead I dont mind
All you got to do is
Snap your fingers
And Ill come runnin
I aint lyin  I aint lyin 
And I heard you once
Little boy you know you got it
Id deny my own self
Before I see you without it
Cause I love you
Baby baby baby I love you 
Aint no doubt about it
Baby I love you
Baby baby baby I love you 
I love you I love you
I love you I love you
Baby I love you
Someday you might want to run away
And leave me sitting here crying
But if its all the same to you baby
Im gonna stop you from saying goodbye
Goodbye 
Baby I love you
Baby baby I love you 
Baby I need you
Baby baby I 
Said I want you
Baby baby I 
Got to have you baby
Baby baby I 
Dont let your neighbors
Baby baby  Tell you
I dont want you
Baby baby 
Dont let you
