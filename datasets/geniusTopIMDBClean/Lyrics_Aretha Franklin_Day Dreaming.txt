Daydreaming and Im thinking of you
Daydreaming and Im thinking of you
Daydreaming and Im thinking of you
Daydreaming and Im thinking of you
Look at my mind floating away
Hes the kind of guy that would say
Hey baby lets get away
Lets go some place huh
Where I dont care
Hes the kind of guy that you give your everything
You trust your heart share all of your love
Til death do you part
I want to be what he wants
When he wants it and whenever he needs it
And when hes lonesome and feeling love starved
Ill be there to feed it
Im loving him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say
Hey baby lets get away
Lets go somewhere far
Baby can we
Where I dont care
Hey baby lets get away
Lets go somewhere far
Baby can we
Where I dont care
I want to be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when hes lonesome and feeling love starved
Ill be there to feed it
Loving him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say
Hey baby lets get away
Lets go somewhere far
Baby can we
Where I dont care
Hey baby lets get away
Lets go somewhere far
Baby can we
Where I dont care
