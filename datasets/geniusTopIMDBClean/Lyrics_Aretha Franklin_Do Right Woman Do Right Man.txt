Do Right Woman, Do Right Man Lyrics
Take me to heart, and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unshown
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Do right, do right, do right, do right man, man)

Yeah, yeah, they say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me

If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Do right, do right, do right, do right man, man)

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man

If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Why don't you? Why don't you? Why don't you? Why don't you?)
You got to be a do right, home nights manYou might also like1Embed
