Take me to heart and Ill always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted leaving love unshown
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong
A womans only human
You should understand
Shes not just a plaything
Shes flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do right home days woman
Do right do right do right do right woman 
Youve got to be a do right home nights man
Do right do right do right do right man man 
Yeah yeah they say that its a mans world
But you cant prove that by me
And as long as were together baby
Show some respect for me
If you want a do right home days woman
Do right do right do right do right woman 
Youve got to be a do right home nights man
Do right do right do right do right man man 
A womans only human
You should understand
Shes not just a plaything
Shes flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do right home days woman
Do right do right do right do right woman 
Youve got to be a do right home nights man
Why dont you Why dont you Why dont you Why dont you 
You got to be a do right home nights man
