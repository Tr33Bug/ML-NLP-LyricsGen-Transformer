Don’t Play That Song Lyrics
Don’t play that song for me
Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you
Oh no! Don’t let them play it (Oh no!)
It fills my heart with pain (It hurts!)
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just a' what he said

He said, darling (Darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (You lied)
Lied (You lied)
You lied (To me)
Hey mister, don’t play it no more
Don’t play it no more
I can’t stand it
Don’t play it no more (No more)
No more (No more)
No more (Can't stand it)
I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he'd be so mean

He told me darling (Darling, I love you)
Baby, baby, you lied (Darling, I need you)
You, you lied (Darling, I love you)
You know that you lied (You lied)
Lied (You lied)
Lied, lied (To me)

O-o-oh darling (Darling, I love you)
You know that you lied, yeah (Darling, I need you)
You know i know you lied (Darling, I love you)
Darling, you lied (You lied)
You lied (You lied)
You lied. You’re all that I need. You lied (To me)
O-u-o-o-o-oh, you lied (Don't play it no more)
Hey baby don’t play it no more (Wo-o-oh, don't play it no more)
Don’t do it. Don’t play it no more (Wo-o-oh, for me)
No more (For me)
I can’t stand it no more (Don't play it no more)
Ouh! Hey! Don’t play it no more (Wo-o-oh, don’t play it no more)You might also like1Embed
