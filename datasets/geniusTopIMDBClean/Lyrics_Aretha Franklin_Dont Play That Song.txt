Dont play that song for me
Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you
Oh no Dont let them play it  Oh no 
It fills my heart with pain  It hurts 
Please stop it right away
Cause I remember just a what he said
He said darling  Darling I I love you 
And I know that he lied  Darling I I love you 
You know that you lied  Darling I I love you 
You know that you lied  You lied 
Lied  You lied 
You lied  To me 
Hey mister dont play it no more
Dont play it no more
I cant stand it
Dont play it no more  No more 
No more  No more

I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed hed be so mean
He told me darling  Darling I love you 
Baby baby you lied  Darling I need you 
You you lied  Darling I love you 
You know that you lied  You lied
