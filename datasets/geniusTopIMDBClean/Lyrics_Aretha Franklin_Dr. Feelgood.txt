Dr Feelgood Lyrics
I dont want nobody always
Sittin around me and my man
I dont want nobody always
Sittin right there
Lookin at me and that man
Be it my mother my brother or my sister
Would you believe Ill get up put on some clothes
Go out and help them find somebody for theirself if I can
Yes I will
Now I dont mind company
Because companys alright with me every once in awhile
Yes it is
I say I dont mind company
Because companys alright with me every once in awhile
Yeah
But oh oh when me and that man get to lovin
I tell you girl I dig you but I just dont have time
To sit and chit and sit and chitchat and smile
Dont send me no doctor
Fillin me up with all of those pills
I got me a man named Doctor Feelgood
And oh yeah that man takes care of all of my pains and my ills
His name is Doctor Feelgood in the morning
And takin care of business is really this mans game
And after one visit to Dr Feelgood
Youll understand why Feelgood is his name
Oh Yeah Ooh
Good God almighty the man sure makes me feel real
Good
