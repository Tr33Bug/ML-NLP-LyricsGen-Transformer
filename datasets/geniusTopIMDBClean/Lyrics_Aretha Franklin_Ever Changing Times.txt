These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
And the ever changing time
Everything is going so much faster
It seems like Im
Watching my life and everything I do
Wondering if the dreams that I believed in
Can still come true
Caught in between it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day keep forgetting whats mine
I got to find me a way less demanding
And were holding on so tight together all of our lives
And I I had some big idea
So much of my life still not completed hopes and fears
Watching it change into something new
Wondering it Im going to find the answer loving you
All of my life it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day keep forgetting whats mine
I got to find me a way less demanding
And were holding on so tight together all of our lives
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times


All of my life it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day keep forgetting whats mine
I got to find me a way less demanding
And were holding on so tight together
And were gonna be alright together all of our lives
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it dont bother me at all
These are ever changing times
