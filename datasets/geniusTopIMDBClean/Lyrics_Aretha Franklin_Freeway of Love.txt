Knew youd be a vision in white
Howd you get your pants so tight
Dont know what youre doing
But you must be living right yeah
We got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump in it aint no sin
Take a ride in my machine
City traffics moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go go go
We going riding on the freeway of love
Winds against our back
We going riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We going riding on the freeway of love
Winds against our back
We riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We cant quit till we get
To the other side
With the radio playing our song
We keep rolling on
Who knows how far a car can get
Before you think about slowing slowing down yeah
City traffics moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go go go
