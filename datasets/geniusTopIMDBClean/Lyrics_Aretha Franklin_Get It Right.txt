Get It Right Lyrics
Alright gang, let's start from number one
Let's throw down 'til it's done

Let's get this thing to working
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start
We all could use the change
Hey, from right now 'til the dawn
We gon' really carry on
We won't stop
Not until we get it right
Out to be on the one
It's not over 'til it's done
It's going to be so good
When we get it right
Got to be willing to try
Even if we get up early
And work overtime
Do it 'til you get it right
It's an incredible high
There's no limit to what's in it
It's yours and mine
So let's do it 'til we get it, get it right

'Til we get it (Make it shout, toss it, turn you inside out)
Do it 'til we get it (Stay with it and get it right)
Do it 'til we get it (Never stop, we could take it to the top)
Do it 'til we get it (Take the time, get it right)

I know just how to do it
To make it really nice
There's no mystery to it
Here's how you get it right
Well, you make it scream, you make it shout
Toss it, turn it inside out
Never quit, stay with it
And get it right
Don't give up, never stop
We can take it to the top
If we just take the time
To get it right

Oh, don't give up now
We can make it, we can take it
Right to the top
Hey-ey, and never stop
Honey, let's reach for the sky
If we keep believing
We can never go to high
Yeah, let's give it a try
Come on let's keep reaching up
Believe if it lasts forever
It's never too much
No way to get enough
Do it 'til we get it right
Even if it takes from morning
'Til way into night
We've got do it 'til we get it, get it right

'Til we get it (Make it shout, toss it, turn you inside out)
Do it 'til we get it (Stay with it and get it right)
Do it 'til we get it (Never stop, we could take it to the top)
