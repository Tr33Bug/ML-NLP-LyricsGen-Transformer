How I Got Over Lyrics
How I got over (How I got over)
How I got over (How I got over)
You know my soul looks back in wonder how I got over
How I got over (How I got over)
How I got over (How I got over)
Oh, my soul looks back in wonder how I got over

Just as soon as I see Jesus (Oh yes)
The man who made me free (Oh yes, oh yes)
It was the man who bled and suffered (Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)
You know, he died for you and for me (Oh yes)
I'm gon' thank you because you brought me, Lord (Oh yes)
I wanna thank you, Jesus, because you taught me (Oh yes, oh yes)
I wanna thank you because he kept me  (Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)
I'ma thank you 'cause you never left me (Oh yes)
I want to sing (Hallelujah)
I just might shout this evening (Troubles over)
My soul looks back in wonder how I got over

How I got over, over
My soul looks back in wonder how I got over
How I got over, over
My soul looks back in wonder how I got over, one more

And I'ma wear a diadem (Oh yes)
In the new Jerusalem (Oh yes, oh yes)
I'ma walk me some streets of gold (Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)
In the homeland of the soul (Oh yes)
I'm gonna view the Host in white (Oh yes)
Who travels both day and night (Oh yes, oh yes)
Coming up from every nation (Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes)
On the way to the great coronation (Oh yes)

I'm gon' sing (Hallelujah)
Ooh, I might shout this evening (Troubles over)
I'ma thank God for all He's done for me, yes, I am
