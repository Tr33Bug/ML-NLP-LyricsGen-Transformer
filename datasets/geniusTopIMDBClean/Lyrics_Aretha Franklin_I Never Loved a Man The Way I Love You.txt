I Never Loved a Man  The Way I Love You  Lyrics
Youre a no good heartbreaker
Youre a liar and youre a cheat
And I dont know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you aint no good
But oh they dont know
That Id leave you if I could
I guess Im uptight
And Im stuck like glue
Cause I aint never
I aint never I aint never no no
Loved a man the way that I I love you
Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that youll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby you know that Im the best thing
That you ever had
Kiss me once again
Dont you never never say that we were through
Cause I aint never
Never Never no no
Loved a man the way that I I love you
I cant sleep at night
And I cant eat a bite
I guess Ill never be free
Since you got your hooks in me
Oh oh oh yeah yeah


I aint never loved a man
I aint never loved a man baby
Aint never had a man hurt me so bad no
Well this is what Im gonna do about it
I tell you Im gonna hold on to it
Yeah Im gonna hold on to it yeah
