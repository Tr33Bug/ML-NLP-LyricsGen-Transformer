I say a little prayer for you 
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup  Makeup 
I say a little  Prayer for you 
And while Im combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now  Wear now 
I say a little  Prayer for you 
Forever  Forever  and ever  Yeah 
Youll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever  Forever  and ever  Ever 
We never will part oh how I love you
Together  Together  together  Together 
Thats how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me  Oohhoo 
I run for the bus dear
But while riding I think of us dear  Us dear 
I say a little  Prayer for you 
And at work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time  Break time 
I say a little  Prayer for you 
Forever  Forever  and ever  Ever 
Youll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever  Forever  and ever  Ever 
We never will part oh how I love you
Together  Together  together  Together 
Thats how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me  Nobody but me 
Forever  Ever  and ever  Ever 
Youll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever  Forever  and ever  Ever 
We never will part oh how I love you
Together  Together  together  Together

Would only mean heartbreak for me  Ooh oohhoo
