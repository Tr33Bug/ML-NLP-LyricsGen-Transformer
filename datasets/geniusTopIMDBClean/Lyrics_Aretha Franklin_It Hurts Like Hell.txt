Oh baby
Ohhhhh
Oh baby
Ohhhhh
Oh babe
Love was always supposed to be
Something wonderful to me
To watch it grow inside yourself
To feel your heart beside itself
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
When you know youve given all you can 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
You do your best but its still much too bad 
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
Thats the way it feels
True love
It has no hiding place
Its not something you just put away
Its always there inside of you
Ohhh and it shows in everything you do
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
When you know youve given it your best 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
You feel a thousand miles from happiness 
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
Thats the way it feels
Here we are the two of us
So full of love so little trust
But dying for some tenderness
Ooohhh but too afraid to take the step
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
When you know what it can put you through 
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
Theres nothing funny if its killing you 
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
Thats the way it feels
I know if there is any chance
For us to find our happiness
Weve got to learn to let it go
Ohhh oh forget all the pain we knew
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
Sometimes it hurts it hurts to even laugh
And it hurts like hell
Thats the way
Oh baby
Thats the way it feels
