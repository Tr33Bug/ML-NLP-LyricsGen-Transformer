The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Oh Im happy with my someone new
Im laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause Im still in love with you
They see me night and daytime
Oh Im having such a gay time
But they dont know what I go through
Im laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause Im still in love with you
No one knows its just a pose
Pretending Im glad were apart
And when I cry my eyes are dry
All of the tears are in my heart
So darling cant we make up
Ever ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
Im laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause Im still in love with you
Mhm Im still laughing on the outside
But every day Im crying on the inside
Because Im still still in love with you
