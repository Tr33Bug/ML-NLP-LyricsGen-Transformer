O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
How lovely are thy branches
O Christmas tree O Christmas tree
How lovely are thy branches
Your boughs so green in summertime
Stay bravely green in wintertime
O tannenbaum O Christmas tree
How lovely are thy branches
Let us all remember
In our gift giving and our merriment
With our family and friends and loved ones
The real and true meaning of Christmas
The birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
O tannenbaum O tannenbaum
How lovely are are thy branches
O tannenbaum O tannenbaum
How lovely are how lovely are thy branches
The pillars all please faithfully
Our trust in God unchangedly
O tannenbaum O tannenbaum
How love lovely are thy branches
On Comet on Cupid on Donner and Blitzen
Ha ha ha ha
