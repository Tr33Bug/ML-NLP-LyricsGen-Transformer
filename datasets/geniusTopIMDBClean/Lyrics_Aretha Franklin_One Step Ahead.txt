Im only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all Id have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be
Im only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I cant afford to stop for one moment
Cause Im just out of reach of your fingertips
Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That its too soon to forget you
Its too late to be free cant you see
Im only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I cant take two
Seems like Ill have to take that one step backwards
Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from you
