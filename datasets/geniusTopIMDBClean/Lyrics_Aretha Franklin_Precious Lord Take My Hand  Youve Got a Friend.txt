Precious Lord, Take My Hand / Youâ€™ve Got a Friend LyricsYou need a friend
And Jesus said, "Call my name
And I'll be there"
When you're down and troubled
You need some loving care
Ain't nothing
Ain't nothing going right
Close, close your eyes
And meditate on Him
And soon, He will be there
God can brighten up
He can brighten up your darkest hours
Precious Lord, take my hand (Take my hand)
Lead me on, let me stand (Let me stand)
I am tired (I am tired), I am weak (I am weak), I am worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand, precious Lord, He's my friend
(You just call out His name) Precious Lord, take my hand
(And you know wherever you are) Lead me on, let me stand
(He will be there to see you again) I get tired, I am weak, and I get worn, I get worn
(Winter, spring, summer or fall) Through the storm, through the night
(All you got to do is call) Lead me on Lord to the light
And He'll be there, ooh
