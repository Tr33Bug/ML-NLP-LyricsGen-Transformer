Precious memories how they linger 
How they ever  How they ever
Flood my soul  Flood my soul
In the stillness  Lord in the stillness
Of the midnight  The midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold  Sacred sacred hell unfold oh yeah yes He will
In sad hours  Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
We forget a little loan  Yeah yeah yeah
The truth the real truth the real truth of Jesus 
Loving told oh yeah oh yeah 
Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus  Jesus 
Jesus whisper  yeah 
Yeah yeah I Ill be with you oh yes he does
Yes I will I
Sacred  sacred 
Sacred  sacred 
Sacred scenes  sacred 
Yes he will
Every every every now and then you gonna get a little lonely  Yes you are yes you will
But the truth the real truth the real truth of Jesus 
Loving told

Jesus whispers
