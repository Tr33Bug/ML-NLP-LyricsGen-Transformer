Rescue Me Lyrics
Rescue me
Oh take me in your arms
Rescue me
I want your tender charms
Cause i'm lonely and i'm blue
I need you and your love too

Come on and rescue me
Come on baby and rescue me
Come on baby and rescue me
Cause i need you, by my side
Can't you see that i'm lonely
Rescue me
Come on and take my heart
Take your love and conquer every part
Cause i'm lonely and i'm blue
I need you and your love too


Rescue me
Oh take me in your arms
Rescue me
I want your tender charms
Cause i'm lonely and i'm blue
I need you and your love too
Come on and rescue me
Come on baby, take me baby, hold me baby, love me baby
Can't you see that i need you baby
Can't you see that i'm lonely
Rescue me

Come on and take my hand
Come on baby and be my man
Cause i love you 'cause i want you
Can't you see that i'm lonely?
Take me baby
Love me baby
Need me baby
Can't you see that i'm lonely?
Rescue me, rescue me.......You might also likeEmbed
