Rock steady baby
Thats what I feel now
Lets call this song exactly what it is
Step and move your hips with a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride
And while youre moving rock steady
Rock steady baby
Lets call this song exactly what it is
What it is what it is what it is 
Its a funky and low down feeling  What it is 
In my hips from left to right  What it is 
What it is is I might be doing  What it is 
This funky dance all night
Oh  Wave your hands up in the air 
Oh  Got the feeling and aint got a care 
Oh  What fun to take this ride 
Rock steady will only slide 
Rock steady
Rock steady baby
Rock steady
Rock steady baby
Step and move your hips with a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride
While youre moving rock steady
Rock steady
Lets call this song exactly what it is
What it is what it is what it is 
Its a funky and low down feeling  What it is 
In my hips from left to right  What it is 
What it is is I might be doing  What it is 
This funky dance all night
Oh  Wave your hands up in the air 
Got the feeling and aint got a care 
Oh  What fun to take this ride 
Rock steady will only slide 
Rock steady baby
Rock steady woo
Rock steady
Rock steady
Rock steady
What it is 
Its a funky and low down feeling  What it is 
In my hips from left to right  What it is 
What it is is I might be doing  What it is 
This funky dance all night
Oh  Wave your hands up in the air 
Oh  Got the feeling and aint got a care 
Oh  What fun to take this ride 
Rock steady will only slide 
Rock steady
Steady baby
Rock
Rock steady baby
Baby
What it is 
Baby baby
What it is 
Baby
What it is 
Baby
