Rock Steady Lyrics
Rock steady, baby
That's what I feel now
Let's call this song exactly what it is
Step and move your hips with a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride
And while you're moving rock steady
Rock steady, baby

Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is, what it is, what it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling (What it is)
In my hips from left to right (What it is)
What it is is I might be doing (What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh (Wave your hands up in the air)
Oh (Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh (What fun to take this ride)
(Rock steady will only slide)
Rock steady
Rock steady, baby
Rock steady
Rock steady, baby

Step and move your hips with a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride
While you're moving rock steady
Rock steady

Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is, what it is, what it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling (What it is)
In my hips from left to right (What it is)
What it is is I might be doing (What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh (Wave your hands up in the air)
(Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh (What fun to take this ride)
(Rock steady will only slide)

Rock steady, baby
Rock steady, woo
Rock steady
You might also like
Rock steady
Rock steady

(What it is)
It's a funky and low down feeling (What it is)
In my hips from left to right (What it is)
What it is is I might be doing (What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh (Wave your hands up in the air)
Oh (Got the feeling and ain't got a care)
Oh (What fun to take this ride)
(Rock steady will only slide)

Rock steady
Steady, baby
Rock
Rock steady, baby
Baby
(What it is)
Baby, baby
(What it is)
Baby
(What it is)
