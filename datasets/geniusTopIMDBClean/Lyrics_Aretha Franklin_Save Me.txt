Save me somebody save me
Save me somebody save me yeah
Promised myself after the first romance
I wouldnt give you a second chance
They say if you seek youre sure to find
But the closer I get to you baby
You drive me stone outta my mind
Save me oh yeah
Save me yeah yeah
Those who love always give the most
Were crying together from coast to coast
Love leaves us cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours unjustified
Begging you to save me
Yeah I need somebody to save me yeah hey hey hey
Your love said you needed me
You abused my love set me free
You didnt need you didnt want me
Somebody help me this man wants to taunt me
Im begging you to oh
Save me yeah
Please save me
Calling the Caped Crusader Green Hornet Kato too
Im in so much trouble I dont know what to do
If you think anything about me
Save me oh yeah yeah come on
I just said save me baby come on
Save me save me
Oh save me
Oh save me
