Son of a Preacher Man Lyrics
Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gather 'round the parlour talking
That's when Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
The only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Ohh Hallelujah)
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talking to me
He keeps 'n tellin' me "Everything is all right" (Sock it to me)
Baby baby "Everything is all right"
(Ohh Sock it to me)
Can I sneak away again tonight now

The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Haaaa)

Hmmmm
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each other's knowing
Looking to see how much we're growing
You might also like
The only boy who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Ohh, yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Ohh Hallelujah)
Hallelujah
(Son of a preacher man, Hallelujah)
Hallelujah for the son, now yeah
(Son of a preacher man, Hallelujah)
Hallelujah, yeah
(Son of a preacher man, Hallelujah)
For the son, Halle- Hallelujah for the son, now
(Son of a preacher man)
He was the only boy, yes he is, who could ever reach me
(Son of a preacher man)
He's the only boy who could ever teach me
(Son of a preacher man)1Embed
