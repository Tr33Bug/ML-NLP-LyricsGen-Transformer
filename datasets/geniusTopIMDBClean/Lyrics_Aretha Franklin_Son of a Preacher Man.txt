Billy Ray was a preachers son
And when his daddy would visit hed come along
When they gather round the parlour talking
Thats when Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard wed go walking
Then hed look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man 
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man 
Yes he was  Hallelujah 
Yeah he was  Hallelujah 
Ohh he was  Ohh Hallelujah 
Being good isnt always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweettalking to me
He keeps n tellin me Everything is all right  Sock it to me 
Baby baby Everything is all right
Ohh Sock it to me 
Can I sneak away again tonight now
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that hes all mine
Learning from each others knowing
Looking to see how much were growing
The only boy who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man 
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man 
Ohh yes he was  Hallelujah
