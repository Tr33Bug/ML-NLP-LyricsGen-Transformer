There is a fountain that I see
Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuels vein
The sinners sinners plunged beneath that blood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
The sinners sinners plunged beneath beneath that blood
Theyre gonna lose all their guilty stains
Mmm mmm ooh Lord mmm mmm
The sinners sinners plunged beneath beneath that blood
Theyre gonna lose all their guilty stains
