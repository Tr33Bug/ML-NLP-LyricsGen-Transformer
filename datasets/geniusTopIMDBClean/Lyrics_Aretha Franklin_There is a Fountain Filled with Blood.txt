There is a Fountain Filled with Blood Lyrics
There is a fountain that I see
Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath that blood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath, beneath that blood
They're gonna lose all their guilty stains

Mmm, mmm, ooh Lord, mmm, mmm
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath, beneath that blood
They're gonna lose all their guilty stainsYou might also likeEmbed
