Until You Come Back to Me   Thats What Im Gonna Do  Lyrics
Though you dont call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess Ill rap on your door  Your door 
Tap on your window pane  Tap on your window pane 
I want to tell you baby
Changes Ive been going through
Missing you listen you
Til you come back to me thats what Im gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free
Im going to swallow my pride  My pride 
Im going to beg you to please baby please see me  Baby wont you see me 
Im going to walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true
All for you baby
Til you come back to me thats what Im gonna do
Living for you my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea  Hear my plea 
Ive got to make you see  Make you see 
That our love is dying  Our love is dying 
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must somehow I must how I must explain
Im going to rap on your door  Your door 
Tap on your window pane  Tap on your window pane 
Im going to camp by your steps
Until I get through to you  Uuuh 
Ive got to change your view baby
Til you come back to me thats what Im gonna do
Til you come back to me thats what Im gonna do
Til you come back to me thats what Im gonna do
Im going to rap on your door  Tap on 
Tap on your window pane  Tap on 
Open out baby Im gonna rap on your door  Tap on 
Tap on your tap on your  Tap on 
Tap on your tap on your window pane  Tap on your window pane 
Im going to rap on your door  Rap on 
Tap on your window pane  Tap on 
Open out baby
