Walk in the Light Lyrics
Jesus is the light of the world
Come on, choir

Walk in the light (Walk in the light)
Beautiful light (Well, it's a beautiful light)
Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright
Oh, shine all around us by day and by night
Jesus is the light of the world
(I wonder do you know it this evening, yeah, yeah)
Walk in the light (We're gonna walk in the light)
Beautiful light (Well, the beautiful light)
Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright
Oh, shine all around us by day and by night (Oh Lord)
Jesus is the light of the world (Oh, oh yeah)
Walk in the light (We're going distance, yeah)
Beautiful light (We're going the distance with the Lord, oh yeah)
Come where the dewdrops of mercy shine bright
Oh, shine all around us by day and by night (Oh Lord)
Jesus is the light of the world

He's shining (Yes, He's shining)
He's shining (Oh yes He is, He's shining)You might also likeEmbed
