I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume
It must have come from you
How could you touch her
Lay down beside her
Well there just aint no excuse
You shouldnt have been so loose
I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then youre wasting your time
Well Im willing to forgive you but I cant forget
Cause you really really really really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
Ive been busy busy busy busy thinking that Im gonna mess around some time
Youre such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin waitin on you
How could you do it
You shouldve been here with me
You just couldnt do it
You had to be in the streets
Well I heard through the grapevine
Youve been messin around
When you thought you were gettin over
Thats when a baby girl found out
Well Im willing to forgive you but I cant forget
Cause you really really really really hurt me this time
You really hurt me 
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
Ive been busy busy busy busy thinking that Im gonna mess around some time


I gave my heart gave my time
Gave my soul cause love was blind
I cant explain this poor excuse
Of a man of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess  Guess I  Im in love
Well Im willing to forgive you but I cant forget
Oh baby Im in love Im in love Im in love Im in love 
Cause you really really really really hurt me this time
Ooh you really hurt me this time baby 
And I guess I can go on although I must admit  Although I must admit 
Ive been busy busy busy busy thinking that Im gonna mess around some time
Im gonna mess around some time 
I gave my heart gave my time
Gave my soul cause love was blind
I cant explain this poor excuse
Of a man of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess IIm in love
Well Im willing to forgive you but I cant forget
Cause you really really really really hurt me this time
Ooh oh baby you hurt me you hurt me 
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
Ive been busy busy busy busy thinking that Im gonna mess around some time
Well Im willing to forgive you but I cant forget
Im willin Im willin and able 
Cause you really really really really hurt me this time
