Willing To Forgive Lyrics
I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume
It must have come from you
How could you touch her?
Lay down beside her?
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose

I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it?
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets

Well, I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when a baby girl found out

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(You really hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
You might also like
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(Oh, baby, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, you really hurt me this time, baby)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit (Although I must admit)
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
(I'm gonna mess around some time)

I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I...I'm in love
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, oh, baby, you hurt me, you hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(I'm willin', I'm willin' and able)
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time...Embed
