You Make Me Feel Like  A Natural Woman Lyrics
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
And youre the key to my peace of mind
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman 
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didnt know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now Im no longer doubtful of what Im living for
And if I make you happy I dont need to do more
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman 
Oh baby what youve done to me  What youve done to me 
You made me feel so good inside  Good inside 
And I just wanna be  Wanna be 
Close to you you make me feel so alive
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman 
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman 
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
