Once upon a time a long long time ago wherever youd lead me I would surely follow
Girl you put me through some pain and misery
And now you are standing on my doorstep telling me how much you need me
Baby aint nobody home
Aint nobody home
How many times I begged for you to come home but you laughed at me and said let me alone
Through my falling tears I saw you walk away
And now youre beggin me to forgive you but this time baby its your turn to beg
Baby aint nobody home
Aint nobody home
Girl I used to love you placed no one else above you
Gave you everything that I own
Girl you cant come back here
Aint nobody home
Once upon a time when you went on your way
But girl I hoped and prayed that youd come back some day
But time has made some changes turned me upside down
So you can beg me to forgive you but this time baby you can turn right around
Aint nobody home
Aint nobody home
Girl you hurt me once
I hear you knockin
