If I attend church all day Sunday come back home and raise
spoken  I think I feel hur or shall I go a little further do a little more
Aint nobodys bizness what I do
If one day I have ham and bacon and the next day aint nothin shakin
No it aint nobodys bizness what I do
Aint Nobodys Bizness from earlies 60s
If me and my baby fuss and fight
Well and the next minute were all right
It aint nobodys bizness what I do
If one day we have ham and bacon
And the next day aint nothing shakin
I tell you it aint nobodys bizness what I do
Oh Im three three times seven
Oh that makes twentyone
Ah that aint nobodys bizness what I do
Oh if I attend church all day Sunday
And cabaret all day Monday
It aint nobodys bizness what I do
If I stay out all night
Spending my money I tell you thats all right
Because it aint nobodys bizness what I do
It aint nobodys bizness what I do
