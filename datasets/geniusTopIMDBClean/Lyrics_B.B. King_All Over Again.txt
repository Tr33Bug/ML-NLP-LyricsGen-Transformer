Ive got a good mind to give up living and go shopping instead
I say Ive got a good mind to give up living and go shopping instead
To pick up me a tombstone and be pronounced dead
When I read your letter this morning that was in your place in bed
I read your letter this morning that was in your place in bed
Thats when I decided that I would be better off dead
It read there is no use you looking or ever hoping to get me back
Oh theres no use you looking or ever hoping to get me back
Yes because its all over now and you can bet on that
