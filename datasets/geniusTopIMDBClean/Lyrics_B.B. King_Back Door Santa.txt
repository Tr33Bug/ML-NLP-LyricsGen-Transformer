They call me the Back Door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
They call me the Back Door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
I make all the little girls happy
While the boys are out to play
I aint like the old Saint Nick
He dont come but once a year
I aint like the old Saint Nick
He dont come but once a year
I come runnin with my presents
Every time they call me dear
I keep some change in my pocket
In case the children are home
I give em a few pennies so that we can be alone
I leave the back door open so if anybody smells a mouse
And wouldnt old Santa be in trouble if there aint no
Chimney in the house
They call me the Back Door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
I make all the little girls happy
While all the boys are out to play
They call me the Back Door Santa
Yeah thats what they call me
They call me the Back Door Santa
Yeah thats what they call me
