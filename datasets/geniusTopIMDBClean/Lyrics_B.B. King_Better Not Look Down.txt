Ive been around and Ive seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People living like Superman
All day and all night
And I wont say if its wrong or if its right
Im pretty fast myself
But I do have some advice to pass along
Right here in the words of this song
Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you dont look down
An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl have lived in love and for love
And over love and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupids bow that had
Passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like
A porcupine and she asked me
BB do you think Ive lived my life all wrong
And I said The only advice I have to pass
Along is concealed in the chorus of this song
Girl
Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you dont look down
I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning
In London England
And there was a very large Rolls Royce Limousine
Pulling slowly along the street
And in that Rolls Royce was the Queen of England
Looking tired
Just go back from a party and the Queen leaned out and
She said Arent you BB King She said
Oh BB sometimes its so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think I ought to do
And I said

You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you dont look down
You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you dont look down
You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
