Ive traveled for miles around
Seems like everybody wanna put me down
Because Im a bluesman
But Im a good man understand
I went down to the bus station
Look upon the wall
My money is to light people
Couldnt go no where at all
Im a bluesman
But Im a good man understand
The burden that I carry oh is so heavy
It seems like aint nobody in this great big world
That would wanna wanna help old B
Hey but Ill I would be all right people
Just give me a break good things come
The those wait and Ive waited a long time
Im a bluesman
But Im a good man understand
