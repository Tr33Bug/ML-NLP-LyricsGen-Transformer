Well I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin in the deep blue sea
Id have all you women
Fishin after me
Fishin after me
Fishin after me
Well Im broke and Im hungry
Ragged and Im dirty too
Well if I clean up baby can I
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
If I cant cant come in
Let me sit down front of your door
Ill leave so early your
Mom wont know
Wont never know
Wont never know
Oh I know know my baby
Well shes going to jump and shout
When my train pulls in and I
I come walkin out
Come walkin out
Come walkin out
Yes Im goin babe Im goin
And your crying wont make me stay
Oh the more that you cry baby
More Ill go away
More Ill go away
More Ill go away
Well now I know I know you dont want me
Why in the world wont you tell me so
Then I wont be caught baby round
Your house no more
Your house no more
Your house no more
