Woke up this morning
After another one of those crazy dreams
Oh nothing is going right this morning
The whole world is wrong it seems
Oh I guess its the chain that binds me
I cant shake it loose these chains and things
Got to work this morning
Seems like everything is lost
I got a goldhearted wrongdoing woman
And a slavedriving ball
I cant loosen these chains that bind me
Cant shake them loose these chains and things
Just cant loosen these chains and things
Well you talk about hard luck and trouble
Seems to be my middle name
All the odds are against me
Yes I can only play a losing game
These chains that bind me
Cant loosen these chains and things
Just cant loosen these chains and things
Oh I would pack up and leave today people
But I aint got nowhere to go
Aint got money to buy a ticket
And I dont feel like walking anymore
These chains that bind me
I cant lose I cant lose these chains and things
