Darlinâ€™ You Know I Love You LyricsDarlin', darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else
I think of you, think of you every morning
I dream of you, every night
And I'd love to be with you always
When night began to fall
I cry, cry alone
And I wish, I could hold you in my arms tonight
Darlin', Darlin' you know I love you
I love you, for myself
But you're gone, gone and left me for someone elseYou might also likeEmbed
