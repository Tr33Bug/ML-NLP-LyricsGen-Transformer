Darlin darlin you know I love you
I love you for myself
But youre gone gone and left me for someone else
I think of you think of you every morning
I dream of you every night
And Id love to be with you always
When night began to fall
I cry cry alone
And I wish I could hold you in my arms tonight
Darlin Darlin you know I love you
I love you for myself
But youre gone gone and left me for someone else
