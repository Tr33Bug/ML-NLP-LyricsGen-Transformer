Baby I dont wanna a soul
Hangin around my house when Im not home
Oh I dont want a soul baby
Hangin around my house when Im not home
I dont want you to open the door for nobody woman
Oh when youre home and you know youre all alone
Your sister might wanna visit us
But the little girl she talk too much
If she just come by to visit us
Tell her to meet us Sunday Sunday down at the church
Cause I dont want a soul baby
Hangin around my house when Im not at home
Yes I dont want you to open the door for nobody baby
Oh when youre home and you know youre all alone
Your mother might wanna visit us
But you tell you mamma I get home bout the break a day
And thats too late to visit anybody baby
So tell you mamma to please please please stay away
Cause I dont want a soul baby
Hangin around my house when Im not at home
Yes I dont want you to open the door for anybody woman
Oh when youre home and you know youre all alone
You might feel a little sick baby
And you know youre home all alone
I dont want the doctor at my house baby
You just suffer suffer suffer till I get home
Cause I dont want a soul baby
Hangin around my house when Im not at home
Yes I dont want you to open the door for nobody woman
Baby when youre home and all alone
Yeah
