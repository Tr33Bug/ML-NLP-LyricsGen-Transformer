Its early in the morning and I cant get right
Cause I had a little date with my baby last night
Now its early in the morning
Its early in the morning
Its early in the morning
And I aint got nothin but the blues
I went to all the places where we used to go
I went to her house but she dont live there no more
And its early in the morning
Its early in the morning
Its early in the morning
And I aint got nothin but the blues
I went to her girlfriends house but she was out
I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout
Get away from here
Too early in the morning
Its early in the morning
Its early in the morning
And I aint got nothin but the blues
Went to Jenny Lous to get something to eat
The waitress looked at me she said B you sure look beat
Its early in the morning baby
Early in the morning
Its early in the morning
And I aint got nothin but the blues
Had a lot of money when I first started out
I couldnt find my baby now my moneys run out
Now its early in the morning
Its early in the morning
Its early in the morning
And I aint got nothin but the blues
Its early in the morning
I aint got nothin but the blues
