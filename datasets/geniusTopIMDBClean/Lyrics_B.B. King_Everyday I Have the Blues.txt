Everyday everyday I have the blues
Ooooh everyday everyday I have the blues
When you see me worryin baby
Because its you I hate to lose
Well nobody loves me nobody seems to care
Oh nobody loves me nobody seems to care
Well those worries and trouble darling
Babe you know I had my share
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Everyday  I have the blues
When you see me worryin baby
Because its you I hate to lose
Oh nobody loves me nobody seems to care
Oh nobody loves me nobody seems to care
Well those worries and trouble darling
Babe you know I had my share
