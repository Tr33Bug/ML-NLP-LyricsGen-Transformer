Shes a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
Oh poor ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
Shes just a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
To come home
A rat run cross the floor a roach turn up the wall
Everything is noisy around her that dont seem to bother her at all
Cause shes a ghetto woman sittin there all alone
Shes just a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
To come home
Yes the tvs on radio blastin the news
Somebody down the hall playin the low down dirty blues
My ghetto woman shes all alone
Shes just a ghetto woman waitin for her man to come home
To come home
Cause shes a ghetto woman said shes a ghetto woman
Oh ghetto woman whats on your mind
Sometimes I look in your face cant help but cry
