Sometimes I get impatient but she cools me without words
And she comes so sweet and softly my hummingbird
And have you heard that I thought my life had ended
But I find that its just begun cause she gets me where I live
Ill give all I have to give Im talking about that hummingbird
Oh shes little and she loves me too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
Shes little and she loves me to my lucky day
Hummingbird dont fly away
When Im feeling wild and lonesome she knows the words to say
And she gives me a little understanding in her special way
And I just have to say in my life I loved a woman
Because shes more than I deserve and she gets me where I live
Ill give all I have to give Im talking about that hummingbird
Oh shes little and she loves me too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
Shes little and she loves me to my lucky day
Hummingbird dont fly away
When Im feeling wild and lonesome she knows the words to say
And she gives me a little understanding in her special way
And I just have to say in my life I loved a woman
Because shes more than I deserve and she gets me where I live
Ill give all I have to give Im talking about that hummingbird
Oh shes little and she loves me too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
Shes little and she loves me to my lucky day
Hummingbird dont fly away
Dont fly away away dont fly away away
Dont fly away away dont fly away away
Dont fly away away dont fly away away
Dont fly away away
Dont fly away away dont fly away away
Dont fly away away dont fly away away
Dont fly away away dont fly away away
