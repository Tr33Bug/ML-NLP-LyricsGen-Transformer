Oh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Oh I need you baby
Come on back home to me
Ill make it all up to you woman
Just you wait around and see
I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
I know I was wrong baby
I thought I was having fun
Yes I was young and foolish
I didnt know you was the one
Now Ive settled down baby
And I know Ill treat you right
Oh Ive settled down baby
And I know Ill treat you right
Yes come on home now baby
I want you to come on home tonight
Oh I need you baby
Yes I need you baby
Well I need you woman
I need a good woman around
Every night about this time baby
My love comes tumbling down
