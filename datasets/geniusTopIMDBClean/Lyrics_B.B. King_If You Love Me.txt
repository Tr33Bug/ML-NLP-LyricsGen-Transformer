If you love me
You will give your heart
Why should be apart
If you love me
If you love me
You will know the truth
I wasnt born to lose
And I love you
Affinity and communication
That makes reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me
If I love you
I will find the key
If its meant to be
Cause I love you
Affinity and communication
That makes that makes that makes reality
Understanding is the first thing
It means so much to me
If I love you
I will find the key
If its meant to be
Cause I love you
