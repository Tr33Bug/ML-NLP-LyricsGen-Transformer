Im working on the building
Its a true foundation
Im lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Ill have a good time
Working on the building
Im going to heaven
To get my reward
When you see me praying
Im working on the building
Im lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Well Ill never get tired
Working on the building
Im going to heaven
To get my reward
When you hear me singing
Im working on the building
Im lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Well Ill never get tired
Working on the building
Im going to heaven
To get my reward
When you hear me crying
Im working on the building
Im lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord
Well Ill never get tired
Working on the building
Im going to heaven
To get my reward
Im working on the building
Its a true foundation
Im lifting up a bloodstained
Banner for the Lord

Well Ill never get tired
Working on the building
Im going to heaven
To get my reward
