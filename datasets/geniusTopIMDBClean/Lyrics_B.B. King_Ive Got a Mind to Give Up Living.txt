Ive got a good mind to give up living and go shopping
Instead
I say Ive got a good mind to give up living and go
Shopping instead
To pick up me a tombstone and be pronounced dead
When I read your letter this morning that was in your
Place in bed
I read your letter this morning that was in your place
In bed
And thats when I decided that I would be better off
Dead
It read there is no use you looking or ever hoping to
Get me back
Oh theres no use you looking or ever hoping to get me
Back
Yes because its all over now and baby you can bet on
That
