Hey everybody lets have some fun
You only live but once
And when youre dead youre done so
Let the good times roll let the good times roll
I dont care if youre young or old
Get together let the good times roll
Dont sit there mumblin talkin trash
If you wanna have a ball
You gotta go out and spend some cash and
Let the good times roll let the good times roll
I dont care if youre young or old
Get together let the good times roll
Hey Mr Landlord lock up all the doors
When the police comes around
Just tell em that the joint is closed
Let the good times roll let the good times roll
I dont care if youre young or old
Get together let the good times roll
Hey tell everybody
Mr Kings in town
I got a dollar and a quarter
Just rarin to clown
But dont let nobody play me cheap
I got fifty cents more that Im gonna keep so
Let the good times roll let the good times roll
I dont care if youre young or old
Get together let the good times roll
No matter whether rainy weather
Birds of a feather gotta stick together
So get yourself under control
Go out and get together and let the good times roll
