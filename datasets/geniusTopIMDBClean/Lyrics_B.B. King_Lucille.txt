The sound that youre listenin to
Is from my guitar thats named Lucille
Im very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame
I dont think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when Im blue its seems like Lucille
Tryin to help me callin my name
I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille started singin blues
Well now when Im payin my dues
Maybe you dont know what I mean when I say payin my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always I can always you you know like depend on Lucille
Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess Ill let Lucille say
All of a few words and then
You know I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that Ive gone through
Like well for instance if I have a girlfriend and shes misusin me
And I go home at night maybe Im lonely
Well not maybe I am lonely
I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I cant even say nothin
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin
You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr
I dont think I still could do it
Cause Lucille dont wanna play nothin but the blues
And I think Im I think Im pretty glad about that
Cause dont nobody sing to me like Lucille sing Lucille
Well Ill put it like this take it easy Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank Sammy little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this
A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille take it easy now
You know Ive met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two three times
No kidding really has
I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin over it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me really it held it up off of me
So thats one time it saved my life
The way the way I uh I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist Arkansas I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin you know what I mean
And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin to save Lucille
Uh oh I I imagine youre still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And thats been Lucille ever since to me
One more now Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me can I do one more
Look out Lucille
Sounds really good I think Ill try one more alright
