Three days of snow in Birmingham
Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
Its no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said You moved away
And left me all your bills to pay
Look out baby you might have made your move too soon
Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure aint hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you aint living here no more
Its too bad
I think you made your move too soon
Ive been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
Im just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin everywhere
I came back and they still care you know
One love ahead
One love behind
One in my arms and one on my mind
Its one thing baby
I never make my move too soon
Ive been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
Im just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin everywhere
I come back you know they still all care
One love ahead and one behind
One in my arms you know one on my mind
And its one thing people
I never make my move too soon
