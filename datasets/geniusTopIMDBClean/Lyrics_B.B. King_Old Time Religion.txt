Old Time Religion LyricsGive me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It is good enough for me
It was good for my old mother
It was good for my old mother
It was good for my old mother
And it's good enough for me
It was good for the Hebrew children
It was good for the Hebrew children
It was good for the Hebrew children
And it's good enough for me
It was good for Paul and Silas
It was good for Paul and Silas
It was good for Paul and Silas
And it's good enough for me
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It is good enough for me
It was good for my old father
It was good for my old father
It was good for my old father
And it's good enough for me
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It is good enough for me
It was good for the Hebrew children
It was good for the Hebrew children
It was good for the Hebrew children
And it's good enough for me
I want that old time religion
I want that old time religion
I want that old time religion
It is good enough for meYou might also likeEmbed
