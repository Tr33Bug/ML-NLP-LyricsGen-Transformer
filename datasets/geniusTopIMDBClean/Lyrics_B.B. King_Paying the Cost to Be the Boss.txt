You act like you dont want to listen
When Im talking to you
You think you outta do baby
Anything you wanna do
You must be crazy baby
You just gotta be outta your mind
As long as Im payin the bills woman
Im payin the cost to be the boss
Ill drink if I want to
And play a little poker too
Dont you say nothing to me
As long as Im taking care of you
As long as Im workin baby
And payin all the bills
I dont want no mouth from you
About the way Im supposed to live
You must be crazy woman
Just gotta be outta your mind
As long as I foot the bills
Im payin the cost to be the boss
Now that you got me
You act like you ashamed
You dont act like my woman
You just usin my name
I tell you Im gonna have all the money
And I dont want no backtalk
Cause if you dont like the way Im doin
Just pick up your things and walk
You gotta be crazy baby
You must be outta your mind
As long as Im payin the bills woman
Im payin the cost to be the boss
