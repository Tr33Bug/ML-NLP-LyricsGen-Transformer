Rock Me Baby LyricsRock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, honey, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby
Like my back ain't got no bones
Roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
I want you to roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby
You don't know how it makes me feel
Rock me baby, honey, rock me slow
Yeah, rock me pretty baby, baby rock me slow
Want you to rock me baby
Till I want no moreYou might also likeEmbed
