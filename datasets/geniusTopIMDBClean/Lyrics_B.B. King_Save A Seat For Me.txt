Save A Seat For Me LyricsI have a few more
Tears to shed
I have a few more
Burdens to bear
I have a few more
Times to give up the right
For the wrong
But I'm gonna keep on
Pressing on the word
Till my battle if fought
My victory is won
But if u make it in Glory
Be for I do
Save a seat for me
Tell my mother to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I'm on my way home
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I want you to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
I just want you to save
(Save a seat for me)
Save a seat for me
(Save a seat for me)
Sometimes I've been up
Sometimes I've been down
Sometimes I've been leveled
I've been leveled down to the ground
But if you make it in glory
Be for I do
Save a seat for meYou might also likeEmbed
