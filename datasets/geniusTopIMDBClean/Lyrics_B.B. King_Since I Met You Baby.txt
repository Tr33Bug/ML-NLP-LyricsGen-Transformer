Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
And everybody tells me
That Im not the same
I dont need nobody
To tell my troubles to
I dont need nobody
To tell my troubles to
Cause since I met you baby
All I need you is you
Since I met you baby
Im a happy man
Since I met you baby
Im a happy man
Im gonna try to please you
In every way I can
Since I met you baby
Im a happy man
Since I met you baby
Im a happy man
For since I met you baby
All I need is you
All I need is you
