Stand By Me LyricsWhen the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Light we'll see
No I won't be afraid
No I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
Refrain:
So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky we look upon
Should trumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble
To the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't she'd a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
