When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Light well see
No I wont be afraid
No I wont be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
Refrain
So darlin darlin
Stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky we look upon
Should trumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble
To the sea
I wont cry I wont cry
No I wont shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
Refrain  2x
