When I first met you baby
Baby you were just sweet sixteen
When I first met you baby
Baby you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then woman
Ah the sweetest thing Id ever seen
But you wouldnt do nothing baby
You wouldnt do anything I asked to
You wouldnt do nothing for me baby

You know you ran away from your home baby
And now you wanna run away from old B too
You know I loved you baby
