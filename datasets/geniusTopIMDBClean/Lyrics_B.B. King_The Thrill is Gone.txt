The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And youll be sorry someday
The thrill is gone
Its gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although Ill still live on
But so lonely Ill be
The thrill is gone
Its gone away for good
Oh the thrill is gone baby
Its gone away for good
Someday I know Ill be over it all baby
Just like I know a man should
You know Im free free now baby
Im free from your spell
Im free free free now
Im free from your spell
And now that its all over
All I can do is wish you well
