There is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind baby
By the way you look at me
And what youre thinking brings happiness
Oh and it brings misery
Please please dont try to tell me
I think I I understand
No no dont try to tell me baby
Cause I think I I understand
You want me to try and forget you
Well Ill do
Baby Ill do the best I can
You know it hurts you when youre in love with someone and you know that someone dont love you It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know that the someone that youre in love with is in love with your best friend And Ill tell you when someone else is rocking your rocking your cradle you know better than you can rock your cradle yourself then theres only one thing for you to do
You just pack your clothes turn around and slowly walk out of the door
Look over your left shoulder as you go out then you hang your head and you say
Oh please dont try to tell me
Uhhuh I think I understand
No no no no
Please dont try to tell me
Because you think you think I understand
Oh you want me to try
To try to forget you baby
And Ill tell you Ill do the best I can
You know after you have done all you could do and you cant take no more then you go downtown you get your big baseball bat and you come back on the scene where they both are still together and then you just go and kick down the door Now as you kick down the door you just start beating the hell of everybody that you can see everybody that comes through the door and just as you make up your mind that youre gonna try to forgive her then out comes another one of your friends and that really blows your mind So you go and think about you say to yourself Baby I realize Ive done wrong but please forgive me And with a smirky smile on her face then she look up at you and she say
If you ever think about me
Oh I think about you baby 
If you ever charge your mind
Oh youre staying on my mind baby 
If you ever think about me
Oh I think I think about you all the time 
And if I ever cross your mind
You stayed on my mind 
Well you know you know you know Im yours
And I know I know you got to be mine
Yeah
