Well now its three oclock in the morning
And I cant even close my eyes
Three oclock in the morning baby
And I cant even close my eyes
Cant find my baby
And I cant be satisfied
Ive looked around me
And my baby she cant be found
Ive looked all around me people
And my baby she cant be found
You know if I dont find my baby
Im going down to the Golden Ground
Thats where the men hang out
Goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins
