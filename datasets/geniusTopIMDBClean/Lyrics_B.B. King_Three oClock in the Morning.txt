Thank you so much we thank you
Thank you ladies and gentlemen
Right here were going all back to the begun
All we go to the very beginnin
Before we made this and very few people knew about BB King
We go all back this time
You remind and go back one time do you
Sometimes you feel good go back and start all over again
Oh boy
You show so good to me I will tell that
That you are
Now here it is three oclock in the morning
Oh cant even close my eyes
Oh yes
Its three oclock in the morning baby
Oh I cant even close my eyes
Well you know I cant find my baby
Keep on lookin be satisfied
Ive looked around me people
Hey and my baby she knows she cant be found
Looked all around me people
Oh my baby she cant be found
Well you know if I dont find my baby
People Im going down to the Golden Ground
Thats where the fellows hang out down there
They shoot pool you know
Goodbye everybody
Oh I do believe this is the end
Oh oh goodbye everybody
Oh I do believe that this is the end
Oh I want you to tell my baby
Oh to forgive me for my sins
A guy feels lonely then when you hear something like that
You cant do whatever you wanna do
Because your mind is on the person you know
You figure something youve done
You dont know what it is because she wont tell you
But every time you look at her she just starts to crying and wont say nothing
Then you say to yourself
Its my own fault baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Oh yes my own fault baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Because when you would love me baby
Oh a good time looked down
That wouldnt be true
I go up on my feet and I had a lot of friends
Now bad luck has hit me people
And now Im down again
Oh I wonder why
Why does everything have to happen to me
Im blue and Im lonesome people
My heart is filled with misery
Once I had a lotta money
They say the greatest man until
But bad luck has hit me now
Pain has got me down
Yes I wonder why people
Why does everything have to happen to me
I say Im blue and Im lonesome people
My heart is filled with misery
