To know you is to love you
But to know me is not that way you see
Cause you made me so happy
That my love for you grows endlessly
When Im down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When Im down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
Baby to know you is to love you
You smile when I see your face
Cause there aint no one on this earth
Baby could ever ever take your place
When Im down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When Im down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
Oh oh to know you is to love you
Is to see you being free as the wind
Cause the power of your loving
Is too strong to hold within
To know you is to love you
To see you blowing free in the breeze
The power of your loving
I never found a woman like you
That could be my lover
And my best friend
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and cant you feel our love
Just growing growing growing
Growing growing growing
Hey I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and cant you feel our love
Just growing growing growing
Growing growing doggone it baby
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and cant you feel our love
Just growing growing growing
Growing growing hey doggone it baby
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
And I think you love me too
Mmm baby I know you
