To Know You Is to Love You Lyrics
To know you is to love you
But to know me is not that way, you see
'Cause you made me so happy
That my love for you grows endlessly

When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
Baby, to know you is to love you
You smile when I see your face
'Cause there ain't no one on this earth
Baby, could ever, ever take your place


When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me

Oh, oh, to know you is to love you
Is to see you being free as the wind
'Cause the power of your loving
Is too strong to hold within
To know you is to love you
To see you blowing free in the breeze
The power of your loving
I never found a woman like you
That could be my lover
And my best friend
You might also like

I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, growing
Hey, I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, doggone it, baby
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, hey, doggone it, baby
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
And I think you love me, too
Mmm baby, I know you
