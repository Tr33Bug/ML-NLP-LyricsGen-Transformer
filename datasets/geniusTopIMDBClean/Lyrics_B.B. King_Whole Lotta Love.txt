I got a whole lot of lovin
Baby just waiting for you
I got a whole lot of lovin
Baby just waiting for you
And the way I could love you woman
Honey I know you could love me too
Oh youre so good lookin baby
And you build up from the ground
Well youre so good lookin baby
And you build up from the ground
Every time I see you baby
My love starts tumbling down
Yeah youre just my type baby
Just my height and size
Said youre just my type baby
Youre just my height and size
And the reason I love you
Because youve got those little dreamy eyes
