Everybody wants to know
Why I sing the blues
Yes I say everybody wanna know
Why I sing the blues
Well Ive been around a long time
I really have paid my dues
When I first got the blues
They brought me over on a ship
Men were standing over me
And a lot more with a whip
And everybody wanna know
Why I sing the blues
Well Ive been around a long time
Mm Ive really paid my dues
Ive laid in a ghetto flat
Cold and numb
I heard the rats tell the bedbugs
To give the roaches some
Everybody wanna know
Why Im singing the blues
Yes Ive been around a long time
People Ive paid my dues
I stood in line
Down at the County Hall
I heard a man say Were gonna build
Some new apartments for yall
And everybody wanna know
Yes they wanna know
Why Im singing the blues
Yes Ive been around a long long time
Yes Ive really really paid my dues
Now Im gonna play Lucille
My kids gonna grow up
Gonna grow up to be a fool
Cause they aint got no more room
No more room for him in school
And everybody wanna know
Everybody wanna know
Why Im singing the blues
I say Ive been around a long time
Yes Ive really paid some dues
Yeah you know the company told me
Guess youre born to lose
Everybody around me people
It seems like everybody got the blues
But I had em a long time
Ive really really paid my dues
You know I aint ashamed of it people
I just love to sing my blues
I walk through the cities people
On my bare feet
I had a fill of catfish and chitterlings
Up in Downbill Street
You know Im singing the blues
Yes I really
I just have to sing my blues
Ive been around a long time
People Ive really really paid my dues
Now Father Time is catching up with me
Gone is my youth
I look in the mirror everyday
And let it tell me the truth
Im singing the blues
Mm I just have to sing the blues
Ive been around a long time
Yes yes Ive really paid some dues
Yeah they told me everything
Would be better out in the country
Everything was fine
I caught me a bus uptown baby
And every people all the people
Got the same trouble as mine
I got the blues huh huh
I say Ive been around a long time
Ive really paid some dues
One more time fellows
Blind man on the corner
Begging for a dime
The rollers come and caught him
And throw him in the jail for a crime
I got the blues
Mm Im singing my blues
Ive been around a long time
Mm Ive really paid some dues
Can we do just one more
Oh I thought Id go down to the welfare
To get myself some grits and stuff
But a lady stand up and she said
You havent been around long enough
Thats why I got the blues
Mm the blues
I say Ive been around a long time
Ive really really paid my dues
Fellows tell them one more time
Ha ha ha Thats all right fellows
