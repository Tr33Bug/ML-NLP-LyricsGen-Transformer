Worry worry worry
Worry is all I can do
Oh worry worry worry baby
Worry is all I can do
Oh my life is so miserable baby
Baby and its all on account of you
You hurt me so bad baby
When you said we were through
Oh you hurt me
You know you hurt me so bad baby
When you said we were through
Oh but I would rather be dead baby
Then to be here so alone and blue
Someday baby
Oh someday baby
Oh someday baby
Oh oh oh oh yes
Oh someday baby
Yes someday baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
Someday baby
When the blood runs cold in my veins
You know you wont be able to hurt me no more baby
Cause my heart wont feel no pain
Ladies I said Ladies Ladies if you got a man and the man dont do like you think he should ladies you dont hurt im I said you dont hurt him Men happens to be Gods gift to women So ladies you must know that the man is already grown so you cant raise him over again
So the thing to do is throw your arms around him Hold him close to you Look him straight in the eyes And then you tell him you tell him you say Now baby you been messing up but I know you gonna do me better and when he look at you as if he wanna know when then you tell himsomeday baby and if it seem like hes hard of hearing or not paying you much attention or something do like you ladies are known to do Put your hands on your hips and then you say it again Ow He has to be a mighty hard hearted person not to listen to you
But I dont think its fair to just talk to the ladies I think I should say a few words to the men too So fellas I said Fellas Fellas if you got a woman and the lady dont do like you think she should dont you be goin upside of her head now you know what im talkin about dont you be beatin on her The judgements much cheaper if you dont beat her and you see if you hurt her you only do one thing I said if youhurt her you only do one thing you make her a little smarter and she wont let you catch her the next time so the thing to do is throw your arms around the pretty little thing Now listen to me listen to me I dont care if she weigh thirtytwo and a half pounds wet or five hundred and fifty pounds on her feet If shes your lady and you dig her than shes your pretty little thing and then you tell her You say Baby Baby I dont care what they say about you on the next block your my little lady and I dig you let em talk let em say what they want to say
And fellas you must know too that the ladies god bless their sweet little souls ladies happens to be Gods gift to man too fellas You all agreed You better say it cause your wife is listening But theres just one more thing I must say to you fellas Just one more thing Dont be too proud to beg I said dont be too proud to beg If you have to fall down on your knees to let your woman know that you love her go on down there I can see some of you cats got dirty minds in the place this eveningwhat im tryin to say ladies love to hear their men say Baby I love you dont you ladies I said ladies Love to hear their men say Baby I love you
Dont you ladies So fellas tell your lady that you love her She might think youre lying though Tell your lady that you love her even if you are lying
But seriously speaking when I goof when I goof I usually slide up to my woman and i look straight at her I have to get my look first I usually say I look like a little puppy begging for that last bone you been holding out on I look straight at her and I say Baby Please forgive me honey And then i wait a few minutes to see how she take it and then I say Baby Please forgive me honey and then I stand back far enough so that when she swings I can duck and then I say Baby You know when I goofed last week I was high If she let me get away with that then I look at her real pitifull like this Say Baby Honey you know when youre high it dont count And then I tell her I say If you forgive me honey Im gonna do better And if she look at me as if she wanna know when then I tell her someday baby
