You Upset Me Baby LyricsYes she's 36 in the bust
28 in the waist, 44 in the hips
She got a real crazy legs
You upsets me baby
Yes you upsets me baby

Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman what you do to me
Well, she's not too tall, complexion is fair
Man she knocks me out the way she wears her hair
You upsets me baby
Yes you upsets me baby
Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman, woman what you do to me
Well, I try to describe her, it's hard to stop
I better stop now because I got a weak heart
You upsets me
Well you upsets me baby

Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman what you do to me
Well, I try to describe her, it's hard to stop
I better stop now because I got a very weak heart
You upsets me baby
Yes you upsets me baby

Well I like being hit by a ball and tree
Woman what you do to meYou might also like1Embed
