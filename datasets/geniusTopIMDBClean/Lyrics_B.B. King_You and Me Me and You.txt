You took me way back in the country
You fed me on love and greens
You laid my head upon a feather bed
And I sure had some mighty sweet dreams
Dont you know we got something going on
You and me me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me Ill sing to you
It goes ooh 
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh 
Thats the way our love song goes
Mornings come easy in the country
Never had this feeling before
Ever since you found me
Love has been around me
And Ill never be lonely no more
Dont you know we got something going on
You and me me and you
Love can be a song if you like the tune
So sing to me Ill sing to you
It goes ooh 
Just let the feelings flow
It goes ooh 
Thats the way our love song goes
