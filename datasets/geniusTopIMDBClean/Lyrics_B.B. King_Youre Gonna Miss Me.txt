Let me tell you people a low down thing or two
I just cant stand that old evil way she do
She gonna miss me yeah youre gonna miss me
Youre gonna miss me baby when Im dead and gone
Came home this mornin she wouldnt let me in
She said Go away baby I got too many friends
Youre gonna miss me yeah youre gonna miss me
Youre gonna miss me baby when Im dead and gone
Hard to love a woman when the woman dont love you
Shell treat you so low down n dirty till you wont know what to do
Youre gonna miss me hey youre gonna miss me baby
Youre gonna miss me woman when Im dead and gone
Well byebye baby I hope we meet again
You wont be so evil when you wont have too many men
Youre gonna miss me baby yeah youre gonna miss me
Yeah youre gonna miss me woman when Im dead and gone
