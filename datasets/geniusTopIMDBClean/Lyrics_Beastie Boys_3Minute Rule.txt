I stay up all night I go to sleep watching Dragnet
Never sleep alone because Jimmy is the magnet
Im so rope they call me Mr Roper
When the troubles arise you know Im the cool coper
On the mic I score just like the Yankees
Get over on Miss Crabtree like my main man Spankee
Excuse me young lady I dont mean to trouble ya
But youre lookin so fly inside your BMW
I got lucky I brought home the kitten
Before I got busy I slipped on the mitten
Cant get better odds because Im a sure thing
Proud Mary keeps on turning and rolling like a RingDing
Jump the turnstiles never pay the toll
Doowah diddy and bust in with the preroll
Customs jailed me over an herb seed
Dont rat on your boy over some rat weed
Im outta your back door Im into another
Your boyfriend doesnt know about me and your mother
Not perfect grammar always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D is for diamonds
Roses are red the sky is blue
I got my barrel at your neck so what the fuck you gonna do
Its just two wheels and me the wind in my eyes
The engine is the music and my nines by my side
Cause you know YAUCH
Im taking all emcees out in the place
Takin life as it comes no fool am I
Im goin off gettin paid and I dont ask why
Playin beats on my box makin music for the many
Know a lot of def girls thatll do anything
A lot of parents like to think Im a villain
Im just chillin like Bob Dylan
Yeah I smoke cheeba it helps me with my brain
I might be a little dusted but Im not insane
People come up to me and they try to talk shit
Man I was making records when you were suckin your mothers dick
Girl youre walking tall now in your fancy clothes
You got fancy things theyre going up your nose
Youre getting fancy gifts from expensive men
Youre a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen
Mothership connection getting girls affection
If your life needs correction dont follow my direction
You got your 8 by 10 your agent your Harley
You be driving around Hollywood with yo Sorry Charlie
Cause Im running things like some mack motherfucker
You slipin you slackin cause youre a false fake sucker
You slip you slack you clock me and you lack
While Im reading On The Road by my man Jack Kerouac
Poetry in motion coconut lotion
Had to diss the girl because she got too emotional
Are you experienced little girl
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
Cause Im on your mind its hard to forget me
Ill take your pride for a ride if you let me
So peace out yall a PCP song out
Full throttle to the bottle and full full clout
And Im out
