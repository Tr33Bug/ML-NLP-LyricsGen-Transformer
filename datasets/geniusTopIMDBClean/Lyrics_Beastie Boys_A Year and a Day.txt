M C for what I am and do
The A is for Adam and the lyrics true
So as I pray and hope that the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because Im down with the three the unstoppable three
Me and Adam and D were born to emcee
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you recited
Arrested bailed but cuffed and indicted
Enter the arena as I take the center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the Ed is Special
For I am the Bard and I am the last one
I am the king and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I dont think its gonna last
And you can bet your ass
I drop the L when Im skiin
Im smokin and peakin
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Cant stop the mindfuck when its rollin along
Cant stop the smooth running when the shits running strong
Broke my bindings the lion with wings
Preaching his words in the bboy sing
I am one with myself as I turn to thee
Prefer the dreams to the reality
I prefer my life dont need no other mans wife
Dont need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But its good to have a turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week or for a year or for a year and a day
Come what may
Im fishin in my boat and Im fishing for trout
Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors cause the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day
And Im going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody somewhere is testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages is was and always shall be
