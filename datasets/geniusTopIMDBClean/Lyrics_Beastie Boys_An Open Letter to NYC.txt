Listen All You New Yorkers
Brooklyn Bronx Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian MiddleEastern and Latin
Black White New York you make it happen
Brownstones water towers trees skyscrapers
Writers prize fighters and Wall Street traders
We come together on the subway cars
Diversity unified whoever you are
Were doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the L were doin swell
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
Cause were thorough in the boroughs and thats a must
I remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIXX
At lunch Id go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
Dear New York I hope youre doing well
I know a lots happened and youve been through hell
So we give thanks for providing a home
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves
Brooklyn Bronx Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian MiddleEastern and Latin
Black White New York you make it happen
The LIE the BQE
Hippies at the band shell with the LSD
Get my BVDs from VIM
You know Im reppin Manhattan the best I can
Stopped off at Bleeker Bobs got thrown out
Sneakin in at 400 am after going out
You didnt rob me in the park at Diana Ross
But everybody started looting when the light went off
From the South South Bronx on out to Queensbridge
From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side
From 1010 WINS to Live At Five
Dear New York this is a love letter
To you and how you brought us together
We cant say enough about all you do
Cause in the city were ourselves and electric too
Brooklyn Bronx Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian MiddleEastern and Latin
Black White New York you make it happen

Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from
Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem
To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met
Before they moved on down to the Upper West
I see youre still strong after all thats gone on
Life long we dedicate this song
Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Since 911 were still livin
And lovin life weve been given
Aint nothing gonna take that away from us
Were lookin pretty and gritty cause in the city we trust
Dear New York I know a lot has changed
2 towers down but youre still in the game
Home to the many rejecting no one
Accepting peoples of all places wherever theyre from
Brooklyn Bronx Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian MiddleEastern and Latin
Black White New York you make it happen
