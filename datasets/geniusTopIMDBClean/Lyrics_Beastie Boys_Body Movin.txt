Ready One You will do this four times with the left
Four with the right then eight times with both
Then repeat Ah Clap your hands
Body movin body movin
A1 sound and the sounds so soothing
Body movin body movin
We be getting down and you know were Krush Groovin
Now let me get some action from the back section
We need body rockin not perfection
Let your backbone flip but dont slip a disc
And let your spine unwind  just take a risk
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong
The ship is docking interlockin
And uprockin electroshocking
Were getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
Now all of yall get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with
Body movin body movin
A1 sound and the sounds so soothing
Body movin body movin
We be getting down and you know were Krush Groovin
Flame on Im gone
Im so sweet like a nice bonbon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it til the break of dawn
Puttin bodies in motion cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin you insane
You cant explain to people this type of mind frame
Like a bottle of ChteauneufduPape
Im fine like wine when I start to rap
We need bodyrockin not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section
Body movin body movin
A1 sound and the sounds so soothing
Body movin body movin
We be getting down and you know were Krush Groovin
Mike D with the master plan
I said Ooh mymy and thank you maam
And when I grab the mic you scream Ooh goddamn
The crme de la crme is who I am
MCA where have you been
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
Cause when it comes to quarries Im known to swim
And Adrock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play defender
I could be your hyperspace So
Body movin body movin
A1 sound and the sounds so soothing
Body movin body movin
We be getting down and you know were Krush Groovin
You will do eight hops on the left eight on the right
Four left four right two left two right the one each
Left right left right Start and land on the balls of the feet
Left foot Ready Its one two three four five
