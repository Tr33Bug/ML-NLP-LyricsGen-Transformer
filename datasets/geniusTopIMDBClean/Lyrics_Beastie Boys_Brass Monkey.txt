Got this dance thats more than real
Drink Brass Monkey heres how you feel
You put your left leg down your right leg up
Tilt your head back lets finish the cup
MCA with the bottle D rocks the can
AdRock gets nice with Charlie Chan

Wherever we go we bring the Monkey with us
AdRock drinks three Mike D is D
Double R foots the bill most definitely

Because
Cause I drink it anytime and any place
When its time to get ill I pour it on my face
Monkey tastes def when you pour it on ice
Come on yall its time to get nice
Coolin by the lockers getting kind of funky
Me and the crew were drinking Brass Monkey
This girl walked by she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker grabbed the spanish fly
I put it in the Monkey mixed it in a cup
Went over to the girl Yo baby whats up
I offered her a sip  sip  the girl she gave me lip  lip 
It did begin the stuff wore in and now shes on my tip

Step up to the bar put the girl down
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around
You take a sip you can do it you get right to it
We had a case in the place and we went right through it
You got a dry martini you thinking youre cool
Ill take your place at the bar I smack you off your stool
Ill down a 40 dog in a single gulp
And if you got beef youll get beat to a pulp
Monkey and parties and reelin and rockin
Defdef girlsgirls all yall jockin
The song and dance keeping you in a trance
If you dont buy my record I got my advance
I drink it I think it I see it I be it
I love Brass Monkey but I dont give D it
We got the bottle you got the cup
Come on everybody lets get ffffff
