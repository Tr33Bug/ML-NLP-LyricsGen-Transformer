Some static started in the pool hall
Hit a motherfuckers face with the cue ball
And I met this girl she tried to gank me
So I smacked her in the booty with a plank B
Cause me and my crew were out breaking windows
The bingo the lotto you know Ill never win those
Possession is half the law I had my routines before all yall
Your whole life is coming apart at the seams
You aint nothing but a car thief biting routines
See Im a city slicker I I aint no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie
And like Ricky always said youve got to toke and pass
Or Mookies gonna kick your motherfucking ass
Try to take what isnt yours like a god damn rat
See I personally I wouldnt even wanna go out like that
Im a writer a poet a genius I know it
I dont buy cheeba I grow it  Im a farmer 
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a moneyhungry miser
Had a cainefilled Kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You cant deny me you always want to try me
Yo youre just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
Smoking that dust at St Anthonys Feast
All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rope chain when hes walking the beat
So like a sneaky pouch timebomb ticking
Alike the beat to my rhyme just kicking
Space cake cookies I discover who I am
Im a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man
Fiveoh caught me now Im going to the mountains
Said goodbye to my girl my lawyer and accountants
My mind is kinda rhyming and I think I oughta think
So Im rockin all the rhymes and Ill have another drink
So the lights are flashing my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning of another rhyme
Im rapping emceeing I rock
You aint nothing but a car thief who must be stopped
