Oh whatchyouwhat are you sayin
All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Dont mean to diss dont mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin doors off hinges
Ill grab you with the pinchers
And no I didnt retire
Ill snatch you up with a needle nose pliers
Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat youve never seen before
Glidin in the glades
And like Lorne Greene you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
Im a motherfuckin Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right
Now remain calm no alarm
Cause my farm aint fat
So whats up with that
Ive got friends and family that I respect
When I think Im too good they put me in check
So believe when I say Im no better than you
Except when I rap so I guess it aint true
Like that yall and you just dont stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock
Checkchcheckcheckcheckchcheck it out
Whatwhawhatwhatwhats it all about
Workwaworkworkworkwawork it out
Lets turn this muthafucking party out
I said Doc whats the condition
Im a man thats on a mission
He said Son youd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician
Like a scientist
Mmm when Im applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined
Now hey baby bubba now whats the deal
I didnt know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi some hot potato
I stole your mic but you wont see it later
Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up the mathematician
Im a bank cashier engineer
I wear cotton and I dont wear sheer
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip Im gonna cruise past ya
Yo money dont chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing youre out of phase and my crews amazing
Were working on the record yo so just stay patient

Now I go by the name of the King AdRock
I dont wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit thats beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy  Who moi 
I am the one with the clientele
You say AdRock you rock so well
Ive got class like pink champale
MCA grab the mic before the mic goes stale
Dont test me they cant arrest me
Ill fake right crossover and shoot lefty
You look upset yo calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what youre making aint hiphop B
Now
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin out set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say those were the days
Now checkchcheckcheckcheckchcheck it out
