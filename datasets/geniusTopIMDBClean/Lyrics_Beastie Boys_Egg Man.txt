Ahh yeah
I looked out the window seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes he had no hair
Launched that shot and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the slingshot let one fly
He went for his to find he didnt have one
Put him in check correct with my egggun
The egg a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy he thought it was a joke
The trigger I pulled  his face the yolk
Reached in his pocket took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers they come a dime a dozen
When I say dozen you know what Im talkin about boy
Yeah thats right Im the Egg Man
Driving around king of the town  yeah 
Always got my windows rolled down
Ready to throw
You know Im the Egg Man
Once upon a time  Egg Man 
Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall then he broke his leg
Tossed it out the window three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman he said  Bloodclot 
Which came first the chicken or the egg
I egged the chicken and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains in between cars
When I pull out the station Youre Gonna Get Yours
Driveby eggings plaguing LA
Yo you just got my little cousin ese
Sometimes hardboiled sometimes runny  Ray 
Comes from a chicken not a bunny dummy
People laugh its no joke
My names Yauch and Im throwing the yolk
Now they got me in a cell but I dont care
It was then that I got caught catching people out there
Up on the roof in my car up all night
Im going through science like Dolemite
The Mack  Who 
Im the Egg Man Taxi driver
Im the Egg Man
Egg Man Egg Man
We all dressed in black we snuck up around the back
We began to attack the eggs did crack on Hazes back
Sam I Am down with the program
Green Eggs and Ham Yosemite Sam
Come Halloween you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker kpap
You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Woke up in the morning peculiar feeling
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
The family punk rocks the businessman
Ill dog everybody with the egg in my hand
Its not like the crack that you put in a pipe
But crack on your forehead heres a towel now wipe
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man Egg Man
Egg Man
