Yeah
Kick it
You wake up late for school man you dont wanna go
You ask your mom Please but she still says No
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like youre some kind of jerk
You gotta fight
For your right
To party
Your pop caught you smoking and he said No way
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag  Busted 
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight
Dont step out of this house if thats the clothes youre gonna wear
Ill kick you out of my home if you dont cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said Whats that noise
Aw Mom youre just jealous its the Beastie Boys
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party
Party
Party
