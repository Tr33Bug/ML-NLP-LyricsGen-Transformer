Girls
All I really want is  Girls 
And in the morning its  Girls 
Cause in the evening its  Girls 
I like the way that they walk
And its chill to hear them talk
And I can always make em smile
From White Castle to the Nile
Back in the day  bom bom bombom bombom bom bom bombom 
There was this girl around the way  bom bom bombom bombom bom bom bombom 
She liked my homepiece MCA  bom bom bombom bombom bom bom bombom
