Good times gone and you missed them
Whats gone wrong in your system
Things they bounce like a Spalding
Whatd you think Did you miss your calling
Its so free this kind of feeling
Its like life its so appealing
When youve got so much to say
Its called gratitude and thats right
Good times gone but you feed it
Hates grown strong you feel you need it
Just one thing do you know you
What you think That the world owes you
Whats gonna set you free
Look inside and youll see
When youve got so much to say
Its called gratitude and thats right
