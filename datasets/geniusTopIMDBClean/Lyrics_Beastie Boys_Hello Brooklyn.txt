Hello Brooklyn
New York New York  its a hell of a town
You know The Bronx is up and Im Brooklyn down
Because they dont know my name  only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job I cut my hair
You know I cut my boss because I dont care
You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle
Youre gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
Cause being as fly as me is something that you never thought of
Youll be stickin up old ladies with the handgun or the sawedoff
Im a buffalo soldier broader than Broadway
Keep keepin on I dont care what they say
I play my stereo loud I disturb my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
Cause I am the holder of the threepack bonanza
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the threepack bonanza
If you ask a question then you shall get the answer
Her breast I saw I reached I felt
M ON EY the belt
I stay at home just like a hermit
I got the jammy but I dont got the permit  you know why 
You got a boyfriend and his name is Nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick
I ride around town cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in Brooklyn  just to watch him die
