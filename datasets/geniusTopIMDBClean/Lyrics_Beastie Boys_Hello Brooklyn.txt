Hello Brooklyn LyricsHello Brooklyn!
New York, New York - it's a hell of a town
You know The Bronx is up, and I'm Brooklyn down
Because they don't know my name - only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job, I cut my hair
You know, I cut my boss because I don't care
You tried to get slick, you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
'Cause being as fly as me is something that you never thought of
You'll be stickin' up old ladies with the handgun or the sawed-off
I'm a buffalo soldier, broader than Broadway
Keep keepin' on, I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud, I disturb my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
'Cause I am the holder of the three-pack bonanza
If you open the book, then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the three-pack bonanza
If you ask a question, then you shall get the answer
Her breast, I saw, I reached, I felt
M, O-N, E-Y, the belt
I stay at home, just like a hermit
I got the jammy, but I don't got the permit (you know why)
You got a boyfriend, and his name is Nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick
I ride around town 'cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in Brooklyn ("just to watch him die")You might also like2Embed
