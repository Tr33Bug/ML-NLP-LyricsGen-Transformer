Uh thank you ladies and gentlemen this next song is a blast
And I gotta say we are having a ball up here tonight
And when youre ready and
Shabba doo shabba dee
Shabba dee shabba doo
Which of you schnooks took my rhyme book
Look give it back youre wickywack
With your tickytack calls didnt touch you at all
I didnt touch your hand man you know its all ball
You sold a few records but dont get slick
Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits
Yeah youve been in the game your career is long
But when you really break it down you only got two songs
MCs are like clay pigeons when Im shootin skeet
I just yell Pull and Mike drops the beat
You people call yourselves MCs but youre garbage men
Takin out the trash when you pull out the pen
And if you dont like it then hey fuck you
Now I read about you up on page 6
They was trashin your ass it said youre gettin dissed
Now talk about your face now dont get pissed
But I suggest you see a dermatologist
I keep that hot sauce hot not mild and weak
Its gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak
Ive got billions and billions of rhymes to flex
Cause Ive got more rhymes than Carl Sagans got turtlenecks
Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch
Youre hearing me and youre like Oh my god its Sasquatch
But Im walkin on water while youre steppin in shit
So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit
And if you dont like it then hey fuck you
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
And if you dont like it then hey fuck you
Sucker MCs its me theyre resentin
In the animal kingdom they call it presentin
With the dipsydoodle the kit and caboodle
The truth is brutal your grandmas kugel
Kings County is my stomping ground
The Albee Square Mall Brooklyn Downtown
So dont ask me to wine and dine ya
Im from Brooklyn youre from Regina
Youre like Foghorn Leghorn Yosemite Sam
Youre just yellin and wildin wonderin who I am
Awith those lies youre telling youre like Toucan Sam
But my styles impregnable like the Hoover Dam
And if you dont like it then hey fuck you
And if you dont like it then hey fuck you
Whow what a loser
