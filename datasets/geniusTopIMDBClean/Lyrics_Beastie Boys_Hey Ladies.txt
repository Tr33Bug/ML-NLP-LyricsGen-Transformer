Hey  Hey ladies in the place Im callin out to ya
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
Theres more to me than youll ever know
And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery
Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words flowin out just like the Grand Canyon
And Im always out lookin for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on the bib
Wheelin and dealin I make a little bit of a stealin
Ill bring you back to the place and your dress Im peelin
Your bodys on time and your mind is appealin
Starin at the cracks up there up on the ceilin
Such and such will be the bass that Im throwin
Im talking to a girl telling her Im allknowing
Well shes talking to the kid  Who to the kid 
Im telling her every lie that you know that I never did
Hey ladies get funky
All the ladies in the house
The ladies the ladies
Well me in the corner with a goodlookin daughter
I dropped my drawers and said Welcome back Kotter
We was cuttin up the rug she started cuttin up the carpet
In my apartment I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl aint nothin but a crab
Educated no stupid yep
And when I say stupid I mean stupid fresh
Im not James At 15 or Chachi in charge
Im Adam and Im adamant about livin large
With the white Sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the booty
Cause I dont kinda go for that messin around
You be listenin to my records a number one sound
Step step to the rhythm step step to the rhyme
Ive got an open mind so why dont you all get inside
Tune in turn on to my tune thats live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive
Hey ladies get funky
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Girls girls
Hey hey hey hey ladies
One more time aint it funky now
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey ladies
Aint it funky now  You know that 
Shes got a gold tooth you know shes hardcore
Shell show you a good time then shell show you the door
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent van Gogh go and mail that ear
I call her in the middle of the night when Im drinkin
The phone booth on the corner is damp and its stinkin
She said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train
Well take my advice at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak man
Suckin down pints til I didnt know
Woke up in the morning with the Won Ton Ho
Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walkin high and mighty like shes number one
She thinks shes the passionate one
Hey ladies get funky
Whats that
Good god
Good god dance
Good god
Baby baby baby baby
Aint it funky brother
He ha ha ha
Hey hey hey hey ladies
Hey hey ladies
