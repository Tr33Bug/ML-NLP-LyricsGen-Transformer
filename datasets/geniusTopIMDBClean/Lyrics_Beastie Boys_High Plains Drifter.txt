Cause Im the high plains drifter and Im the drifter
The high plains drifter and Im the drifter
They cant catch me theyre never going to find me
Theyre never gonna know that Im the high plains drifter
Pulled over to the river to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers pulled a bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing cross the country listenin to my 8track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
Im longdistance from my girl and Im talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were
Check the rear view mirror check the gold tooth display
Check the odometer and I was on my way
Cause Im the high plains drifter the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that Im getting pushed
Dont step to me cause you could be getting mushed
Im doing 120 plowing over mailboxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel 6
Its five dollars extra to get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
Im a kleptomaniac Kmart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside and the engine still revving
Takin care of business at 7Eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price
So I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice
Cause Im molello like yolello cool like lemonade
I made my getaway and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen a former movie star
Looked in the rear view mirror seen the police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldnt help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash but my gun I did carry
Im seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window and said Boy wheres the fire
You got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
Outta the car longhair Your goose is cooked
Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked


Making like a DT driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hats my home and my past is kind of blurry
Every dog will have his day mine will be in front of a jury
High plains drifter you know that Im never in a hurry
Read me my rights as if I didnt know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his 5 oclock shadow he smelled of 3day old beer
My man turned to me and said Why are you here
I said Im charming Im dashing Im rentalcar bashing
Im phonypaper passing at Nix Check Cashing
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D
He said You behave or well throw away the key
Houdinid out the cuffs kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiffs wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling easy come easy go
I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show
And sure enough that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hotwired hot wheeled and Suzy is a headbanger
