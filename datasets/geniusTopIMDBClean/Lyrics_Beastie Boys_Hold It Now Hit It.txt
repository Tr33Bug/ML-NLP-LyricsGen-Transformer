Hold it now hit it
Yo Leroy
Ahh yeah yeah yeah
Why dont you hook up that def jam right about now
Now I chill real ill when I start to chill
When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills
Sipping pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill Im chillychill
Now I just got home because Im out on bail
Whats the time Its time to buy ale
Peter eater parking meter all of the time
If I run out of ale its Thunderbird wine
Millerdrinking chickeneating dress so fly
I got friends in high places that are keeping me high
Get down with Mike D and it aint no hassle
I got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle
Hold it now hit it
Yo Leroy
Its my drum its my hold it now its my rhyme
And now its me Adam Yauch in the place to be
All the girls are on me cause Im down with Mike D
Im down with Mike D and it aint no baloney
For real not phony OE and RiceaRoni
I come out at night cause I sleep all day
Well Im the King AdRock and hes MCA
Well Im cruisin Im bruisin Im never ever losing
Im in my car Im going far and dust is what Im using
Around the way is where Im from
And Im from Manhattan and Im not a bum
Because youre pudslapping ballflapping got that juice
My names Mike D and I can do that Jerry Lewis
Hold it now hit it
Yo Leroy
Yo that was real def man try that again man

Hiphoppin body rockin doin the do
Beer drinking breath stinking sniffing glue
Belly fillin always illin bustin caps
My names Mike D and I write my own snaps

Im a killer at large and Im on the loose
Pistol packing Monkey drinking no money bum
I come from Brooklyn cause thats where Im from
Cheapskatin perpetrating moneyhungry jerk
Every day I drink OE and I dont go to work
You drippynose knucklehead youre wet behind the ears
You like men and we like beer
Hold it now hit it
Yo Leroy
Bust that chocolotto
What huh yo man pass that over here man all right
King of the Ave with the def female
Youre rhymin and stealin with the freshest ale
Kid cooling at the crib watching my TV
Ed Norton Ted Knight and Mr ED
Pump it up homeboy just dont stop
Chef Boyardee cooling on the pot
I take no slack cause I got the knack
Im never dusting out cause I tossed that crack
The King AdRock that is my name
Yall drinking Moet and we got the champagne
A quarter droppin going shoppin buyin wigs
Surgeon general cut professor DJ Thigs
Hold it now hit it
Hit it
Hold it now hit it
Yo Leroy
