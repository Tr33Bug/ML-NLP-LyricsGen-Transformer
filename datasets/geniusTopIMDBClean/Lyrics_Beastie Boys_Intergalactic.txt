Well now dont you tell me to smile
You stick around Ill make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe its because Im so versatile
Style profile
I said it always brings me back when I hear Ooh child
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathons til the very last mile
Well if you battle me I will revile
People always saying my style is wild
Youve got gall youve got guile  Guile 
To step to me Im a rapophile
If you wanna battle youre in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile

Jazz and AWOL thats our team
Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats well Im a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
Well I gotta keep it going keep it going full steam
Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean
Well on the tough guy style Im not too keen
Trying to change the world I will plot and scheme
Mario C likes to keep it clean  Clean 
Goin to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rapping cause thats my dream
Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Now when it comes to envy yall is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine  tine 
Another dimension new galaxy

Were from the family tree of old school hiphop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
Cause the music is live like an electric shock
I am known to do the wop  Wop 
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop  Crop 
Beastie Boys known to let the beat
MMM Drrrop
Do it
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If my raps soup my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
Im the lumberjack DJ Adrock
If you try to knock me youll get mocked
Ill stir fry you in my wok
Your kneesll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr Spock
