Oh wine cooler
Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop
I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch
Hes even more over than my mayor Ed Koch
Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four
Cause he aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more
Livin on borrowed time and borrowed money
Sleepin in the street there aint a damn thing funny
With the handmedown food and the handmedown clothes
A rockabilly past of which nobody knows
Makes his home all over the place
He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
Sometimes drunk and hes always phoneless
Sleepin on the street in a cardboard box
Hes better off drinkin than smokin the rocks  Well 
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
Kickin uptown kickin downtown kickin crosstown
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
He drinks where he lies hes covered with flies
Hes got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes
Well you go upstate and you get your head together
Thunderbird is the word and youre light as a feather
Detox at the flop house no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where hes from  in Tennessee 
He lives in the street but hes no bum
Hes a rockabilly star from the days of old
He used to have teeth all filled with gold
He got a platinum voice but only gold records
On the bass was Boots and on the drums was Checkers
Louis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar
Johnny Ryall who do you think you are
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
Drinkin Night Train drinkin OE
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall

Donald Trump and Donald Tramp living in the mens Shelter
Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter
He asks for a dollar you know what its for
Man bottle after bottle he always needs more
Hes no less important than you working class stiffs
He drinks a lot of liquor but he dont drink piss
He paid his dues playing the blues
He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes
Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army
Thats right yall his name is Johnny kick it
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
Johnny Ryall Johnny Rya
