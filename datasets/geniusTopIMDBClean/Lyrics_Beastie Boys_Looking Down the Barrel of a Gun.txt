Im rolling down the hill snowballing getting bigger
An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger
I seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill out
He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout
24 is my age and 22 is my gauge
Im writing rhymes on a page Im goin off in a rage
Cause Im out on a mission a stolen car mission
Had a small problem with the transmission
Three on the tree in the middle of the night
I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight
Life comes in phases take the good with the bad
You bought the coins on the street  Holmes  and you know you got had
Because its all high spirit you know you got to hear it
Dont touch the mic baby dont come near it
Its gonna get you its gonna get you
Its gonna get you girl its gonna get you
Looking down the barrel of a gun
Son of a gun son of a bitch
Getting paid getting rich
Ultra violence be running through my head
Cold medina yall makin me see red
Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets
Ima die harder like my kid Bruce Willis
I love girlies waxing and milking
Coordinating trim is my man Dave Scilken
Predetermined destiny is who I am
You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am
Like Clockwork Orange going off on the town
Ive got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down
Well Im mad at my desk and Ill be writing all curse words
Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words
Youre a headless chicken chasin a sucker freebasin
Youre looking for a fist to put your face in
Well get hip get hip dont slip ya knuckle heads
Racism is schism on a serious tip
