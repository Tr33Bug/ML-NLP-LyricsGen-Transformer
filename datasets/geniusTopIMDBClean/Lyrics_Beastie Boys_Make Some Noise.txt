Yeah get up
Yeah
Uh
Yes here we go again give you more nothing lesser
Back on the mic its the antidepressor
AdRockno pressureyes we need this
The best is yet to come and yes believe this
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip on Prosecco dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number ask Mike Dino
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes they age like wine as I get older
Im getting bolder competition is wanin
I got the ball and I see the lane and
We got a party on the left a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if youre with me
You gotta make some noise if youre with me
Crazy crazy crazy
Armed insurrection popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection
Im like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a FizzyLifting Drink and you got lifted
And sifted Im just riffing
And when I catch MCs its time for wing clipping
I fly like a hawk or better yet an eagle
A seagull I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
Cause Im about the best and if you fess well thats wrong
We got a
We got a party on the left a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if youre with me
You gotta make some noise if youre with me
Crazy crazy crazy
The break is crazy
Crazycrazy


Pass me the scalpel Ill make an incision
Ill cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say Thats my old self
Cant do me nothing cant tell me nada
Dont bug me now because Im doing the lambada  bada 
The forbidden dance  wha  heres my chance
To make romance in my Bboy stance
Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in but they never check out
I set the record straight no doubt
We got a
We got a party on the left a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if youre with me
You gotta make some noise if youre with me
