Michelleâ€™s Farm LyricsYee-haw!
Oh, shut up, you pig fucker
You're so ugly
You're like a zebra, Adam
You're so ugly
You're a ponyass motherfucker
Why don't you get a haircut, farm boy?
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
If you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Farmer Joe fucks a cow
He likes it so much, he sucks a sow
Now you
Everyday I'm going to school
I wish I could be satisfied
But it's hogwash
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard Bob mows the field
Sees how much wheat will yield
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
If you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
And everyday I'm going to school
I wish that I could find gratitude
But it's hogwash
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Barnyard stoats raid the pen
If you don't shoot 'em, they'll do it again
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
Now fuck the chickens, I don't like milk
You might also likeNow me
Everyday I'm riding to school
I'm learning a bunch of brainwash
It's hogwashEmbed
