No sleep till
Brooklyn
Foot on the pedal never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job aint a job its a damn good time
City to city Im running my rhymes
On location touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because Im illing and able
Aint no faking your money Im taking
Going coast to coast watch all the girlies shaking
While youre at the job working ninetofive
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live
No sleep till
Another plane another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl another fight
Another drive all night
Our managers crazy he always smokes dust
Hes got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel girls on the jock
Were trashing hotels like its going out of style
Getting paid along the way cause its worth your while
Four on the floor AdRocks out the door
MCAs in the back cause hes skeezing with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyns in the back
White boys got more rhymes
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn
Aint seen the light since we started this band
So MCA get on the mic my man


Born and bred in Brooklyn USA
They call me Adam Yauch but Im MCA
Like a lemon to a lime a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos arenas and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off Holmes get out of my way
Taxing little girlies from here to LA
Waking up before I get to sleep
Cause Ill be rocking this party eight days a week
No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  Brooklyn 
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  yeah 
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  Brooklyn 
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  Brooklyn 
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  Brooklyn 
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  Brooklyn 
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  Brooklyn 
No  no  sleep  sleep  till Brooklyn  Brooklyn
