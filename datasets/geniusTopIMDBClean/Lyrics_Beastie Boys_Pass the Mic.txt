Goodness gracious
If you can feel what Im feeling then its a musical masterpiece
Hear what Im dealing well then thats cool at least
Whats running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk
And this is me yall I emcee yall

And now Id like to pass the mic
To AdRock cmon and do anything you like

A lot of people get jealous theyre talking about me
But thats just cause they havent got a thing to say

So this is what Ive got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
And now Id like to pass the mic to A

Find that I can groove with the beat when I let go
So put your worries on hold
Get up and groove with the rhythm in your soul

To tell the truth I am exactly what I want to be
Now AdRock  Huh  and MCA  Yeah 
Lets rock this joint in the old school way
Well Im on til the crack of dawn
Mowing down emcees like Im mowing a lawn
I go off like nothing can faze me
You think well ever meet Stevie One of these days D
But I can stand my ground and I am down
To wax an emcee who acts like a clown
But for now Id like to ask you how
You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowd
