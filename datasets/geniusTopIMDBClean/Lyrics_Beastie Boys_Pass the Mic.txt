Goodness gracious
If you can feel what Im feeling then its a musical masterpiece
Hear what Im dealing well then thats cool at least
Whats running through my mind comes through in my walk
True feelings are shown from the way that I talk
And this is me yall I emcee yall

So this is what Ive got to say to you all
Be true to yourself and you will never fall
And now Id like to pass the mic to A

Well Im on til the crack of dawn
Mowing down emcees like Im mowing a lawn

You think well ever meet Stevie One of these days D
But I can stand my ground and I am down
To wax an emcee who acts like a clown
But for now Id like to ask you how
You like the feel of the bass in your face in the crowd
