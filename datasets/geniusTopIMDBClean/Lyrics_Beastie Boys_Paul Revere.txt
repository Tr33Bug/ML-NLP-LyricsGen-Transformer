Now heres a little story Ive got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With AdRock MCA  and me  Mike D
Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Riding across the land kicking up sand
Sheriffs posses on my tail cause Im in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is getting hot the beer is getting flat
Looking for a girl I ran into a guy
His name was MCA I said Howdy he said Hi
He told a little story that sounded wellrehearsed
Four days on the run and that hes dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse his throat was dry he asked me for a sip
He said Can I get some I said You cant get none
Had a chance to run pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw I thought Id be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said
Now my name is MCA Ive got a license to kill  yeah 
I think you know what time it is its time to get ill  yeah 
Now what do we have here an outlaw and his beer  uh huh 
I run this land you understand Ive made myself clear
We stepped into the wind he had a gun I had a grin
You think this storys over but its ready to begin
Now I got the gun you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
Its not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said Ill ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriffs after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So Im on the run the cop got my gun
And right about now its time to have some fun
The King AdRock that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for 6 hours then we hit the spot
The beat was abumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said Yippie Yo you know this kid
I said I didnt but I know he did
The kid said  Get ready cause this aint funny
My names Mike D and Im about to get money
Pulled out the jammy  I aimed it at the sky 
He yelled  Stick em up  and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
Im Mike D and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect 
MCA was with it and hes my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
Piano players out the music stopped
His boy had beef and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money  MCA snatched the gold 
I grabbed two girlies and a beer thats cold
