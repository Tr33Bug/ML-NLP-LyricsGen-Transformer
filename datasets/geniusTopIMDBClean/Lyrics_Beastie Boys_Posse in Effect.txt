Yes yes yall  yall  and you dont stop  stop 
Keep it on  on  and stockin the place  yo Yauch 
Well Im MCA I got nothin to prove
Pay attention my intention is to bust a move  what 
I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes  what up 
Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes
Well Im Mike D I got the deuces wild  yeah buddy 
A list of girlies numbers that Ive dialed
I do the Smurf the Popeye and the Jerry Lewis
I like Bullwinkle but I dont like Brutus
Well Im schoolin in the boys room coolin by the locker  well 
All the girls in class knows that Im the cool rocker  uh yeah 
Punk in the hall man I shoulda oughta hit him
Had the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bit em
Smokin in the boys room is what I do best
While you were at a party your girlfriend fessed  Check it 
I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious
Fly around the world but it makes me nauseous
Mike Ds day off every day of the week  ah D 
I got to the party  keep it on  and I did the freak
I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda
You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda
Im a Def Manhattan killer a rhyme thriller
A mic in my hand  bust it  and a mouth full of Miller
I got a hat not a visor I drink Budweiser
The turntables up on the drum riser
The needles in the groove and the vinyls on the platter
I know that Im fly man theres no need to flatter
I travel around the globe its keeping girlies dizzy
My names Mike D so watch me get busy yall
Ggget busy yall
Ggget busy yall
Youre a fake wearin sucker whose gold got rusted
Dusted rusted mustard sgusted
Cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
Mustard mustard mustard mustard
You tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted
Busted busted busted busted
Your crews all soft and Im disgusted
Sgusted sgusted  sgusted
Im from downtown from the city from of Manhattan
I got a lotta girlies and not ones cattin
My posses in effect and were doin the deuce
And we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew
Caught you poppin that weak and you must have been dusted
Dusted dusted dusted
Stuck your head in the toilet and stonecold flushed it
Flushed it flushed it flushed it flushed it
Word
