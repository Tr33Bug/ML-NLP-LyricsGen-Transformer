Yo I dont hang out with those guys man I aint got nothing to do with those dudes
Wait a minute I saw your female with em too Whats up with her Ive been hearin that she been givin that stuff out to ALL them graffiti guys
Yo shut the fuck up Chico man
I could paint three of those murals for some of that ass
Professor whats another word for pirate treasure
Well I think its booty Booty booty thats what it is
Yes I got more bounce than the fucking bump
And then you want to know why
Because Im motherfuckin truckin
Im in the pocket just like Grady Tate
Got supplies of beats so you dont have to wait
Cause Im the master blaster drinking up the Shasta
My voice sounds sweet cause it has to
So light a match to my ass cause Im blowin up
Id like to thank the people for just showin up
But now I want yall to move it
Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And Im smurfin not rehearsin gettin live yall
A little puffy so you know what Im doin right
Cause thats the kind of frame of mind Im in
I got this feelin that its back again
So dont touch me cause Im electric
And if you touch me youll get shocked
You got you got you got you got you got
Youve got the boomin system but its sloshing out doodoo
You think its chocolate milk but its watered down Yoohoo
Ive been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me has always been music
Weve got our own studio the Son of the G
Its no question lifes been good to me
Cause life aint nothing but a good groove
A good mixtape to put ya in the right mood
This one goes out to my man the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which Ive been searching
Like two sealed copies of expansions
Im like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made Ben Davisquality its no junk see
My chrome is shining just like an icicle
I ride around town on my lowrider bicycle
So many wack emcees you get the TV bozak
Aint even gonna call out your names cause youre so wack
And one big oaf whos faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldnt finish
Cause writin rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
Im bad ass move ya fat ass cause youre wack son
Dancing around like you think youre Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
Ill put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
Ill take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an emcee at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped youre rockin rewindpause
Tryin to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like a pencil to the paper I got more to come
One after another you can all get some
So you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
Cause your shitll be stinkin when I go for mine
And thats right yall dont get uptight yall
You cant say shit because youre biting what I write yall
And thats wrong yall over the long haul
You cant cut the mustard when youre fronting it all
it all it all it all
