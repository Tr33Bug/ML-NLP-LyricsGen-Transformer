Rhymin & Stealin Lyrics

Because mutiny on the Bounty's what we're all about
I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out
No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder
'Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder, cold getting colder
Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas
And if you've got beef, you'll get capped in the knees
We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest
And I shot those suckers, and I'll shoot the rest
Most illingest b-boy - I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Shhh-Snatching gold chains, nicking pieces of eight
I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate
We got wenches on the benches and bitties with titties
Housing all girlies from city to city
One for all and all for one
Taking out emcees with a big shotgun
All for one and one for all
Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL
Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat
Big biting suckers gettin' thrown in the moat
We got maidens and wenches, man, they're on the ace
Ah, Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face

Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves

Torching and crackin' and rhymin' and stealin'
Robbin' and raping, busting two in the ceiling
I'm wheelin', I'm dealin', I'm drinking, not thinking
Never cower, never shower, and I'm always stinking
Yo-ho-ho and a pint of Brass Monkey
And when my girlie shakes her hips, she sure gets funky
Skirt-chasin', free-basin', killin' every village
We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage

Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

I wasâ€¦
I've been drinking my rum, a def son of a gun
(I fought the law) And I cold won
Blackbeard's weak, Moby Dick's on the chicks
'Cause I pull out the jammy, and I squeeze off six
My pistol is loaded, I shot Betty Crocker
Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker
Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state
And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate

Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
And I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Most chillinest b-boy
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most killingest b-boy
I am most chill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most dustin'-out b-boy
I tossin' my dust
Most finkiest b-boy
I'm doin' that finkin'
Most rhyminest b-boy
I'm stretchin' my shade
Most shootinest b-boy
I think you're shit
Most rhyminest b-boy
I'll steal your shit, homeboy
Most taxinest b-boy
I tax you, boy
Most illingest, illingest, illingest b-boy
Waxin' all y'all squares
