Because mutiny on the Bountys what were all about
Im gonna board your ship and turn it on out
No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder
Cause Im bad gettin bolder cold getting colder
Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas
And if youve got beef youll get capped in the knees
We got sixteen men on a dead mans chest
And I shot those suckers and Ill shoot the rest
Most illingest bboy  I got that feeling
Cause I am most ill and Im rhymin and stealin
ShhhSnatching gold chains nicking pieces of eight
I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate
We got wenches on the benches and bitties with titties
Housing all girlies from city to city
One for all and all for one
Taking out emcees with a big shotgun
All for one and one for all
Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL
Friggin in the riggin and cuttin your throat
Big biting suckers gettin thrown in the moat
We got maidens and wenches man theyre on the ace
Ah Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face
Most illingest bboy well I got that feeling
I am most ill and Im rhymin and stealin
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Torching and crackin and rhymin and stealin
Robbin and raping busting two in the ceiling
Im wheelin Im dealin Im drinking not thinking
Never cower never shower and Im always stinking
Yohoho and a pint of Brass Monkey
And when my girlie shakes her hips she sure gets funky
Skirtchasin freebasin killin every village
We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage
Most illingest bboy well I got that feeling
I am most ill and Im rhymin and stealin
I was
Ive been drinking my rum a def son of a gun
I fought the law  And I cold won
Blackbeards weak Moby Dicks on the chicks
Cause I pull out the jammy and I squeeze off six
My pistol is loaded I shot Betty Crocker
Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones locker
Rhymin and stealin in a drunken state
And Ill be rockin my rhymes all the way to Hells gate
Most illingest bboy I got that feeling
And I am most ill and Im rhymin and stealin
Most illingest bboy I got that feeling
I am most ill and Im rhymin and stealin
Most illingest bboy I got that feeling
Cause I am most ill and Im rhymin and stealin
