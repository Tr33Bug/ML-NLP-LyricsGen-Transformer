The original nasal kid is doing damage
Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Doing homework on the train what a fucked up situation
On the way back up hearing battle tapes
Through the underground underneath the sky scrapes

Enough of that I just want to give some respect due
MCA grab the mic and Ma Bell will connect you
Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
If dancin prays to the lord then I will feel all right

Tears running down my face cause I love to do it  love to do it 
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master of disaster with a sound thats gone  yeah
