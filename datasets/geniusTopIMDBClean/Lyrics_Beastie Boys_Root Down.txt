The original nasal kid is doing damage
Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Doing homework on the train what a fucked up situation
On the way back up hearing battle tapes
Through the underground underneath the sky scrapes
Its like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show

Enough of that I just want to give some respect due
MCA grab the mic and Ma Bell will connect you


Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
If dancin prays to the lord then I will feel all right

Tears running down my face cause I love to do it  love to do it 
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master of disaster with a sound thats gone  yeah
