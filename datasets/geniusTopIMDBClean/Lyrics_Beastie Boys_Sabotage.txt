I cant stand it I know you planned it
Ima set it straight this Watergate
I cant stand rockin when Im in here
Cause your crystal ball aint so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin thorn in my side
Oh my god its a mirage
Im tellin yall its sabotage
So so so so listen up cause you cant say nothin
Youll shut me down with a push of your button
But yo Im out and Im gone
Ill tell you now I keep it on and on
Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so dont you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing thats a mirage
Im trying to tell you now its sabotage
Why
Our backs are now against the wall 
Listen all yall its a sabotage
Listen all yall its a sabotage
Listen all yall its a sabotage
Listen all yall its a sabotage
I cant stand it I know you planned it
Ima set it straight this Watergate
But I cant stand rockin when Im in this place
Because I feel disgrace because youre all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
Im Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be  its a mirage
Youre scheming on a thing thats sabotage
