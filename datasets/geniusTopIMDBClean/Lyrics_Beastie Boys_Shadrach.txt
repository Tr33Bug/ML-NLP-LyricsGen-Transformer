Riddle me this my brother can you handle it
Your style to my style you cant hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin and drinkin on a Tuesday night
Its not how you play the game its how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and Im a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost but now Im found
The music washes over and youre one with the sound
Well who shall inherit the earth The meek shall
And yo I think Im starting to peak now Al
And then the man upstairs well I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts Id be a millionaire
Were just three emcees and were on the go

Shad Hey hey
Heyheyheyheyheyyeah hmm
Only twentyfour hours in a day
Only twelve notes well a man can play
Music for all but not just one people
And now were gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel
More Adidas sneakers than a plumbers got pliers
Got more suits than Jacoby  Meyers  Wow 
If not for my vices and my buggedout desires
My year would be good just like Goodyears tires
Cause Im out picking pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business and pleasure way too much
You know wine and women and song and such
I dont get blue I got a mean red streak
You dont pay the band your friends yo thats weak
Get even like Steven  Even  like pulling a Rambo
Well Shadrach Meshach Abednego  You know 


Shadrach Meshach Abednego

Shadrach Meshach Abednego  no

Shad Hey hey
Heyheyheyheyheyyeah hmm
Steal from the rich and Im out robbing banks
Givin to the poor and I always give thanks
Because Ive got more stories than JDs got Salinger
I hold the title and you are the challenger
Ive got money like Charles Dickens
Ive got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonels got the chickens
And Im always going out dapper like Harry S Truman
Im madder than Mads Alfred E Newman

Oh never gonna let em say that I dont love you 
Shadrach Meshach Abednego 
Shadrach Meshach Abednego 
Well my noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts
And Adam Yoggin is Yauch and hes rockin of course wow
Smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Like Jerry Lee Swaggart or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter  Say what  The popcorn
Sippin on wine and mackin
Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin yeah
Ride the wave of fate it dont ride me Homes
Being very proud of bein emcees 
And then the man upstairs well I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts Id be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Because the bass is bumping from the back of my Fleetwood
They tell us what to do Hell no
