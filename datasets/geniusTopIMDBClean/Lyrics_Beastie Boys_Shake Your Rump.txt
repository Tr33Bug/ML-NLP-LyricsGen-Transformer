Now I rock a house party at the drop of a hat  yeah 
Now I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat
A lot of people they be Jonesin just to hear me rock the mic
They be staring at the radio staying up all night
So like a pimp Im pimpin I got a boat to eat shrimp in
Nothing wrong with my leg Im just Bboy limpin
Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float
My man MCAs got a beard like a billy goat
Oohooh is my disco call
MCA  huhuh  Im gettin rope yall
Routines I bust and the rhymes that I write
And Ill be busting routines and rhymes all night
Like eating burgers or chicken and youll be picking ya nose man
Im on time homie thats how it goes
You heard my style I think you missed the point
Its the joint
Mike D  Yeah  With your bad self running things
Whats up  With your bad breath onion rings
Well Im Mike D and Im back from the dead
Chillin at the beach down at Club Med
Make another record cause the people they want more of this
Suckers they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz
Hurricane you got clout
Other DJs hell put your head out
A puppet on a string Im paid to sing or rhyme
Or do my thing Im in a lava lamp inside my brain hotel
I might be freakin or peakin but I rock well
The Patty Duke Show the Wrench and then I bust the Tango
Got more rhymes than Jamaica got mango
I got the peg leg at the end of my stumpa
Shake your rumpa
A full clout yall a full clout yall
And when the mic is in my mouth I turn it out yall
A full clout
Never been dumped cause Im the most mackinest
Never been jumped cause Im known the most packinest
Yeah weve got beef chief were knocking out teeth chief
And if you dont believe us you should question your belief Keith
Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat
Like Fred Flintstone driving around with bald feet
Should I have another sip Nah skip it
In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
Ropeadope dookies all around the neck
Running from the law the press and the parents
No mines Clarence
From downtown Manhattan the Village
My style is wild and you know that it still is
Disco bag schlepping and youre doing the bump
Shake your rumpa
