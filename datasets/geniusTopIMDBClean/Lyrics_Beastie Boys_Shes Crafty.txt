Well this girl came up to me she says shes new in town
But the crew been said they seen her around
I thought they were right but I didnt want to know
The girlie was def and she wanted to go
I think her name is Lucy but they all call her Loose
I think I thought I seen her on Eighth and Fortydeuce
The next thing she said was My place or yours
Lets kick some bass behind closed doors
We got into the cab the cab driver said
He recognized my girlie from the back of her head
He said a little something about tip to base
So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place
Shouldve looked back man Ill always regret it
Somethings going on and Ill probably never get it
She was crying like a baby stupid dumb
Its just too bad that girls a bum
Shes crafty she gets around
Shes crafty shes always down
Shes crafty you know shes got a gripe
Shes crafty and shes just my type
Shes crafty 
I spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett
When I seen this girl I could never forget
Now I like nothing better than a pretty girls smile
And I havent seen a smile that pretty in a while
The girl came up to me she said she loved the show
I asked her to come home and she couldnt say no
We got to the crib and there was Adam and D
We didnt say a word they just stared at me
I said I dont know her I just met her tonight
And AdRock started hiding everything in sight
D pulled me over said Hide your gold
The girl is crafty like ice is cold
The girl is crafty she knows all the moves
I started playing records she knew all the grooves
He thought she was a thief and D was right
But I just figured shed spend the night
When I woke up late in the afternoon
She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself naked in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers
The mirror the TV the new guitar cord
My remote control and my old skateboard
She robbed us blind she took all we owned
And the boys blamed me for bringing her home


Shes crafty she gets around
Shes crafty shes always down
Shes crafty shes got a gripe
Shes crafty and shes just my type
Shes crafty
Aw yeah 
Shes crafty she gets around
Shes crafty shes always down
Shes crafty shes got a gripe
Shes crafty and shes just my type
Shes crafty she gets around
Shes crafty shes always down
Shes crafty shes got a gripe
Shes crafty and shes just my type
Shes crafty
