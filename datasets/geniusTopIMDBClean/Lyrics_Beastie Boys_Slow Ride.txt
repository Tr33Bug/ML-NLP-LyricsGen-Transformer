They got a committee to get me off the block
Cause I say my rhymes loud and I say em nonstop
Because being bad news is what were all about
We went to White Castle and we got thrown out
I got my boy Mike D I got the King Adrock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler grabbed a cool Bud
Slow riding gun hidin on the go
Im fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow
Im the king of the classroom coolin in the back
My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack
She chased me out of class she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand at the microphone stand
Ay yo homeboy what you drinkin man
I got money I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the def behinds
I got ill I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey
Because Im hard hittin always bitten cool as hell
I got the trees on my mirror so my car wont smell
Sittin around the house gettin high watchin tube
Im eating Colonels chicken drinkin Heineken brew
Im a gangster Im a prankster Im the king of the ave
Im hated confrontated for the juice that I have
All the fine ladies are making a fuss
But I cant pay attention cause Im on that dust
