Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Its never old school all brand new
So everybody catch the bugaloo flu
Not like a fever not like a cold
The beats are clear the rhymes are bold
So dont see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music first things first
First of all get off the wall
Its time to party so have a ball
We slowed it on down so get the hell up
Like a volcano Ill erupt
We got determination bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you aint seen nothing yet
So let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
I do not sing but I make a def song
You could live your whole life and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show we wont get gonged
Were the Beastie Boys not Cheech and Chong
Strong as a ox fresh out the box
The crowd is so live theyre coming in flocks
And when we go on the crowd goes off
Its all hard rock theres nothing soft
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
COD  So let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
And let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo


Now we not only rock the house but we house the rock
We dont stroll but we roll straight to the top
MCA AdRock Mike D makes three
And we can do it like this in the place to be
When Im recorded youll be rewarded
I know my song is def cause you all applauded
Not PCP or LSD  just me Mike D in the place to be
This is not free you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a COD
So let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
And let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
The beat is slow in order to dance
I wanna hear I dos and no I cants
First move your leg and then your arm
Its not fast and nervous this dance is calm
Its truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when its on the turntable
So let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
And let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
And let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
And let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
