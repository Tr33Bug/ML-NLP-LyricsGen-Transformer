To Mario Cyou cant front on that
Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
Youre eating crazy cheese like you would think Im from Paris
You know I get fly you think I get high
You know that Im gone and Ima tell you all why
So tell me who are you dissing maybe Im missing
The reason that youre smiling or wyling so listen
In my head I just want to take em down
Imagination set loose and Im gonna shake em down
Let it flow like a mudslide
When I get on I like to ride and glide
Ive got depth of perception in my text yall
I get props at my mention cause I vex yall
So whatcha whatcha whatcha want  whatcha want 
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said Whered you get your information from huh
You think that you can front when revelation comes
Yeah you cant front on that 
Well they call me Mike D the everloving man
Im like Spoonie Gee  whoo ooh  Im the metropolitician  yeyeyeyeah 
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar
But like a dream Im flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
Going from mic to mic kickin it wall to wall
Well Ill be calling out to people like a casting call


Ah well its wack when youre jacked in the back of a ride
With your know with your flow when youre out getting by
Believe me what you see is what you get
And you see me Im coming off as you can bet
Well I think Im losing my mind this time
This time Im losing my mind thats right
I said I think Im losing my mind this time
This time Im losing my mind
Yeah you cant front on that
But little do you know about something that I talk about
Im tired of driving its due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime Im wise to the demise
Ive got eyes in the back of my head so I realize
Well Im Dr Spock Im here to rock yall
I want you off the wall if youre playing the wall
I said whatcha whatcha whatcha want  whatcha want 
I said whatcha whatcha whatcha want  whatcha want 
Yall suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See Im the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
Im the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena
Well Im as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
Youve got the rhyme and reason but got no cause
But if youre hot to trot you think youre slicker than grease
Ive got news for you crews youll be sucking like a leech
Yeah you cant front on that
So whatcha whatcha whatcha want  whatcha want 
So whatcha whatcha whatcha want  whatcha want 
I said so whatcha whatcha whatcha want  whatcha want 
I said so whatcha whatcha whatcha want  whatcha want
