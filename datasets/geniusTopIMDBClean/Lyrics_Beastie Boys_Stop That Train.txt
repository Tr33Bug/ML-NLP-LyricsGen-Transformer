Its 4am Ive got the Hasenpfeffer Ale
Ive got nothing to lose so Im pissing on the third rail
Groggyeyed and fried and Im headed for the station
Dtrain ride to Coney Island vacation
This ones dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1train
Theyll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstile I lost my last token
Riding between the cars pissing smoking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy Yo put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post Fulton Street downtown
Same faces every day but you dont know their names
Party people going places on the D train
Stop that train I wanna get on
Check it
Trench coat wingtip going to work
And youll be pullin a train like youre Captain Kirk
Pickpocket gangsters payin their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernhard Goetz
Overworked and underpaid starin at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors
Now youre stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
5000 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise your Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin
Elevated platform Im never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductors booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loudspeaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin El Diario
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station to Orange Julius
I bought a hot dog  from WHO George Drakoulias
