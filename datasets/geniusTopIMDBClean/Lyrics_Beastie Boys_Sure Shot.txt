I love you
Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop
Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop
Well you cant you wont and you dont stop
Mike D come and rock the sure shot
Ive got the brand new doodoo guaranteed like Yoohoo
Im on like Dr John yeah Mr Zu Zu
Im a newlywed not a divorcee  yeah 
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey
Well its the taking of the Pelham 1 2 3
If you want a doodoo rhyme then come see me
Ive got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin
I keep it on and on its never quitting time and
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles and Im ready to go
Cause at the boards is the man they call the Mario
You pull up at the function and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac
Ive got more action than my man John Woo
And Ive got mad hits like I was Rod Carew  yeah 
Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop
Because you cant you wont and you dont stop
You know you cant you wont and you dont stop
AdRock come and rock the sure shot
Hurra Hurra
Cane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums
Listen everybody cause Im shifting gears
Im fresh like Dougie when I get my specs
And on the microphone I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hiphop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
Ive got more rhymes than Ive got gray hairs
And thats a lot because Ive got my share  oohh weee 
Ive got a hole in my head and theres no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
Im thinking too much  yeah  sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes takes takes takes
Ill have to step back I gotta contemplate
Well Im like Lee Perry Im very on
Rock the microphone and then Im gone
Im like Vaughn Bode Im a Cheech Wizard
Never quittin so wont you listen
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah yes indeed its fun time
Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop
Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop
Well you cant you wont and you dont stop
MCA come and rock the sure shot
I want to say a little something thats long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well you say Im twentysomething then I should be slacking
But Im working harder than ever and you could call it macking
So Im supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
Im still listening to wax Im not using the CD
Well Im that kid in the corner
All fucked up and I wanna so Im gonna  yeah 
Take a piece of the pie why not Im not quittin
Think Ima change up my style just to fit in
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
I use a bullshit mic thats made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell I got the ill communication
Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop
Cause you cant you wont and you dont stop
Well you cant you wont and you dont stop
Keep on and rockin the sure shot
Bboys bgirls
Ticktock tickticktocktock
