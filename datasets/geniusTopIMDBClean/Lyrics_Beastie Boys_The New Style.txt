And on the cool checkin
Centerstage on the mic
And we puttin it on wax
Its the new style
Four and three and two and one  What up 
And when Im on the micthe suckers run  Word 
Down with AdRock and Mike D and you aint
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
Im not surprised youre on my dick  Mike D 
BEASTIE
What up Mike D
Awyeahthats me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it I got itI know its good
The rhymes I writeyou wish you would
Im never in training my voice is not straining
People always biting and Im sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker and I smashed your glasses
Youre from SecaucusIm from Manhattan
Youre jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin
There it is 
Kick it
Father to manymarried to none
And in case youre unaware I carry a gun  Word 
Stepped into the party the place was overpacked
Saw the kid that dissed my homeboy shot him in the back
Man I had to get a beeper cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut cause Im fully strapped
I got money in the bank I can still get high
Thats why your girlfriend thinks that Im so fly
Ive got money and juice twin sisters in my bed
Their father had envy so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar Id be Jimmy Page
The girlies I like are underage  Shh Check it 
Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like
Ill steal your honey like I stole your bike
My father hes jealous cause Im making that green  What up 
Ive got a list of girlies numbers from the places Ive been
There it is 
Kick it


You wanna know why Because Im
October 31st that is my date of birth
I got to the party you know what I did The Smurf
Taxin all the females from coast to coast
And when I get my fill Im chilly most
We ragtag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle cause its the best
But Im fly at Fatburger whenwhen hesIm way out west  Check it

All the fine ladies theyre on my jammy
Went to the promwore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt  Check it 
Spent some bank got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a woolywhatd he doand I watched Columbo
Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies feel the beat
Mmmdrop
Coolin on the corner on a hot summers  day
Just me my posse andMCA
A lot of beer a lot of girls and a lot of cursin
22 automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my fingers on the trigger
My posses gettin bigand my posses gettin bigger
Some voices got treblesome voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face
Like the bun to the burgerand like the burger to the bun
