Now here we go dropping science dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when youre driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles Isaac Newton a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite gettin ova with the key
Now rock shocker the mike of the many times times the times tables
Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new knowledge
An emcee to a degree that you cant get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
Ive got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium the radium EMD squared
Kicked out of the Palladium dja think that I cared
Its the sounds of science the sounds of science
Science
RopeaDope
The newest in new Right up to your face and diss you
Waxin and milkin
All of yall square heads
Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reelin and rockin and rollin Bsized Dcup
Order the Quarter Deluxe why dontcha wake up
My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector
Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked and exploded
She woke up in the morning and her face was coated
Buddy you study the man on the mic
D do whatcha like  Huh 
Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well I figured out who makes the crack its
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Professor of science cuz I keep droppin it
I smell weak cuz yall keep poppin it
People always ask me whats the phenomenon
Yo whats up Yo whats goin on
No one really knows what Im talkin about
And yeah thats right my names Yauch
Ponce De Leon constantly on
The fountain of youth not Robotron
Peace is a word Ive heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor
Cuz Im gonna die gonna die one day
Cuz Im goin and goin and goin this way
Not like a roach or a piece of toast
Im goin out first class aint goin out coach
Rock my Adidas never rock Filas
I do not sniff the coke I only smoke the sinsemilla
Well with my nose I knows and with my scope I scopes
What I live I write and thats strictly rope
I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equations
Well Cheech Wizard in a snow blizzard
Eat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy
Dropping science like Galileo dropped the orange
