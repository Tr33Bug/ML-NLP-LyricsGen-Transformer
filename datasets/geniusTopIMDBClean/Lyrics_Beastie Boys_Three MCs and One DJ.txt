Youll wanna get next to me in Rose Royce  Royce 
Yall gather round to hear my golden voice
Cause when its time to rhyme you know I get noice  voice 
Hes cruising like a fan boat on the glade
Hell tweak your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage  stage   woo 
Or hell send you off on a naked rampage
Three MCs and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike whatcha got to say
Bug out To The mic All the time 
Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kreme
Kenny Rogers Gambler is my gambling theme

You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below
Ed Norton is chillin with Mario  woowee

But dont get mad when we gots to go
Three MCs and one DJ

All top secret and classified  fied 
I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide
Its all hypnotic and sanctified  woowee 
I never wanna let a bad day slip by

Causing all kinds of hysteria  steria 
My beats is sick like malaria
But dont worry Ill take care of ya

In the studio with the place to be
To all the party people who are happy and free  free
