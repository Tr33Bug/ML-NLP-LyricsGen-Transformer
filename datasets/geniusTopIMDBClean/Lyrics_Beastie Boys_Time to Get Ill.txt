Whats the time
Its time to get ill
And whats the time
Its time to get ill
So whats the time
Its time to get ill
Now whats the time
Its time to get ill
Im not the type of person who likes to waste my time
And when Im on the mic I just say my rhymes
And Im out on bail the check is in the mail
They can sentence me to life and I wont go to jail
Im cool calm collected from class I was ejected
Just me Mike D and MCA were rarely disrespected
I got all the time that I need to kill
Whats the time Its time to get ill
You been fully captivated by that funkyass bass
Your girlfriend screams when MCAs in the place
He stumbles in the room with the Chivas in his hand
Cold chillin in the spot at the microphone stand
Id have the pedal to the metal if I had a car
But Im chiller with the Miller cold coolin at the bar
I can drink a quart of Monkey and still stand still
Whats the time Its time to get ill
Yeah
Looklookinlooklooklooklook
Lookin at my Gucci its about that time
Lookin at my Gucci its about that time
Deee
Went outside my house I went down to the deli
I spent my last dime to refill my fat belly
I got rhymes galime I got rhymes galilla
And I got more rhymes than Phyllis Diller
MCA takes a stand man youre in command
Homebody turn it out and dont give a damn
Man my name is MCA Ive got a license to kill
And whats the time Its time to get ill


Im Mr Ed
The famous Mr Ed
Riding down the blockuhuhh
Riding down the block with my box in my hand
Today I feel like chillin just as chill as I can
Coolin on the corner with a forty of OE
Cause me and MCA were down with Mike D
Man when I run a jam I dont give a damn
When Im throwing bass I say Thank you maam
Fuel injected rhyme connected running things
Well Im the King AdRock and Im the king of all kings
Im looking for a spot things are gettin hot

Oh no it could not be its such a sight to see
