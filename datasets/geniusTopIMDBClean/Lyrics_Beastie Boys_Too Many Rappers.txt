Mic check mic check
Beastie Boys 
One  one  two  two  three  three 
Too many rappers and theres still not enough MCs
It goes three  three  two  two  one  one 
MCA Adrock Mike D thats how we get it done
Like ladies and gents attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators we can point em out
So if you got somethin on your mind let it out
Yo I been in the game since before you was born
I might still be MCing even after youre gone
Strange thought I know but my skills still grow
The 80s the 90s 2000s and so
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
Stay up all night and I MC and never die
Cause death is the cousin of sleep
Because Im back with a bang boogie oogieoogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God just look at me
Grandpa been rappin since 83
Im supersonic like JJ Fad
Got crazyass shit pullin out the bag
Dont forget the tartar sauce yo cause its sad
All these crab rappers theyre rappin like crabs
I have carte blanche the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist my pockets are rotund
Im no killa but compared to you Im more reala
You aint a shot a mobster or a drug dealer
A slug peeler youre not
Mafioso no
You aint got the cutthroat in ya beginner
I aint tryin to hear your racket
You work with police dog you snitch you rat
You wear that jacket
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce ooh when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos
Bullets and banditos
Matzoh balls in soup
Jackets and troop
Yes yall this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas whats the word
Count it off on the hook
Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on offa Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin stacks like Stax Records
My squad we gotta pact  were never coming wack
To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake I stole the mold
The golden microphone well thats mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace
Sniffin buffin huffin
And mean muggin with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me suckas you aint sayin nothin
Im broader than Broadway I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder lacin oratorials all day
Im just getting started on this beat this is foreplay
And when this songs finished yall can sing along with this
By the way I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blondes the wettest
But anyway I better pay homage to my fellas
And thats whats on my mind and the rhyme whos next up
Mike D the man of mystery
History in the makin and now were takin
Titles awards and accolades
Scarin the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper like Picasso and canvases
Rockin stadiums and shitty bars
Go back in time send a fax from my car
