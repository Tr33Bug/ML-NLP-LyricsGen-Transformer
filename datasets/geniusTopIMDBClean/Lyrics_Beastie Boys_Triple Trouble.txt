See I like to party not drink Bacardi
Cause Im not looking to throw up on nobody
Known for my spiel a wheelie one wheel
Cause this is like having a delicious meal
And well moving the crowd well thats a must

And thats mesmerizing tantalizing
Captivating were devastating
If you  if you

Heres one for the bleachers and the upper tier

Run this rap game like a brigadier

Snares on the five and thirteen
Rhymes on time and thats the given
Were hot on the disco scene checkit checkit
Slow down with Ime got to stop stingin
The source of the problem is at the origin

Youre like a fishwife quit your damn whingin

Bam Super nature god damn
Cerrone on the microphone I am
AdRock aka sharp cheddar

What the Helen of Troy is that
Did I hear you say my rhymes is wack
Im beautiful you cant touch me
If you pick a rose well you might just bleed
Were originators you cant feign
Ignorance or pass the blame
Nuff rhymes coming out the brain
Nuff beats to drive you insane
Nuff moves to make your neck crane
Nuff skill to make the rhymes ingrain
Nuff heat to leave you in flames
Nuff style that you cant defame
You see I walk like Jabba The Hutt
With the style so new yall be like What
Turn the party out like a bon vivant
With the skill at will that I know you want
On a hot day with the iced latte
Devious like Wyle E Coyote
Hot to trote or maybe note
Cause little did they know there was a baby in her body
Were mesmerizing tantalizing captivating and devastating
If you  if you 
Wanna know  wanna know 
The real deal about the three
Well let me tell you
Were triple trouble yall
Were gonna bring you up to speed  check it out
