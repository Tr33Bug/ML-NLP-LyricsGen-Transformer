What goes around comes back around  Hey my baby 
What goes around comes back around  My my my baby 
I say what goes around comes back around  Hey my baby 
What goes around comes back around
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies no wrong
Boy I mustve been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
Im so over you so baby good looking out
I wanted you bad Im so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And Im gon always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad youre hurt
Boo hoo oh did you expect me to care
You dont deserve my tears
I guess thats why they aint there
To think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
Im so over you baby good looking out


I wanted you bad Im so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And Ill never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby I bet it sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
Its time to face the facts
That Im the one thats got away
Lord knows that it would take another place another time
Another world another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye
