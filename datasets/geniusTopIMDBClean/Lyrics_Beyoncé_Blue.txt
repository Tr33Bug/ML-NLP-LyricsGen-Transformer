Sometimes these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes I feel alive
Some days we say words that dont mean a thing
But when youre holdin me tight I feel alive
Make it last forever
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me

Each day I feel so blessed to be lookin at you
Cause when you open your eyes I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When Im holdin you tight Im so alive
Now lets lets live it up
Make it last forever
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me
Blue
Make it last forever
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me
We gotta hold on
I gotta hold on
Youve got to hold on
Youve got a hold on a hold on to me
We gotta hold on
I gotta hold on
Youve got to hold on
Youve got a hold on a hold on me
Make it last forever
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me
You and I together
Come on baby wont you hold on to me hold on to me
Blue
