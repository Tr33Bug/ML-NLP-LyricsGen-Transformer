Kinm in kalot ot Mandela
Tw la pa mt dan la gl banna

Wewewewewewewewewewewewewewewewe be all night
Woo You will never need another lover
Woo Cause you a MILF and Im a motherfucker
Told you give the drummer some now the drummer cummin
Im parumpapumpumin all on your stomach
Yuh tonight I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein stripper to a super CEO
I dont know the way you do it but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money you dont need nobody else
But far as handlin all that ass I think you gon need some help
Let me remind you you got a you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do
I aint no pastor dont do missionary
I know good pussy when I see it Im a visionary
I know them haters talkin always had us very wary
Yup On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup You love the way Im turnt
After all the money you earned still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse you reverse and I impregnated your mouth girl
Ooooh thats when I knew you could be my spouse girl
We fuckin all over the house girl
We just messed up a brand new couch girl
If you aint on site then you on Skype
I put you on that bike you bound girl
We too wild wont turn down
We drunk in love fuck them
Ive been drinkin Ive been drinkin
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
Ive been thinkin Ive been thinkin
Why cant I keep my fingers off it baby
I want you na na
Why cant I keep my fingers off you baby
I want you na na
Cigars on ice cigars on ice
Feelin like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin lights flashin lights
You got me faded faded faded
Baby I want you na na
Cant keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you na na
Drunk in love I want you
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin How the hell did this shit happen
Oh baby drunk in love
We be all night last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin up in that club drunk in love
We be all night love love
We be all night love love


We be all night and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy Im drinkin park it in my lot 711
Im rubbin on it rubrubbin
If you scared call that reverend
Boy Im drinkin get my brain right
Armand de Brignac gangster wife
Louis sheets he sweat it out
Like washrags he wear it out
Boy Im drinkin Im singin on the mic to my boys toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard surfboard surfboard
Grainin on that wood
Grainin grainin on that wood
Im swervin on that swervin swervin on that
Big body Benz servin all this
Swerve surfin all in this goodgood
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin How the hell did this shit happen
Oh baby drunk in love
We be all night last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin up in that club drunk in love
We be all night love love
We be all night love love
Im nice right now hold up
That Duss is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself if I do say so myself
Hold up stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking bout you be reppin that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh foreplay in a foyer fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Aint got the time to take drawers off
On sight catch a charge I might
Beat the box up like Mike in 97 I bite
Im Ike Turner turn up baby no I dont play
Now eat the cake Anna Mae
Said Eat the cake Anna Mae
Im nice for yall to reach these heights
You gon need G3 4 5 6 flights
Sleep tight we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin in we be all night
We be all night love love
We be all night love love
Im never tired never tired
I been sippin thats the only thing
Thats keepin me on fire we on fire
Didnt mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
Ive been drinkin watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy I want you right now
Cant keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you
We be all night love love
We be all night love love
