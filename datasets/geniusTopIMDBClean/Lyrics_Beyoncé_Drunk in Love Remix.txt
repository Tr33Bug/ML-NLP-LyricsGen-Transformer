Drunk in Love (Remix) Lyrics
Kinm in kalot oté Mandela
Twé la pa mèt dan la gèl banna
Twé la pèt amwin
We—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we—we be all night

Woo! You will never need another lover
Woo! 'Cause you a MILF and I'm a motherfucker
Told you give the drummer some, now the drummer cummin'
I'm pa-rum-pa-pum-pumin' all on your stomach
Yuh, tonight, I see some super freaky hoes
That could go from bein' stripper to a super CEO
I don't know the way you do it, but you do it to me though
And you always told your girlfriends you need you a TV show
Now you got your own money, you don't need nobody else
But far as handlin' all that ass, I think you gon' need some help
Let me remind you, you got a, you got a great future behind you
You gotta tell me what we tryna do
I ain't no pastor, don't do missionary
I know good pussy when I see it, I'm a visionary
I know them haters talkin', always had us very wary
Yup! On the 35th of Nevuary
Yup! You love the way I'm turnt
After all the money you earned, still show daddy what you learned
That cowgirl, you reverse that cowgirl
You reverse, you reverse, and I impregnated your mouth, girl
Ooooh, that's when I knew you could be my spouse, girl
We fuckin' all over the house, girl
We just messed up a brand new couch, girl
If you ain't on site, then you on Skype
I put you on that bike, you bound, girl
We too wild, won't turn down
We drunk in love, fuck them
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
You might also like
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin', swervin' on that
Big body Benz servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
We woke up in the kitchen
Sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club, drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now... hold up!
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve
Uh, foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love474Embed
