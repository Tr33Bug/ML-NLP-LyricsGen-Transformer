Part II Flawless
We teach girls to shrink themselves to make themselves smaller
We say to girls You can have ambition but not too much
You should aim to be successful but not too successful
Otherwise you will threaten the man
Because I am female I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important  CCandy on the ground 
Now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support  Dumdadeeda 
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we dont teach boys the same  Dodada dodo dodododa 
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments which I think can be a good thing  Comcomcomin down drippin candy on the ground 
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are  Dumdadeda 
Feminist A person who believes in the social political and economic equality of the sexes  Dodada dodo dodododa
