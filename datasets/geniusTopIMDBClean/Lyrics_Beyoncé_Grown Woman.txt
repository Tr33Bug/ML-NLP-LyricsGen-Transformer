I remember being young tough brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me Im a big girl now said Im gon do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this
Cause I put it down like that ddown like that
And Im making all these racks aall these racks
And Im moving round like that rround like that
When I do it I dont look back ddont look back
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
They love the way I walk
Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk cause I aint pretending
It took a while now I understand just where Im goin
I know the world and I know who I am Its bout time I show it
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
Im a grown woman
I can do whatever I want


Im a grown woman and I know that I got it
Im a grown woman aint got no room in my pockets
Im a grown woman look down got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl she got that bomb that bomb
That girl can get whatever she wants
That girl she got that tight that tight
Them boys will do whatever she likes
