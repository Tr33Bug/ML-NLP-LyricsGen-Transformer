Remember those walls I built
Well baby theyre tumblin down
And they didnt even put up a fight
They didnt even make a sound
I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standin in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
Its like Ive been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin
Its the risk that Im takin
I aint never gonna shut you out
Everywhere Im lookin now
Im surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know youre my savin grace
Youre everything I need and more
Its written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it wont fade away
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin through my darkest night
Youre the only one that I want
Think Im addicted to your light
I swore Id never fall again
But this dont even feel like fallin
Gravity cant forget
To pull me back to the ground again


Its like Ive been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin
The risk that Im takin
Im never gonna shut you out
Everywhere Im lookin now
Im surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know youre my savin grace
Youre everything I need and more
Its written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it wont fade away
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Halo
Halo
Vocalisations
Everywhere Im lookin now
Im surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know youre my savin grace
Youre everything I need and more
Its written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it wont fade away
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo  Oohooh
