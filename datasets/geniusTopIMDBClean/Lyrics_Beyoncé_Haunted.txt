Part I Ghost
The winner is Beyonc Knowles female pop vocalist
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love I love you Houston
And Ive been driftin off on knowledge
Catcalls on catwalks man these women gettin solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind cant help but wonder How come
Spoonfed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When Im lookin off the edge I preach my gut it cant help but ignore it
Im climbin up the walls cause all the shit I hear is borin
All the shit I do is borin all these record labels borin
I dont trust these record labels Im torn
All these people on the planet workin ninetofive just to stay alive
The ninetofive just to stay alive the ninetofive just to stay alive
The ninetofive just to stay alive the ninetofive just to stay alive
The ninetofive just to stay alive the ninetofive just to stay alive
All the people on the planet workin ninetofive just to stay alive how come
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around
Around
Around
Around
Around  Will it be forever 
Around  What are you gonna do 
Around  What are you gonna do 
Around
Soul not for sale
Probably wont make no money off this oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so mmm
Part II Haunted
Its what you do its what you see
I know if Im hauntin you you must be hauntin me
Its where we go its where well be
I know if Im onto you Im onto you
Onto you you must be onto me
My haunted lungs ghost in the sheets
I know if Im onto you you must be hauntin me
My wicked tongue where will it be
I know if Im onto you Im onto you
Onto you Im onto you
Onto you you must be onto me


You want me
I walk down the hallway
You like it
The bedrooms my runway
Slap me
Im pinned to the doorway
Kiss bite foreplay
My haunted lungs ghost in the sheets
I know if Im hauntin you you must be hauntin me
My wicked tongue where will it be
I know if Im onto you you must be onto me
Its what we see
I know if Im hauntin you you must be hauntin me
Its where we go its where well be
I know if Im onto you Im onto you
Onto you Im onto you
Onto you you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
Onto you Im onto you 
Me  Onto you Im onto you 
Me me  Onto you Im onto you 
Me  Onto you Im onto you
