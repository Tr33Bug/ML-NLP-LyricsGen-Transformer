I fought for you the hardest
It made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just cant stand to see you leavin
But Heaven couldnt wait for you
No Heaven couldnt wait for you
Heaven couldnt wait for you no
No Heaven couldnt wait for you
So go on go home
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed
Heaven couldnt wait for you
Heaven couldnt wait for you
Oh Heaven couldnt wait for you
No Heaven couldnt wait for you you you you you you
No Heaven couldnt wait for you no
Heaven couldnt wait for you no
Heaven couldnt wait for you oh
Heaven couldnt wait for you
So go on go home
So go on go home
Padre Nuestro que ests en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre
Venga tu reino
Hagase tu voluntad
En la tierra como en el cielo
Amen
