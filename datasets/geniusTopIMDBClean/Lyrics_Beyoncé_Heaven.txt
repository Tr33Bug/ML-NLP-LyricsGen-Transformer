Heaven Lyrics

I fought for you the hardest
It made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leavin'
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you, no
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
Oh, Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you, you, you, you, you, you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you, no
Heaven couldn't wait for you, no
Heaven couldn't wait for you, oh
Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
So go on, go home

Padre Nuestro, que est√°s en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre
Venga tu reino
Hagase tu voluntad
En la tierra como en el cielo
