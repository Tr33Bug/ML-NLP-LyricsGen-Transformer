If I were a boy
Even just for a day
Id roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
Id kick it with who I wanted
And Id never get confronted for it
Cause theyd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear Id be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause hes taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone its broken
So theyd think that I was sleepin alone
Id put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that shed be faithful
Waitin for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand ohooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear Id be a better man
Id listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted  Wanted 
Cause hes taken you for granted  Granted 
And everything you had got destroyed
Its a little too late for you to come back
Say its just a mistake
Think Id forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But youre just a boy
You dont understand  Yeah you dont understand oh 
How it feels to love a girl
Someday youll wish you were a better man
You dont listen to her
You dont care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause youve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But youre just a boy
