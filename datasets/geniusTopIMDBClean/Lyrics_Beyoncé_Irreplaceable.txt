Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet thats my stuff
Yes if I bought it nigga please dont touch  Dont touch 
And keep talking that mess thats fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And its my name thats on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Tellin me how Im such a fool
Talkin bout how Ill never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know bout me
You must not know bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact hell be here in a minute baby
You must not know bout me
You must not know bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So dont you ever for a second get to thinking
Youre irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if shes home
Oops I bet you thought that I didnt know
What did you think I was putting you out for
Cause you was untrue
Rollin her round in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves


Standing in the front yard
Tellin me how Im such a fool
Talkin bout how Ill never ever find a man like you
