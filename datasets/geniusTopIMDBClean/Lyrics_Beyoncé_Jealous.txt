Im in my penthouse halfnaked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink in this glass
Dont make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you not honest
Now you got me yellin thats because Im jealous
If youre keepin your promise Im keepin mine
Oh Im jealous
If youre keepin your promise Im keepin mine  Oh Im jealous 
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that Ill never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you cant survive like this
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Yonc fillin out this skirt
I look damn good I aint lost it
And I aint missed a beat
Boy you been hangin out at night tonight Im stayin out til tomorrow
Dancin on them tables aint got no cares no sorrows
I ran into my ex said What up to his besties
Now we reminiscin how we used to flex in Texas dont be jealous
If youre keepin your promise Im keepin mine
Oh Im jealous
If youre keepin your promise Im keepin mine  Im jealous 


Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that Ill never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you cant survive like this no no no
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for makin good love to each other
And I love makin you jealous but dont judge me
And I know that Im bein hateful but that aint nothing
That aint nothing
Im just jealous Im just human
Dont judge me
If youre keepin your promise Im keepin mine  Dont judge me 
Oh Im jealous
If youre keepin your promise Im keepin mine
