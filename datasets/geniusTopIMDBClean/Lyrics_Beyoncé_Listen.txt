Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but cant complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
Its only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own all cause you wont listen
Listen I am alone at a crossroads
Im not at home in my own home
And Ive tried and tried
To say whats on my mind
You should have known oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what youve made of me
I found the voice you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh Im screamin out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside on words
Into your own all cause you wont listen
Listen I am alone at a crossroads
Im not at home in my own home
And Ive tried and tried
To say whats on my mind
You should have known oh
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what
Youve made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own
I dont know where I belong
But Ill be moving on
If you dont if you wont
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete
Now Im done believin you
You dont know what Im feelin
Im more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now Ive gotta find my own
My own
