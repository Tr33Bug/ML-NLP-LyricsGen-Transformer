Ten times out of nine I know youre lying
But nine times out of ten I know youre trying
So Im trying to be fair
And youre trying to be there and to care
And youre caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving Ive been giving goes unnoticed
Its just floating in the air lookie there
Are you aware youre my lifeline are you tryna kill me
If I wasnt me would you still feel me
Like on my worst day Or am I not thirsty enough
I dont care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up skin thick too tough mmm
Cause you you you you and me could move a mountain
You you you you and me could calm a war down
You you you you and me could make it rain now
You you you you and me could stop this love drought
Nine times out of ten Im in my feelings
But ten times out of nine Im only human
Tell me what did I do wrong
Feel like that question has been posed Im movin on
I always been committed I been focused
I always paid attention been devoted
Tell me what did I do wrong
Oh already asked that my bad
But you my lifeline think you tryna kill me
If I wasnt B would you still feel me
Like on my worst day Or am I not thirsty enough
I dont care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up them old bitches so wack
Im so tough wassup
Cause you you you you and me could move a mountain
You you you you and me could calm a war down
You you you you and me could make it rain now
And you you you you and me will stop this love drought


You you you you and me will stop this love drought
You you you you and me will stop this love drought
