Bring the beat in
Honey honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Cant you see the glow on the window pane
I can feel the sun whenever youre near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why Im smiling out from ear to ear
They say love hurts  But I know
Its gonna take a little work  Oh
Nothings perfect but its worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
Baby its you youre the one I love
Youre the one I need youre the only one I see
Come on baby its you
Youre the one that gives your all
Youre the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
Ooh come on baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
Ooh come on baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
Baby baby I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again and again and again and again


Now everybody asks me why Im smiling out from ear to ear
They say love hurts  But I know
