All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
Here you go trippin
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road wit my people just doin what I gotta do
Theres nothin goin on that shouldnt be goin on
You got to trust me ma
I cant believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when its wrong
I cant believe I fell for your schemes Im smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me youre a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized Ive got
Me myself and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on Im gon be my own best friend
Me myself and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on Im gon be my own best friend
Youre so controlling you say that you love me but you dont
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know Im dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when its wrong
Now that its over stop callin me
Come pick up your clothes
Aint no need to front like youre still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time but now I am strong
Because I realized Ive got


Me myself and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on Im gon be my own best friend
Me myself and I
Thats all I got in the end
Thats what I found out
And it aint no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on Im gon be my own best friend
Ive got me myself and I 
I know that I will never disappoint myself
My eyes have cried a thousand times 
All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
I cant regret time spent with you 
Yeah you hurt me but I learned a lot along the way
Its how I learned how to make it through 
After all the rain youll see the sun come out again
Now Ive got me myself and I
