Mine Lyrics
I've been watchin' for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh, my, oh, my
Been havin' conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feelin' like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're takin' this a little too far
If we are, we're takin' this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're takin' this a little too far
With me bein' wherever I'm at
Worried 'bout wherever you are
We're takin' this a little too far
We're takin' this a little too far
We're takin' this a little too far
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should, what's up?

On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holdin' back on this and let's get carried away

Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really askin' for is you
You're mine, you're mine (Yeah)
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
Long as you know who you belong to
You might also like
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should, what's up?

From eight until late, I think 'bout you
You own my nights, I don't know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep, yeah
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm askin' for but you
Stop makin' a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really askin' for is you
You're mine, you're mine (Yeah)
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
Long as you know who you belong to
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should, what's up?

(All I'm really askin' for)
(Long as you know who you belong to)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Pull up on you) I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me, I'ma go "Thriller" on you
I'ma just (Pull up on you)
I'ma let my hands do the talkin' when I see you, baby girl
I miss feelin' on you (Pull up on you)
I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you, that's just how I feel about you (Pull up on you)
Been about you and I'm still about you, but
We ain't finished talkin' (Pull up on you)
I told you you don't need to worry 'bout them bitches
All them fives need to listen when a ten is talkin' (Pull up on you)
'Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them
And, girl, you swear they all your friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, this come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a runnin' back
But that nigga came runnin' back (Pull up on you)
And you tell me you done with that
And I believe it's true
Long as you know who you belong to

All I'm really askin' for is you
