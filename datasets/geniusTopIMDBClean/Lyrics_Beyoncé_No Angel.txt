TranslationsFran√ßaisNo Angel Lyrics
Baby, put your arms around me, tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble, but I know that's why you're stayin'

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

No, I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you lyin'?
I love you even more than who I thought you were before
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby, oh

Tell me, do you wanna ride? (Ride, ride, ride)
Tell me, do you wanna ride? (Ride)
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round
Ridin' 'round in that H-town
Keep those candles in your bed, no need for the spell
Stop actin' so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

Baby, put your arms around me, tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble, but I know that's why you're stayin'

Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
