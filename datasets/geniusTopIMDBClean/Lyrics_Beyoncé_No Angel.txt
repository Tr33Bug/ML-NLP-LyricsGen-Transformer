Baby put your arms around me tell me Im a problem
Know Im not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble but I know thats why youre stayin
Because youre no angel either baby
Cause youre no angel either baby
No Im not an angel either but at least Im trying
I know I drive you crazy but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesnt notice when you late or when you lyin
I love you even more than who I thought you were before
Cause youre no angel either baby
Cause youre no angel either baby
Cause youre no angel either baby
Cause youre no angel either baby oh
Tell me do you wanna ride  Ride ride ride 
Tell me do you wanna ride  Ride 
Ridin round
Ridin round
Ridin round
Ridin round in that Htown
Keep those candles in your bed no need for the spell
Stop actin so scared just do what I tell
First both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want yeah baby Ill bet it comes true
Baby put your arms around me tell me Im a problem
Know Im not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble but I know thats why youre stayin
Because youre no angel either baby
Cause youre no angel either baby
