I may be young but Im ready
To give you all my love

Dont slow it down just let it go
So in love Ill give it all away
Just dont tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight Ill do it every way
Speakers knockin til the morning light
Cause we like to party hey

Your touch is driving me crazy
I cant explain the way I feel
Top down with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close dont let me go
So in love I dont care what they say
I dont care if they talking tomorrow
Cause tonights the night ohohohoh

Music knockin til the morning light

Set the scene 3000 degrees
I aint worried about them   over there
But they worry about me

And another homeboy there  named Cheese

Spit this  for realo Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone elses hero
Man we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday thats the way every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them they never forgot
And nothing else really mean nothing to me

Move on there aint nothing to see
Pshh always something to saw

Cream like when Im loving you yeah
So in love Ill give it all away
Just dont tell nobody tomorrow
Cause tonights the night ohohohoh
That I give you everything
Music knocking til the morning light

You a bad girl and your friends bad too  Ooh 
We got the swag sauce she dripping swagu
