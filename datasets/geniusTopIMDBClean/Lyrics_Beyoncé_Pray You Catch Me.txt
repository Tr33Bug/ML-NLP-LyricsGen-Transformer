TranslationsEspaolItalianoEnglish
You can taste the dishonesty
Its all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even thats a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
Im prayin to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
Im prayin to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When its only in my memory it dont hit me quite the same
Maybe its a cause for concern but Im not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering  Whisper whisper 
I pray you catch me  Whisper whisper 
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me  Pray you 
Im praying you catch me
What are you doing my love
