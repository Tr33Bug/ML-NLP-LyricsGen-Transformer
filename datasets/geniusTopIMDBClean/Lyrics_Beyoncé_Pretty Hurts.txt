Ms Third Ward your first question
What is your aspiration in life
Oh well my aspiration in life would be
To be happy
Mama said Youre a pretty girl
Whats in your head it doesnt matter
Brush your hair fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time Im gonna take the crown
Without fallin down down down
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst
We try to fix something
But you cant fix what you cant see
Its the soul that needs a surgery
Blonder hair flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South Beach sugarfree
Vogue says thinner is better
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time Im gonna take the crown
Without fallin down down down


Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts  Pretty hurts 
We shine the light on whatevers worst
We try to fix something
But you cant fix what you cant see
Its the soul that needs the surgery
Aint got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pains inside and nobody frees you from your body
Its the soul its my soul that needs surgery
Its my soul that needs surgery 
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake faade leaves you in the dark
Youre left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatevers worst  Pretty hurts 
Perfection is a disease of a nation  Pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts  Pretty hurts 
We shine the light on whatevers worst
Tryna fix something  Pretty hurts 
But you cant fix what you cant see
Its the soul that needs a surgery
When youre alone all by yourself  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
And youre lyin in your bed  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
Reflection stares right into you  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
Are you happy with yourself  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
You stripped away the masquerade  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
The illusion has been shed  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
Are you happy with yourself  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
Are you happy with yourself  Pretty hurts pretty hurts 
Yeah yes  Ah ah ah
