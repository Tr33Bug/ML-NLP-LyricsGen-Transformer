I wish I could believe you then Ill be alright
But now everything you told me really dont apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And its all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I cant go on and pretend like
I havent tried to forget this
But Im much too full of resentment
Just cant seem to get over the way you hurt me
Dont know how you gave another who didnt mean a thing  Mean a thing  no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you and I know youve changed
As much as I wanna trust you I know it aint the same  It aint the same 
And its all because you lied
I only give you a hard time  Hard time 
Cause I cant go on and pretend like
I havent tried to forget this  Forget this 
But Im much too full of resentment  Im much too full of resentment 
I may never understand why
Im doin the best that I can and I
I tried and I tried to forget this  Forget this 
But Im much too full of resentment
You lied  Ill always remember feelin  You lied 
Like I was no good  You lied 
Like I couldnt do it for you  You lied 
Like your mistress could
And its all because you lied
Loved you more than ever  You lied 
More than my own life  You lied 
But that part of me I gave you  You lied 
It was sacrificed  Sacrificed 
And its all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
Cause I cant go on and pretend like  I cant go on and pretend like 
I tried and I tried to forget this  I tried and I tried and I tried 
But Im too damn full of resentment
I know she was attractive but I was here first
Been ridin with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you
I know youre probably thinkin Whats up with B
I been cryin for too long what did you do to me
I used to be so strong but now you took my soul
Im cryin cant stop cryin cant stop cryin
You couldve told me you wasnt happy
I know you didnt wanna hurt me
But look what youve done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes  You lied 
You lied  And see shes had half of me  You lied 
How could you lie  You lied
