Let me sit this ass on you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me  Watch me 
Thats mass appeal
Dont take your eyes dont take your eyes off it
Watch it babe
If you like you can touch it baby
Do you do you wanna touch it baby
Ooh grab a hold dont let go
Let me know that you ready  Ready ready 
I just wanna show you now slow it down go around
You rock hard I rock steady
And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak baby peak baby peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep baby deep baby deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me baby me baby me
Rock it til water falls
Rock it til water falls
Rock it til water falls
Bathe in these waterfalls uh
I do it like its my profession
I gotta make a confession
Im proud of all this bass
Baby Ill put it in your face
By the way if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine inner peace entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls


So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak baby peak baby peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep baby deep baby deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me baby me baby me
Hard rock steady rock
Hard rock steady rock
Hard rock steady rock
Hard rock steady

Life has a reason
Swimming in my love  Your love  your love lifting
