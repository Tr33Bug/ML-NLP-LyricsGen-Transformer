We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away oh
And although I promised that I couldnt stay baby
Every promise dont work out that way oh babe
Every promise dont work out that way
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I cant erase baby
When every promise dont work out that way no no babe
When every promise dont work out that way
And your heart is broken cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I wont walk away oh
And I know I promised that I couldnt stay baby
Every promise dont work out that way no no no no no
Every promise dont work out that way
