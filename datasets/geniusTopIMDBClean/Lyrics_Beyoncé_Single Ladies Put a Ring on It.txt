TranslationsPortugusSingle Ladies  Put a Ring on It  Lyrics
All the single ladies  All the single ladies 
All the single ladies  All the single ladies 
All the single ladies  All the single ladies 
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Up in the club  club  just broke up  up 
Im doing my own little thing
Decided to dip  dip  but now you wanna trip  trip 
Cause another brother noticed me
Im up on him  him  he up on me  me 
Dont pay him any attention
Cried my tears  tears  for three good years  years 
You cant be mad at me
Cause if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Dont be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Cause if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Dont be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
I got gloss on my lips  lips  a man on my hips  hips 
Hold me tighter than my Deron jeans
Acting up  up  drink in my cup  cup 
I cant care less what you think
I need no permission did I mention
Dont pay him any attention
Cause you had your turn  turn 
But now you gon learn
What it really feels like to miss me
Cause if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Dont be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Cause if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Dont be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh


Dont treat me to the things of the world
Im not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer what I deserve
Heres a man that makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say Im the one you want
If you dont youll be alone
And like a ghost Ill be gone
All the single ladies  All the single ladies 
All the single ladies  All the single ladies 
All the single ladies  All the single ladies 
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh ohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Cause if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Dont be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa oh oh oh
Cause if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Dont be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa oh oh
