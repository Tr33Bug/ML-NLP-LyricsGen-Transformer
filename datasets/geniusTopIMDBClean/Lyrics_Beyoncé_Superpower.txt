When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different from when your hands are in mine
Thats just the way it is yeah
And when my voice is screamin out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now thats just the way it is
And when Im standin in this mirror after all these years
What Im viewings a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didnt see myself before you
Movin forward
Superpower 
A subtle power  Superpower 
A tough love  Superpower 
Oh like a shark  Superpower 
Ooh like a bear a tough love
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us without us without us without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
It couldnt slow us down
And I thought I could live without you
Hey hey
Cause nothing I know can break us down
They cant break us down
And just like you I cant be scared
And just like you I hope Im spared
But its tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know its there
Tough love  Superpower 
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky and what falls
Its a superpower  Superpower 
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty superpower


Superpower 
A subtle power  Superpower 
A tough love  Superpower 
Oh like a shark  Superpower 
Ooh too much to bear  Superpower 
And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us without us without us without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
They couldnt slow us down
And I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
And nothing I know couldnt break us down
They couldnt break us down
Yes we can
Couldnt break us down
They couldnt break us down
Yes we can
Couldnt break us down
They couldnt break us down
Yes we can
Couldnt break us down  We can make it baby 
They couldnt break us down
Yes we can
Couldnt break us down
They couldnt break us down down
