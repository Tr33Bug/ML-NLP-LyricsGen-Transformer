Upgrade U Lyrics
He-he-he...
Yeah, B!
Talk yo' shit! Ha-ha-ha
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
How you gon' upgrade me?
What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block
(Partner, let me upgrade you)
Ha-ha-ha
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep 'em on a leash, though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sendin' me a drink ain't appeasin', believe me (Believe me)
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
And I'ma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Believe me (Ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (That's a good look)
And anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Believe me (Ladies, that's a good look)

Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars-Piguet you
Switch your necktie to purple labels
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
You might also like
I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still played my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
I can help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Believe me (Ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (That's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Hey, believe me, I can upgrade you (Ladies, that's a good look)

Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you (Audemars Piguet you)
Switch your necktie to purple labels (Have you rockin' purple labels)
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you (Hey)
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you
(Uh, Hov, uh-huh, Hov)
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
(Uh huh)
I be's the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talkin' spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me, they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island-hoppin' off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars, this is high-level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (He-he-he....)

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevatin' with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes a diamond really shine
And you already is a star but, unless you flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you (Whoo)
Switch your necktie to purple labels
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)

Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in your necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond-cream facials
VVS cufflinks, six-star pent suites
Partner, let me upgrade you, grade you
Partner, partner, let me upgrade you, grade you
Let me, let me, let me upgrade you, grade you
Partner, partner, partner, let me upgrade you, ha31Embed
