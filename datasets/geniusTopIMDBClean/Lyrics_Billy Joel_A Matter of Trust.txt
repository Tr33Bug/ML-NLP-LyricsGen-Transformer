One two
One two three four
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will its just a question of when
Ive lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that wont happen to us
Cause its always been a matter of trust
I know youre an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
But I cant offer you proof
But youre gonna face a moment of truth
Its hard when youre always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
Its a matter of trust
You cant go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for Gods sake dont shut me out
This time youve got nothing to lose
You can take it you can leave it whatever you choose
I wont hold back anything
And Ill walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
Its make believe until its only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust
Im sure youre aware love
Weve both had our share of
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong
Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After youve heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But that cant happen to us
Cause its always been a matter of trust
Its a matter of trust
Its always been a matter of trust
Its a matter of trust
Cause its always been a matter of trust
