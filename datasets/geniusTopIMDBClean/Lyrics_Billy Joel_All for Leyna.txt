She stood on the tracks waving her arms
Leading me to that third rail shock
Quick as a wink she changed her mind
She gave me a night thats all it was
What will it take until I stop
Kidding myself wasting my time
Whoa
Theres nothing else I can do
cause Im doing it all for Leyna
I dont want anyone new
cause Im living it all for Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
cause Im giving it all to Leyna
We laid on the beach watching the tide
She didnt tell me there were rocks
Under the waves right off the shore
Washed up on the sand barely alive
Wishing the undertow would stop
How can a man take anymore
Whoa
Theres nothing else I can do
cause Im doing it all for Leyna
I dont want anyone new
cause Im living it all for Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
cause Im giving it all to Leyna
Im failing in school losing my friends
Making my family lose their minds
I dont want to eat I dont want to sleep
I only want Leyna one more time
Now Im in my room watching the tube
Telling myself she still may drop
Over to say shes changed her mind
So I wait in the dark listening for her
Instead of my old man saying
Stop kidding yourself wasting your time
Whoa
Theres nothing else I can do
cause Im doing it all for Leyna
I dont want anyone new
cause Im living it all for Leyna
Theres nothing in it for you
cause Im giving it all to Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
All for Leyna
