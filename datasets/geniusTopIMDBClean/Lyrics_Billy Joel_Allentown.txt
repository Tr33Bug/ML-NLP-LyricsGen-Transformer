Well were living here in Allentown
And theyre closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem theyre killing time
Filling out forms standing in line
Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance danced with them slow
And were living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And its getting very hard to stay
Well were waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard if we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke chromium steel
And were waiting here in Allentown
But theyve taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away
Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened
On the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face
Well Im living here in Allentown
And its hard to keep a good man down
But I wont be getting up today
And its getting very hard to stay
And were living here in Allentown
