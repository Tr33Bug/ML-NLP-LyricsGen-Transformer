Some people stay far away from the door
If theres a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by
Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie
I know youre only protecting yourself
I know youre thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you
But Im not above making up for the love
Youve been denying you could ever feel
Im not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can
Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
Im only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before
Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that its easier to hate
Then to wait anymore
I know you dont wanna hear what I say
I know youre gonna keep turning away
But Ive been there


And if I can survive I can keep you alive
Im not above going through it again
Im not above being cool for a while
If youre cruel to me Ill understand
Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man
You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess youd rather be a martyr tonight
Thats your decision
But Im not below anybody I know
If theres a chance of resurrecting a love
Im not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began
Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But Im not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man
I am an innocent man
Oh yes I am
An innocent man
Oh ho ho ho
