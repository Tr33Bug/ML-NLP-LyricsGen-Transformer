Well you went uptown
Ridin in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon
In your hand
And the spoon up your nose
Ooh and when you
Wake up in the mornin
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But dont come bitchin to me
Because you had to be
A big shot didnt cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot didnt cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word last night
You know what everythings about
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night whoa
Yeah
And they were all impressed
With your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaines
And the story of your latest success
You kept em so entertained
But now you just dont
Remember all the things you said
And youre not sure that you want to know
Ill give you one hint honey
You sure did put on a show
Yes yes you had to be
A big shot didnt cha
You had to prove it to the crowd
You had to be a big shot didnt cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word last night
Youre so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page bold type
You had to be a big shot last night


Well its no big sin
To stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldnt see it was time to go home
No no no no no no
You had to be a big shot didnt cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot didnt cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word last night
Youre so much fun to be around
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night
Big shot
Big shot
Oh big shot
Big shot
