Saturday night and youre still hanging around
Youre tired of living in your one horse town
Youd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while
Mmhmm
So you go to the Village in your
Tiedye jeans
And you stare at the junkies
And the closet queens
Its like some pornographic magazine
And you smile
Mmhmm

And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and youll be smiling
Oh yeah yeah
Your sisters gone out shes on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon
But you just cant wait
For that call

New English clothes
And you look so polished
From your hair down to your toes
Oh but still your fingers
Gonna pick your nose

Mmhmm yeah
But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and youll be smiling

And your brand new Chevrolet

In the swimming pool
And you guess you wont be goin back to school

And take you to your special island

And you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parkin lot
Ohh but still youre aching for the things you havent got
What went wrong
