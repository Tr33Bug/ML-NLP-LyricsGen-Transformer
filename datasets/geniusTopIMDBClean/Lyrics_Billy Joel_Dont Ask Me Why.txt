All the waiters in your grand caf
Leave their tables when you blink
Ohh every dog must have his every day
Every drunk must have his drink
Dont wait for answers
Just take your chances
Dont ask me why
All your life you had to stand in line
Still youre standing on your feet
Ohh all your choices made you change your mind
Now your calendars complete
Dont wait for answers
Just take your chances
Dont ask me why
Mmm you can say the human heart
Is only makebelieve
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as Im a victim of desire
All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can tell
Youre no stranger to the street
Dont ask for favors
Dont talk to strangers
Dont ask me why
Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you Parlezvous franais 
Dont look for answers
You took your chances
Dont ask me why
Dont ask me why
