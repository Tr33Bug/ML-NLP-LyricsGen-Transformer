Baby all the lights are turned on you
Now youre in the center of the stage
Evrything revolves on what you do
Ah you are in your prime youve come of age
You can always have your way somehow
Because everybody loves you now
You can walk away from your mistakes
You can turn your back on what you do
Just a little smile is all it takes
And you can have your cake and eat it too
Loneliness will get to you somehow
But everybody loves you now
Ah they all want your white body
And they await your reply
Ah but between you and me
And the Staten Island ferry
So do I
All the people want to know your name
Soon there will be lines outside your door
Feelings do not matter in your game
Because nothings gonna touch you anymore
So your life is only living anyhow
And everybody loves you now
Close your eyes when you dont want to see
And stay at home when you dont want to go
Only speak to those who will agree
Yeah and close your mind when you dont want to know


You have lost your innocence somehow
But everybody loves you now
Ah you know that nothing lasts forever
And its all been done before
Ah but you aint got the time
To go to Cold Spring Harbor
No more
See how all the people gather around
Hey isnt it a thrill to see them crawl
Keep your eyes ahead and dont look down
Yeah and lock yourself inside your sacred wall
This is what you wanted aint you proud
Because everybody loves you now
