Call me a joker call me a fool
Right at this moment Im totally cool
Clear as a crystal sharp as a knife
I feel like Im in the prime of my life
Sometimes it feels like Im going too fast
I dont know how long
This feeling will last
Maybe its only tonight
Darling I dont know
Why I go to extremes
Too high or too low
There aint no inbetweens
And if I stand or I fall
Its all or nothing at all
Darling I dont know
Why I go to extremes
Sometimes Im tired sometimes Im shot
Sometimes I dont know
How much more Ive got
Maybe Im headed over the hill
Maybe Ive set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much
Do you think you can take
Until the heart in you
Is starting to break
Sometimes it feels like it will
Darling I dont know
Why I go to extremes
Too high or too low
There aint no inbetweens
You can be sure when Im gone
I wont be out there too long
Darling I dont know
Why I go to extremes
Out of the darkness into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either Im wrong
Or Im perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes
And if I stand or I fall
Its all or nothing at all
Darling I dont know
Why I go to extremes
Oh I dont know
Why I go to extremes
Too high or too low
There aint no inbetweens
You can be sure when Im gone
I wont be out there too long
Darling I dont know
Why I go to extremes
I dont know why
I dont know why
I dont know why
I dont know why
I dont know why
I dont know why
Out of the dark into the lights
Either Im wrong
Or Im perfectly right
I dont know why
