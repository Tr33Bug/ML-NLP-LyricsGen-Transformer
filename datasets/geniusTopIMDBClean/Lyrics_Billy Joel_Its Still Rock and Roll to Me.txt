Whats the matter with the clothes Im wearing
Cant you tell that your ties too wide
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin out lately honey
You cant dress trashy til you spend a lot of money
Everybodys talkin bout the new sound
Funny but its still rock and roll to me
Whats the matter with the car Im driving
Cant you tell that its out of style
Should I get a set of whitewall tires
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile
Nowadays you cant be too sentimental
Your best bets a true baby blue Continental
Hot funk cool punk even if its old junk
Its still rock and roll to me
Oh it doesnt matter what they say in the papers
Cause its always been the same old scene
Theres a new band in town but you cant get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Dont waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers
Next phase new wave dance craze anyways
Its still rock and roll to me
Alright Richie
Woo
Ooh
Whats the matter with the crowd Im seeing
Dont you know that theyre out of touch
Should I try to be a straight A student
If you are then you think too much
Dont you know about the new fashion honey
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money
Its the next phase new wave
Dance craze anyways
Its still rock and roll to me
Everybodys talkin bout the new sound
Funny but its still rock and roll to me
