James LyricsJames, we were always friends
From our childhood days
And we made our plans
And we had to go our sep'rate ways
I went on the road
You pursued an education
James, do you like your life?
Can you find release?
And will you ever change?
Will you ever write your masterpiece?
Are you still in school?
Living up to expectations?
James, you were so relied upon
Everybody knows how hard you tried
Hey - oh, look at what a job you've done
Carrying the weight of family pride
James, you've been well behaved
You've been working hard
But will you always stay
Someone else's dream of who you are?
Do what's good for you
Or you're not good for anybody
James
I went on the road
You pursued an education
James, how you gonna know for sure?
Everything was so well organized
Hey, oh now everything is so secure
And everybody else is satisfied

Can you find release?
And will you ever change?
When will you write your masterpiece?
Do what's good for you
Or you're not good for anybody
