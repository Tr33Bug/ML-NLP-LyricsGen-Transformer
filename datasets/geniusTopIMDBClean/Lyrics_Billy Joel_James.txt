James we were always friends
From our childhood days
And we made our plans
And we had to go our seprate ways
I went on the road
You pursued an education
James do you like your life
Can you find release
And will you ever change
Will you ever write your masterpiece
Are you still in school
Living up to expectations
James you were so relied upon
Everybody knows how hard you tried
Hey  oh look at what a job youve done
Carrying the weight of family pride
James youve been well behaved
Youve been working hard
But will you always stay
Someone elses dream of who you are
Do whats good for you
Or youre not good for anybody
James
I went on the road
You pursued an education
James how you gonna know for sure
Everything was so well organized
Hey oh now everything is so secure
And everybody else is satisfied
James do you like your life
Can you find release
And will you ever change
When will you write your masterpiece
Do whats good for you
Or youre not good for anybody
James
