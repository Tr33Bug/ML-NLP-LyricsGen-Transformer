Just the Way You Are Lyrics
Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before, mmm
And don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mmm-hmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are
Don't go tryin' some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mmm-hmm-hmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard, mmm-hmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

Need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Oh, what will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?

I said, “I love you,” that's forever
And this, I promise from the heart, mmm-hmm-hmm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are

Alright
You might also like
I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard, mmm-hmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are, oh10Embed
