Dont go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before mmm
And dont imagine youre too familiar
And I dont see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far mmmhmm
I took the good times Ill take the bad times
I take you just the way you are
Dont go tryin some new fashion
Dont change the color of your hair mmmhmmhmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
I dont want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard mmmhmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
Need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Oh what will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you
I said I love you thats forever
And this I promise from the heart mmmhmmhmm
I couldnt love you any better
I love you just the way you are
Alright


I dont want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard mmmhmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are oh
