If it seems like Ive been lost in lets remember
If you think Im feelin older and missin my younger days ohoh
Then you should have known me much better
Cause my past is somethin that never got in my way oh no
Still I would not be here now if I never had the hunger
And Im not ashamed to say the wild boys were my friends oh
Cause I never felt the desire
Til their music set me on fire
And then I was saved yeah
Thats why Im keepin the faith
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Keepin the faith
We wore matador boots only Flagg Brothers had em with a Cuban heel
Iridescent socks with the same color shirt and a tight pair of chinos
Oh I put on my shark skin jacket you know the kind with the velvet collar
And dittybop shades oh yeah
I took a fresh pack of Luckies and a mint called SenSen
My old mans Trojans and his Old Spice aftershave oh
Combed my hair in a pompadour like the rest of the Romeos wore
A permanent wave yeah
We were keepin the faith
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Keepin the faith
You can get just so much from the good thing
You can linger too long in your dreams
Say goodbye to the oldies but goodies
Cause the good ol days werent always good
And tomorrow aint as bad as it seems


Learned stickball as a formal education
Lost a lot of fights but it taught me how to lose okay oh
I heard about sex but not enough
I found you could dance and still look tough anyway
Oh yes I did
I found out a man aint just bein macho
Ate an awful lot of late night drivein food drank a lot of take home pay
I thought I was the Duke of Earl
When I made it with a redhaired girl in a Chevrolet
Oh yeah
We were keepin the faith
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Keepin the faith
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You know the good ol days werent always good
And tomorrow aint as bad as it seems
I told you my reasons for the whole revival
Now Im goin outside to have an ice cold beer in the shade oh
Im going to listen to my 45s
Aint it wonderful to be alive when the rock n roll plays yeah
When the memory stays yeah
Im keepin the faith
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Keepin the faith
Im keepin the faith yes I am
You know Im keepin the faith oh yes I am
You know Im keepin the faith oh you know I will
Im keepin the faith oh yeah
Ooh Im keepin the faith oh yeah
