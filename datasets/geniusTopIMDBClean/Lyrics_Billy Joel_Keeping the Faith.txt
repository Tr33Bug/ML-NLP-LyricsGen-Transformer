Keeping the Faith Lyrics
If it seems like I've been lost in "let's remember"
If you think I'm feelin' older and missin' my younger days, oh-oh
Then you should have known me much better
'Cause my past is somethin' that never got in my way, oh no

Still I would not be here now if I never had the hunger
And I'm not ashamed to say the wild boys were my friends, oh
'Cause I never felt the desire
'Til their music set me on fire
And then I was saved, yeah
That's why I'm keepin' the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keepin' the faith

We wore matador boots, only Flagg Brothers had 'em with a Cuban heel
Iridescent socks with the same color shirt and a tight pair of chinos
Oh, I put on my shark skin jacket, you know the kind with the velvet collar
And ditty-bop shades, oh yeah

I took a fresh pack of Luckies and a mint called Sen-Sen
My old man's Trojans and his Old Spice aftershave, oh
Combed my hair in a pompadour like the rest of the Romeos wore
A permanent wave, yeah

We were keepin' the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keepin' the faith

You can get just so much from the good thing
You can linger too long in your dreams
Say goodbye to the oldies but goodies
'Cause the good ol' days weren't always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems
You might also like
Learned stickball as a formal education
Lost a lot of fights but it taught me how to lose okay, oh
I heard about sex but not enough
I found you could dance and still look tough anyway
Oh yes I did

I found out a man ain't just bein' macho
Ate an awful lot of late night drive-in food, drank a lot of take home pay
I thought I was the Duke of Earl
When I made it with a red-haired girl in a Chevrolet
Oh, yeah

We were keepin' the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keepin' the faith

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You know the good ol' days weren't always good
And tomorrow ain't as bad as it seems
I told you my reasons for the whole revival
Now I'm goin' outside to have an ice cold beer in the shade, oh
I'm going to listen to my 45's
Ain't it wonderful to be alive when the rock 'n' roll plays, yeah
When the memory stays, yeah

I'm keepin' the faith
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Keepin' the faith

I'm keepin' the faith, yes I am
You know I'm keepin' the faith, oh yes I am
You know I'm keepin' the faith, oh you know I will
I'm keepin' the faith, oh yeah!
Ooh I'm keepin' the faith, oh yeahEmbed
