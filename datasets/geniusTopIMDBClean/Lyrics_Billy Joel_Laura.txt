Laura calls me
In the middle of the night
Passes on her
Fateful information
Then these careless fingers
They get caught in her vise
Till theyre bleeding
On my coffee table
Living alone isnt all that its cracked up to be
Oh oh oh
Im on her side why does she push the poison on me
Oh oh oh oh
Laura has a very hard time
All her life has
Been one long disaster
Then she tells me
She suddenly believes
Shes seen a very good sign
Shell be taking
Some aggressive action
I fight her wars while shes slamming her doors in my face
Oh oh oh
Failure to break was the only mistake that she made
Oh oh oh oh
Here I am feeling like a fucking fool
Do I react the way exactly she intends me to
Every time I think Im off the hook
She makes me lose my cool
Im her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura calls me
When she needs a good fix  ah 
All her questions
Will get sympathetic answers
I should be so immunized
To all of her tricks  ah 
Shes surviving
On her second chances


Sometimes I feel like this godfather deal is all wrong
Oh oh oh
How can she hold an umbilical chord for so long
Oh oh oh oh
Ive done everything I can
What else am I supposed to do
Im her machine
And she can punch all the keys
She can push any button I was programmed through
Laura  Laura  loves me  loves me 
Even if I dont care
Thats my problem
Thats her sacred absolution
If she had to
She would put herself in my chair  self in my chair ah 
Even though I faced electrocution
She always says Im the best friend that shes ever had
Oh oh oh
How do you hang up on someone who needs you that bad
Oh oh oh oh
