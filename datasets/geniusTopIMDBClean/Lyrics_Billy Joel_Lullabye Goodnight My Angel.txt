Lullabye  Goodnight My Angel  Lyrics
Goodnight my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what
Youve been asking me
I think you know
What Ive been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away
Goodnight my angel
Now its time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs
You sang for me
When we went sailing
On an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
Im rocking you to sleep
The waters dark
And deep inside this ancient heart
Youll always be a part of me
Goodnight my angel
Now its time to dream
And dream how wonderful
Your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullaby
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me
Someday well all be gone
But lullabies go on and on
They never die
Thats how you
And I will be
