Movin Out  Anthonys Song  Lyrics
Hooooh
Ohhohh
Mmmmmm
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said Sonny move out to the country
Ah but workin too hard can give you a heart attack
Ackackackackack
You oughta know by now
You oughta know by now 
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money
And it seems such a waste of time
If thats what its all about
Mama if thats movin up then Im
Movin out
Im movin out mmm mm
Oohooh uhhuh mmm
Sergeant OLeary is walkin the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr Cacciatores
Down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah and hes tradin in his Chevy
For a Cadillacacacacacac
You oughta know by now
You oughta know by now 
And if he cant drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
And it seems such a waste of time
If thats what its all about
Mama if thats movin up then Im movin out
Mmm Im movin out
Ohohh ooh ooh uhhuh mmm
You should never argue
With a crazy mindmindmindmind
You oughta know by now
You oughta know by now 
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money
And if thats what you have in mind
Yeah if thats what youre all about
Good luck movin up cause Im movin out
Im movin out
Im movin out
