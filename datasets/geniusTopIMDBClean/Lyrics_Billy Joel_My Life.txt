Got a call from an old friend we used to be real close
Said he couldnt go on the American way
Closed the shop sold the house bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a standup routine in LA
I dont need you to worry for me cause Im alright
I dont want you to tell me its time to come home
I dont care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said you had to 
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I never said 
I still belong  Still belong 
Dont get me wrong  Get me wrong 
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time
They will tell you you cant sleep alone in a strange place
Then theyll tell you you cant sleep with somebody else
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way its okay you wake up with yourself
I dont need you to worry for me cause Im alright
I dont want you to tell me its time to come home
I dont care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said you had to 
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
Of circumstance 


I still belong  Still belong 
Dont get me wrong  Get me wrong 
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time
I dont care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone
Keep it to yourself its my life
Keep it to yourself its my life
Keep it to yourself its my life
Keep it to yourself its my life
