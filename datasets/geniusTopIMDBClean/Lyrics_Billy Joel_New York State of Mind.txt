Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But Im taking a Greyhound
On the Hudson River line
Im in a New York state of mind
Mmhmmh 
Ive seen all the movie stars
In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies
Under the evergreens
I know what Im needing
And I dont want to waste more time
Im in a New York state of mind
Mmhmmh 
It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times the Daily News
It comes down to reality
And its fine with me cause Ive let it slide
I dont care if its Chinatown or on Riverside
I dont have any reasons I left them all behind
Im in a New York state of mind
Mmhmmh oh yeah
