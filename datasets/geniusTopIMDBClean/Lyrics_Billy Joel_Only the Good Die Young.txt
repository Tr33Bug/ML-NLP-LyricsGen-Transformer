Come out Virginia dont let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw but sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well they showed you a statue told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aw but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
Well only the good die young
Thats what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We aint too pretty we aint too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aw but that never hurt no one
So come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal Ill throw you the line
The stainedglass curtain youre hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling only the good die young
Oh oh oh oh ohh
I tell ya only the good die young
Only the good die young
You got a nice white dress
And a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm and a cross of gold
But Virginia
They didnt give you quite enough information
You didnt count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
They say theres a heaven for those who will wait
Some say its better but I say it aint
Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
You know that only the good die young
Oh oh ohh baby
I tell ya only the good die young
Only the good die young

You said your mother told you
All that I could give you was a reputation
Aw she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me
Oh oh oh
Come out come out come out Virginia dont let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
You know that only the good die young
Tell you baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
Ooh ooh oooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh
