Theres a place in the world for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend he refuses to crawl
And hes always at home with his back to the wall
And hes proud of his scars and the battles hes lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
Give a moment or two to the angry young man
With his foot in his mouth and his heart in his hand
Hes been stabbed in the back hes been misunderstood
Its a comfort to know his intentions are good
And he sits in a room with a lock on the door
With his maps and his medals laid out on the floor
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
I believe Ive passed the age
Of consciousness and righteous rage
I found that just surviving was a noble fight
I once believed in causes too
I had my pointless point of view
And life went on no matter who was wrong or right
Oh theres always a place for the angry young man
With his fist in the air and his head in the sand
And hes never been able to learn from mistakes
So he cant understand why his heart always breaks
And his honor is pure and his courage as well
And hes fair and hes true and hes boring as hell
And hell go to the grave as an angry old man
Yes theres always a place for the angry young man
With his working class ties and his radical plans
He refuses to bend he refuses to crawl
And hes always at home with his back to the wall
And hes proud of his scars and the battles hes lost
And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross
And he likes to be known as the angry young man
