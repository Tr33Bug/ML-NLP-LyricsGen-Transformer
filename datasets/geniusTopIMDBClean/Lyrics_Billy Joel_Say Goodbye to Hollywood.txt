Say Goodbye to Hollywood Lyrics
Bobby's driving through the city tonight
Through the lights in a hot new rent-a-car
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine
It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Johnny's taking care of things for awhile
And his style is so right for troubadours
They got him sitting with his back to the door
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby

Moving on is a chance that you take
Every time you try to stay together
Say a word out of line and you find
That the friends you had are gone forever
Forever

So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last, some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hello's and goodbye's
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
You might also like
Moving on is a chance that you take
Every time you try to stay together
Say a word out of line and you find
That the friends you had are gone forever
Forever

So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last, some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hello's and goodbyes
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again

Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, my babyEmbed
