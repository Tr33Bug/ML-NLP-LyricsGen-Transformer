Bobbys driving through the city tonight
Through the lights in a hot new rentacar
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine
Its a scene down on Sunset Boulevard
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Johnnys taking care of things for awhile
And his style is so right for troubadours
They got him sitting with his back to the door
Now he wont be my fast gun anymore
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Moving on is a chance that you take
Every time you try to stay together
Say a word out of line and you find
That the friends you had are gone forever
Forever
So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
Im afraid its time for goodbye again
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Moving on is a chance that you take
Every time you try to stay together
Say a word out of line and you find
That the friends you had are gone forever
Forever
So many faces in and out of my life
Some will last some will just be now and then
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes
Im afraid its time for goodbye again
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
Say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye my baby
