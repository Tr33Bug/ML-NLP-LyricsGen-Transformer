She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals
What she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But shes always a woman to me
She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But shell never believe you
And shell take what you give her
As long as its free
Yeah she steals like a thief
But shes always a woman to me
Oh she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
Shes ahead of her time
Oh and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind
And shell promise you more
Than the Garden of Eden
Then shell carelessly cut you
And laugh while youre bleedin
But shell bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
Cause shes always a woman to me
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mm
Oh she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
Shes ahead of her time
Oh and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind


She is frequently kind
And shes suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
Shes nobodys fool
But she cant be convicted
Shes earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
But shes always a woman to me
Mmm mm mmm mm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
