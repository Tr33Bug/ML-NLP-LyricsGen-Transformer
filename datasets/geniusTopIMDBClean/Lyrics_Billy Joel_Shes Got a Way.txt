Shes got a way about her
I dont know what it is
But I know that I cant live without her
Shes got a way of pleasing
I dont know what it is
But there doesnt have to be a reason anyway
Shes got a smile that heals me
I dont know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
And shes got a way of talking
I dont know what it is
But it lifts me up
When we are walking anywhere
She comes to me when Im feelin down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
Shes got a way of showing
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on going
And shes got a light around her
And everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love
Surround her everywhere
She comes to me when Im feelin down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
Oh woo oh oh
Shes got a smile that heals me
I dont know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
Shes got a way about her
I dont know what it is
But I know that I cant live without her anyway
