Sheâ€™s Got a Way Lyrics
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
She's got a way of pleasing
I don't know what it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason anyway

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
And she's got a way of talking
I don't know what it is
But it lifts me up
When we are walking anywhere
She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around

She's got a way of showing
How I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on going
And she's got a light around her
And everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love
Surround her everywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around
Oh woo oh oh

She's got a smile that heals me
I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me
She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her anywayYou might also likeEmbed
