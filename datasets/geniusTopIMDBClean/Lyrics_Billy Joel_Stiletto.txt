She cuts you once she cuts you twice
But still you believe
The wound is so fresh
You can taste the blood
But you dont have strength to leave
Youve been bought youve been sold
Youve been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleading
With your insides bleeding
Cause you deep down want some more
When she says she wants forgiveness
Its such a clever masquerade
Shes so good with her stiletto
You dont even see the blade
You dont even see the blade
She cuts you hard she cuts you deep
Shes got so much skill
Shes so fascinating
That youre still there waiting
When she comes back for the kill
Youve been slashed in the face
Youve been left there to bleed
You want to run away
But you know youre gonna stay
Cause she gives you what you need
Then she says she needs affection
While she searches for the vein
Shes so good with her stiletto
You dont really mind the pain
You dont mind the pain
Oh
She cuts you out she cuts you down
She carves up your life
But you wont do nothing
As she keeps on cutting
Cause you know you love the knife
Youve been bought youve been sold
Youve been locked outside the door
But you stand there pleading
With your insides bleeding
Cause you deep down want some more
Then she says she needs affection
While she searches for the vein
Shes so good with her stiletto
You dont really mind the pain
You dont mind the pain
