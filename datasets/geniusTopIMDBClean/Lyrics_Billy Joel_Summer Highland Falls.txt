They say that these are not the best of times
But theyre the only times Ive ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation
In cathedrals of our own
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lovers eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
Its either sadness or euphoria
So well argue and well compromise
And realize that nothings ever changed
For all our mutual experience
Our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason coexists with our insanity
And though we choose between reality and madness
Its either sadness or euphoria
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we dont fulfill each others fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our respective similarities
Its either sadness or euphoria
Whoa whoa
