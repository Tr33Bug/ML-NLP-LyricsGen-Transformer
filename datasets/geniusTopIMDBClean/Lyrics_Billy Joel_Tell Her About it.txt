Listen boy I dont want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I dont like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made
Shes a real nice girl and shes always there for you
But a nice girl wouldnt tell you what you should do
Oh listen boy Im sure that you think you got it all under control
You dont want somebody telling you the way to stay in someones soul
Youre a big boy now and youll never let her go
But thats just the kind of thing she ought to know
Tell her about it tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that youre for real
Tell her about it tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her let her know how much she means
Listen boy its not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself youve got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone youre always insecure
And theres only one good way to reassure
Tell her about it let her know how much you care
When she cant be with you tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it every day before you leave
Pay her some attention give her something to believe
Cause now and then shell get to worrying
Just because you havent spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when shes gone


Listen boy its good information from a man whos made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes
Shes a trusting soul shes put her trust in you
But a girl like that wont tell you what you should do
Tell her about it tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that youre for real
Tell her about it tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her let her know how much she means
Tell her about it tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it the girl dont want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it tell her now and you wont go wrong
You got to tell her about it before it gets too late
Youve got to tell her about it
You know the girl dont want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell tell tell her about it
Now tell her about it
