Well Im on the downeaster Alexa
And Im cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound
We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay
Like all the locals here Ive had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I work my fingers to the bone
So I could own my downeaster Alexa
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain cant fall asleep
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know theres fish out there but where God only knows
They say these waters arent what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me
So if you see my downeaster Alexa
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel
Yayo
Yayo
Yayo
Yayyayo
Now I drive my downeaster Alexa
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they told me I cant sell no stripers
And theres no luck in swordfishing here
I was a bayman like my father was before
Cant make a living as a bayman anymore
There aint much future for a man who works the sea
But there aint no island left for islanders like me
Yayyayyayo
Yayyayyayo
Yayyayyayo
Yayyayyayo
