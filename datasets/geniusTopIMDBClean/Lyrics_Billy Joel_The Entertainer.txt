I am the entertainer
And I know just where I stand
Another serenader
And another longhaired band
Today I am your champion
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game youll forget my name
And I wont be here in another year
If I dont stay on the charts
I am the entertainer
I dress to fit the style
I wear all kinds of sparkles
I  flash the crowd my smile
And when the night is over
And I stand without my clothes
Perspiration stains and varicose veins
My eyes look shot
My bellys got a pot
And theres a pimple on my nose
I am the entertainer
And Ive had to pay my price
The things I did not know at first
I learned by doin twice
Ah but still they come to haunt me
Still they want their say
So Ive learned to dance
With a hand in my pants
Let em rub my neck and I write em a check
And they go their merry way
I am the entertainer
Been all around the world
Ive played all kinds of palaces
And laid all kinds of girls
I cant remember faces
I dont remember names
Ah but what the hell
You know its just as well
Cause after a while and a thousand miles
It all becomes the same
I am the entertainer
I bring to you my songs
Id like to spend a day or two
But I cant stay that long
No Ive got to meet expenses
I got to stay in line
Gotta get those fees to the agencies
And Id love to stay but theres bills to pay
So I just dont have the time
I am the entertainer I come to do my show
Youve heard my latest record
Its been on the radio
Ah it took me years to write it
They were the best years of my life
It was a beautiful song but it ran too long
If youre gonna have a hit
You gotta make it fit
So they cut it down to 305
I am the entertainer
The idol of my age
I make all kinds of money
When I go on the stage
Ah youve seen me in the papers
Ive been in the magazines
But if I go cold I wont get sold
Ill get put in the back in the discount rack
Like another can of beans
I am the entertainer
And I know just where I stand
Another serenader
And another longhaired band
Today I am your champion
I may have won your hearts
But I know the game and youll forget my name
I wont be here in another year
If I dont stay on the charts
