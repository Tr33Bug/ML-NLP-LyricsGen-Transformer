Dum dum dum
Whoa oh oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
Whoa oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
Im so inspired by you
That hasnt happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
Thats where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I havent been there for the longest time
Whoa oh oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
Whoa oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest
Im that voice youre hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasnt happened for the longest time
Maybe this wont last very long
But you feel so right and I could be wrong
Maybe Ive been hoping too hard
But Ive gone this far and its more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further well go on
Maybe Ill be sorry when youre gone
Ill take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I havent been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
Youre wonderful so far and its more than I hoped for
I dont care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time
Whoa oh oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
Whoa oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
Whoa oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
Whoa oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
Whoa oh oh  For the longest 
For the longest time
