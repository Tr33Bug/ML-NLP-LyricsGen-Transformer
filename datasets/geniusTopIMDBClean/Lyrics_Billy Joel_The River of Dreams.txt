In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And its too hard to cross
And even though I know
The river is wide
I walk down every evening
And I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find
What Ive been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And Ive been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole
I dont know why I go walking at night
But now Im tired and I dont
Want to walk anymore
I hope it doesnt take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is
That Ive been looking for
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know Im searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
Im not sure about a life after this
God knows Ive never
Been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire
I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
Were all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night
Gloria its not Marie
