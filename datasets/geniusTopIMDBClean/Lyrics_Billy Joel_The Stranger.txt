Well we all have a face
That we hide away forever
And we take them out and show ourselves
When everyone has gone
Some are satin some are steel
Some are silk and some are leather
Theyre the faces of a stranger
But wed love to try them on
Well we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself
Dont be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
Youve done it
Why cant someone else
You should know by now
Youve been there yourself
Once I used to believe
I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes


Well we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised
That you never saw the stranger
Did you ever let your lover
See the stranger in yourself
Dont be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
Youve done it
Why cant someone else
You should know by now
Youve been there yourself
You may never understand
How the stranger is inspired
But he isnt always evil
And he is not always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions
You will never quench the fire
Youll give in to your desire
When the stranger comes along
Ooo ooo
Ooh ooh
