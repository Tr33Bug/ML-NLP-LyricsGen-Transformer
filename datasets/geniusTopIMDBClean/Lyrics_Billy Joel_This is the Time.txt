We walked on the beach beside that old hotel
Theyre tearin it down now but its just as well
I havent shown you everything a man can do
So stay with me baby
Ive got plans for you
This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
Cause we wont although well want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
Youve given me the best of you
But now I need the rest of you
Did you know that before you came into my life
It was some kind of miracle that I survived
Some day we will both look back
And have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime
And the aftermath
I know weve got to move somehow
But I dont want to lose you now
Sometimes its so easy
To let a day slip on by
Without even seeing each other at all
But this is the time youll turn back to and so will I
And those will be days you can never recall
And so we embrace again
Behind the dunes
This beach is so cold on winter afternoons
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun
Im warm from the memory of days to come
