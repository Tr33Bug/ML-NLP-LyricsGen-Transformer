Tomorrow Is Today Lyrics
I've been living for the moment
But I just can't have my way
And I'm afraid to go to sleep
Because tomorrow is today
People tell me life is sweeter
But I don't hear what they say
Nothing comes to change my life
So tomorrow is today

I don't care to know the hour
Because it's passing anyway
I don't have to see tomorrow
Because I saw it yesterday
So I listen for an answer
But the feeling seems to stay
And what's the use of always dreaming
If tomorrow is today
Still I'm waiting for the morning
But it feels so far away
And you don't need the love I'm giving
So tomorrow is today

Oh my, I'm going to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me
Make my bed, I'm gonna lie in it
If you don't come, I'm sure gonna die in it
Too late, too much giving
I've seen a lot of life
And I'm damn sick of living it
I keep hoping that you will pass my way
And someday if your dreams are leaving you
I'll still believe in you

I don't care to know the hour
Because it's passing anyway
I don't have to see tomorrow
Because I saw it yesterday
You might also like
Though I'm living and I'm singing
And although my hands still play
Soon enough it will all be over because
Tomorrow is today1Embed
