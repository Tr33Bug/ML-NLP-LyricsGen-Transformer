Ive been living for the moment
But I just cant have my way
And Im afraid to go to sleep
Because tomorrow is today
People tell me life is sweeter
But I dont hear what they say
Nothing comes to change my life
So tomorrow is today
I dont care to know the hour
Because its passing anyway
I dont have to see tomorrow
Because I saw it yesterday
So I listen for an answer
But the feeling seems to stay
And whats the use of always dreaming
If tomorrow is today
Still Im waiting for the morning
But it feels so far away
And you dont need the love Im giving
So tomorrow is today
Oh my Im going to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me
Make my bed Im gonna lie in it
If you dont come Im sure gonna die in it
Too late too much giving
Ive seen a lot of life
And Im damn sick of living it
I keep hoping that you will pass my way
And someday if your dreams are leaving you
Ill still believe in you
I dont care to know the hour
Because its passing anyway
I dont have to see tomorrow
Because I saw it yesterday


Though Im living and Im singing
And although my hands still play
Soon enough it will all be over because
Tomorrow is today
