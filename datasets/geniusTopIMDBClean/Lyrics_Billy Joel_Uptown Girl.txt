Uptown girl
Shes been living in her uptown world
I bet shes never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why
Im gonna try for an
Uptown girl
Shes been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now shes looking for a downtown man
Thats what I am
And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
Shell see Im not so tough
Just because Im in love with an
Uptown girl
You know Ive seen her in her uptown world
Shes getting tired of her high class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
Shes got a choice
Uptown girl
You know I cant afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
Shell understand what kind of guy Ive been
And then Ill win
And when shes walking shes looking so fine
And when shes talking shell say that shes mine
Shell say Im not so tough
Just because Im in love with an
Uptown girl
Shes been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now shes looking for a downtown man
Thats what I am
Uptown girl shes my uptown girl
You know Im in love with an uptown girl my uptown girl
You know Im in love with an uptown girl my uptown girl
You know Im in love with an uptown girl my uptown girl
You know Im in love with an uptown girl
