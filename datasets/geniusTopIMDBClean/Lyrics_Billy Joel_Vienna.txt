Slow down you crazy child
Youre so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if youre so smart
Tell me why are you still so afraid hmm
Wheres the fire whats the hurry about
Youd better cool it off before you burn it out
Youve got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day ayy
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
Youre gonna
Kick off before you even get halfway through ooh
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you
Slow down youre doin fine
You cant be everything you wanna be
Before your time
Although its so romantic
On the borderline tonight tonight
Too bad but its the life you lead
Youre so ahead of yourself
That you forgot what you need
Though you can see when youre wrong
You know you cant always see when youre right
Youre right
Youve got your passion
Youve got your pride
But dont you know
That only fools are satisfied
Dream on
But dont imagine theyll all come true ooh
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you
Slow down you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook
And disappear for a while
Its all right you can afford
To lose a day or two ooh
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you could just get old
Youre gonna
Kick off before you even get halfway through ooh
Why dont you realize
Vienna waits for you
When will you realize
Vienna waits for you
