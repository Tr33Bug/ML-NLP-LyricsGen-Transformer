Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said Im sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasnt hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change
Ive been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through BedfordStuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that Im insane
You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh but it just may be a lunatic
Youre looking for
Turn out the lights
Dont try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
Well remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If Im crazy then its true
That its all because of you
And you wouldnt want me any other way
You may be right
I may be crazy
Ho but it just may be a lunatic
Youre looking for
Its too late to fight
Its too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey but it just may be a lunatic
Youre looking for
Turn out the lights
Aww dont try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
You may be wrong
But you may be right
