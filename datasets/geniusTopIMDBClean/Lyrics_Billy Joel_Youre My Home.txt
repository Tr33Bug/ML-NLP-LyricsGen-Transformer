Youâ€™re My Home Lyrics
When you look into my eyes
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
It always comes as a surprise
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow
Well I never had a place
That I could call my very own
That's all right, my love
'Cause you're my home

When you touch my weary head
And you tell me everything will be all right
You say, "Use my body for your bed
And my love will keep you warm
Throughout the night"
Well I'll never be a stranger
And I'll never be alone
Wherever we're together, that's my home
Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Indiana's early morning dew
High up in the hills of California
Home is just another word for you
Well I never had a place
That I could call my very own
That's all right, my love
Cause you're my home

If I travel all my life
And I never get to stop and settle down
Long as I have you by my side
There's a roof above
And good walls all around
You're my castle, you're my cabin
And my instant pleasure dome
I need you in my house
Cause you're my home

You're my homeYou might also like2Embed
