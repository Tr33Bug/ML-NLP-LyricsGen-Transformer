When you look into my eyes
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
It always comes as a surprise
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow
Well I never had a place
That I could call my very own
Thats all right my love
Cause youre my home
When you touch my weary head
And you tell me everything will be all right
You say Use my body for your bed
And my love will keep you warm
Throughout the night
Well Ill never be a stranger
And Ill never be alone
Wherever were together thats my home
Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Indianas early morning dew
High up in the hills of California
Home is just another word for you
Well I never had a place
That I could call my very own
Thats all right my love
Cause youre my home
If I travel all my life
And I never get to stop and settle down
Long as I have you by my side
Theres a roof above
And good walls all around
Youre my castle youre my cabin
And my instant pleasure dome
I need you in my house
Cause youre my home
Youre my home
