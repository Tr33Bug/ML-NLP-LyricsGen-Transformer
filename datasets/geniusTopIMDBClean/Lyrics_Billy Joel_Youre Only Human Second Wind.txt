You’re Only Human (Second Wind) Lyrics
Ooh-ooh yeah ooh
You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood

(It's alright) It's alright, sometimes that's what it takes
(You're only human) You're allowed to make your share of mistakes (Only human ooh-ooh)

You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents
Than anything that you could ever learn at school
Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll get your second wind

Ooh-ooh yeah
It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again

(It's alright) It's alright though you feel your heart break
(You're only human) You're gonna have to deal with heartache
(You're only human)

Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone (Oh oh oh oh)
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own

Don't forget your second wind
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in

You've been keeping to yourself these days
'Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
'Til that old second wind comes along
You might also like(Only human ooh-ooh)
(Only human)

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself
(It's alright) It's alright, s-sometimes that's what it takes hahaha
We're only human, We're supposed to make mistakes (Only human ooh-ooh)
But I survived all those long lonely days (Oh oh oh oh)
When it seemed I did not have a friend
'Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could catch my breath and face the world again

Don’t forget your second wind
Sooner or later you’ll feel that momentum kick in
One more time
Don’t forget your second wind
Sooner or later you’ll feel that momentum kick in

Don’t forget your second wind (Only human ooh-ooh)
Don’t forget your second wind (only human)
Second wind
Don’t forget your second wind (Only human ooh ooh)
(Only human)1Embed
