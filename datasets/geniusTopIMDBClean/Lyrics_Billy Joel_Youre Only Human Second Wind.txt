Youre Only Human  Second Wind  Lyrics
Oohooh yeah ooh
Youre having a hard time and lately you dont feel so good
Youre getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
Its alright  Its alright sometimes thats what it takes
Youre only human  Youre allowed to make your share of mistakes  Only human oohooh 
You better believe there will be times in your life
When youll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me youll learn more from your accidents
Than anything that you could ever learn at school
Dont forget your second wind
Sooner or later youll get your second wind
Oohooh yeah
Its not always easy to be living in this world of pain
Youre gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
Its alright  Its alright though you feel your heart break
Youre only human  Youre gonna have to deal with heartache
Youre only human 
Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone  Oh oh oh oh 
Youre not the only one whos made mistakes
But theyre the only thing that you can truly call your own
Dont forget your second wind
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in
Youve been keeping to yourself these days
Cause youre thinking everythings gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
Til that old second wind comes along

 Only human oohooh 
Only human 
You probably dont want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldnt be telling you if I hadnt been there myself
Its alright  Its alright ssometimes thats what it takes hahaha
Were only human Were supposed to make mistakes  Only human oohooh 
But I survived all those long lonely days  Oh oh oh oh 
When it seemed I did not have a friend
Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could catch my breath and face the world again
Dont forget your second wind
Sooner or later youll feel that momentum kick in
One more time
Dont forget your second wind
Sooner or later youll feel that momentum kick in
Dont forget your second wind  Only human oohooh 
Dont forget your second wind  only human 
Second wind
Dont forget your second wind  Only human ooh ooh 
Only human
