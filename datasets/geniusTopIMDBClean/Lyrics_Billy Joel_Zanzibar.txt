Ali dances and the audience applauds
Though hes bathed in sweat he hasnt lost his style
Ali dont you go downtown
You gave away another round for free woah
Me Im just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile woah
Shes waiting out in Shantytown
Shes gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me
Ive got the old mans car
Ive got a jazz guitar
Ive got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight thats where Ill be
Ill be
Rose he knows hes such a credit to the game
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
Melodramas so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see woah
Me Im trying just to get to second base
And Id steal it if she only gave the sign woah
Shes gonna give the go ahead
The inning isnt over yet for me
For me
Ive got the old mans car
Ive got a jazz guitar
Ive got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight thats where Ill be Ill be


Tell the waitress Ill come back to Zanzibar
Ill be hiding in the darkness with my beer woah
Shes waiting out in Shantytown
Shes gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me
Ive got the old mans car
Ive got a jazz guitar
Ive got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight thats where Ill be Ill be
