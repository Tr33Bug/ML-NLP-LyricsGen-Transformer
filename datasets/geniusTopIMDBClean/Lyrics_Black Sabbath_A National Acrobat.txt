I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime
Ive lived a thousand times I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images the unborn child that never was conceived
When little worlds collide Im trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories are cast into the neverending well
The name that scorns the face the child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that belies the fate of those who never ran
You gotta believe yeah Im talking to you
Well I know its hard for you to know the reason why
And I know youll understand more when its time to die
Dont believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on
I want you to listen Im trying to get through
Love has given life to you and now its your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still I look but not to touch the seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls the secret stays unknown
Just remember love is life and hate is living death
Treat your life for what its worth and live for every breath
Looking back Ive lived and learned but now Im wondering
Here I wait and only guess what this next life will bring haha
