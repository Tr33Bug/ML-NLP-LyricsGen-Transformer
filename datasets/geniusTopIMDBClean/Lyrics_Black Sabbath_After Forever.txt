Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved
Or perhaps you think
That when you are dead
You just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
Or is he a part of you
Is Christ just a name
That you read in the book
When you were in school
When you think about death
Do you lose your breath
Or do you keep your cool
Would you like to see the Pope
On the end of a rope
Do you think hes a fool
Well I have seen the truth
Yes Ive seen the light
And Ive changed my ways
And Ill be prepared
When youre lonely and scared
At the end of our days
Could it be youre afraid
Of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above
They should realise before they criticise
That God is the only way to love
Is your mind so small
That you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well
Worship the sun


I think it was true it was people like you
That crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
Was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure
When your day is near
Say you dont believe
You had the chance
But you turned it down
Now you cant retrieve
Perhaps youll think before you say
God is dead and gone
Open your eyes just realise
That He is the one
The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you jeer at all you hear
Yes I think its too late
