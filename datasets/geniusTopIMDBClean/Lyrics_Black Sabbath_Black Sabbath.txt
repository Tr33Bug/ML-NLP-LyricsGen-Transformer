What is this that stands before me
Figure in black which points at me
Turn round quick and start to run
Find out Im the chosen one
Oh no
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satans sitting there hes smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no no please God help me
Is it the end my friend
Satans coming round the bend
People running cause theyre scared
The people better go and beware
No no please no
