I feel unhappy I feel so sad
Ive lost the best friend that I ever had
She was my woman I loved her so
But its too late now Ive let her go
Im going through changes
Im going through changes
We shared the years we shared each day
In love together we found the way
But soon the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded love went astray
Im going through changes
Im going through changes
It took so long to realise
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now all my days are filled with tears
Wish I could go back and change these years
Im going through changes
Im going through changes
