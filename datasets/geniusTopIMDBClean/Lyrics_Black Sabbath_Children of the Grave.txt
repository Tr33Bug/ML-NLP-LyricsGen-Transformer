Revolution in their minds
The children start to march
Against the world
In which they have to live
And all the hate thats in their hearts
Theyre tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
Theyll fight the world until theyve won
And love comes flowing through
Yeah
Children of tomorrow live
In the tears that fall today
Will the sunrise of tomorrow
Bring in peace in any way
Must the world live in the shadow
Of atomic fear
Can they win the fight for peace
Or will they disappear Yeah
So you children of the world
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the word today
Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave
Or you children of today
Are children of the grave yeah
Children of the grave
Children of the grave
Children of the grave
