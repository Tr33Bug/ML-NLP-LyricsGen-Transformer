In the misty morning on the edge of time
Weve lost the rising sun a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars we blind the sky
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
Wed glide above the ground before we learned to run run
Now it seems our world has come undone
Oh they say that its over
And it just had to be
Oh they say that its over
Were lost children of the sea
Oh woah
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door
Oh they say that its over yeah
And it just had to be
Yes they say that its over
Were lost children of the sea
Oh
In the misty morning on the edge of time
Weve lost the rising sun a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars we blind the sky


Oh they say that its over
And it just had to be
Oh they say that its over
Poor lost children of the sea
Yeah
Look out The sky is falling down
Look out The world is spinning round and round and round
Look out The sun is going black black
Look out Its never never never coming back look out
