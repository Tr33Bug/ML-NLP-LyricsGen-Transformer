Too much near the truth they say
Keep it till another day
Let them have their little game
Delusion helps to keep them sane
Let them have their little toys
Matchbox cars and mortgaged joys
Exciting in their plastic ways
Frozen food in a concrete maze
Youre gonna go insane
Im trying to save your brain
All right
I dont know whats happening
My heads all torn inside
People say Im heavy
They dont know what I hide
Take a life its going cheap
Kill someone no one will weep
Freedoms yours just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use
Youre gonna go insane
Im trying to save your brain
