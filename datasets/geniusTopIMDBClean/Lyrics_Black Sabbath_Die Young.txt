Ooh gather the wind though the wind wont help you fly at all
Your backs to the wall
Chain the sun and it tears away
To face you as you run you run you run
Behind the smile theres danger and a promise to be told
Youll never get old
Lifes fantasy to be locked away
And still to think youre free youre free were free
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes
Die young die young
Cant you see the writing in the air
Die young gonna die young
Someone stopped the fair
Gather the wind though the wind wont help you fly at all
Your backs to the wall
Then chain the sun and it tears away
And it tears away to face you as you run you run you run
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes
Die young young
Die young die young
Die young die young young
Die young die young die young die young die young
