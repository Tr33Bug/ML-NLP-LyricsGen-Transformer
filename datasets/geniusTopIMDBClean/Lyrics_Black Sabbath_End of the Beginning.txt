Is this the end of the beginning
Or the beginning of the end
Losing control or are you winning
Is your life real or just pretend
Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be recast
Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your lifes on overload
Delete or save
The units that make you an entity
Thats your identity
If you dont know which way to go
You might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to lose
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up resist and be the master of your fate
Dont look badly for today tomorrow is too late
You dont wanna be a robot ghost
Occupied inside the human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free
Alright okay alright
Til they set you free
Alright okay
Til they set you free
I dont wanna see you yeah
I dont wanna see you yeah
