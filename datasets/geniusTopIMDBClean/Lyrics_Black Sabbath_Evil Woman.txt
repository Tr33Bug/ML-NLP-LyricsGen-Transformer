I see the look of evil in your eyes
Youve been filling me all full of lies
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds
You will bear someone elses fertile seed
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Now I know just what youre looking for
You want me to claim this child you bore
Well you know that it was he not me
And you know the way its got to be
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Evil woman dont you play your games with
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Wickedness lies in your moistened lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Black cat sleeps on top of your stained bed
Dont you wish that you could see me dead
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
