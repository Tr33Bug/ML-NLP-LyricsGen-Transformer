Lost in the darkness I fade from the light
Faith of my father my brother my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead
Is God dead
Rivers of evil run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow they kill steal and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole
When will this nightmare be over
Tell me
When can I empty my head
Will someone tell me the answer
Is God really dead
Is God really dead
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timings right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light


I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I dont need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I dont believe that God is dead
God is dead
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead
God is dead God is dead
God is dead God is dead right
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down the rain turns red
I dont believe that God is dead
God is dead God is dead
God is dead God is dead
