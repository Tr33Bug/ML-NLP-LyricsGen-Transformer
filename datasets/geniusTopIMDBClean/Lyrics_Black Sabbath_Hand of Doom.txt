What you gonna do
Times caught up with you
Now you wait your turn
You know theres no return
Take your routine roles
You join the other fools
Turn to something new
Now its killing you
First it was the bomb
Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in
From life you escape
Realitys black drape
Colours in your mind
Satisfy your time
Oh you you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you dont know
Youre giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool now
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your bodys looking ill
To you its shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Dont stop to think now
Youre having a good time baby but that wont last
Your minds all full of things youre living too fast
Go out enjoy yourself dont bottle it in
You need someone to help you stick the needle in yeah
Now you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see
Lifes reality
Push the needle in
Face Deaths sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin


Head starts spinning round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Deaths hand starts to weave
Its too late to turn
You dont wanna learn
Price of life you cry
Now youre gonna die
