TranslationsPortugus
Sing me a song youre a singer
Do me a wrong youre a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give youre a taker
So its on and on and on
Its Heaven and Hell oh well yeah
The lover of lifes not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner youll know that youre dreaming
So its on and on and on
Oh its on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell I can tell
Fool fool
Ohoh oh
Oohooh ooh
Yeahyeah yeah
Well if it seems to be real its illusion
For every moment of truth theres confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer
But nobody bleeds for the dancer
And its on and on on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on
They say that lifes a carousel
Spinning fast you gotta ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
Its Heaven and Hell oh well
And theyll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
Its Heaven and Hell oh no
Fool fool
Youve got to bleed for the dancer
Fool fool
Look for the answer
Fool fool fool
