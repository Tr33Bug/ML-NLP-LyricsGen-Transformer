Hole in the Sky Lyrics
Attack!

I’m looking through a hole in the sky
I’m seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I’m getting closer to the end of the line
I’m living easy where the sun doesn’t shine

I’m living in a room without any view
I’m living free because the rent’s never due
The synonym of all the things that I’ve said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it, I’ll fly

I’ve seen the stars that disappear in the sun
But shooting’s easy if you’ve got the right gun
And even though I’m sitting waiting for Mars
I don’t believe there’s any future in cars

Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it, I’ll fly
Yeah!


I’ve watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I’ve seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
And now we’re living on the profits of crime
