Attack
Im looking through a hole in the sky
Im seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
Im getting closer to the end of the line
Im living easy where the sun doesnt shine
Im living in a room without any view
Im living free because the rents never due
The synonym of all the things that Ive said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it Ill fly
Ive seen the stars that disappear in the sun
But shootings easy if youve got the right gun
And even though Im sitting waiting for Mars
I dont believe theres any future in cars
Hole in the sky
Gateway to Heaven
Window in time
Through it Ill fly
Yeah
Ive watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
Ive seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
And now were living on the profits of crime
