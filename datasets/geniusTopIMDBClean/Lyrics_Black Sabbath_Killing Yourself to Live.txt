Well people look and people stare
Well I dont think that I even care
You work your life away and what do they give
Youre only killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live
Just take a look around you what do you see
Pain suffering and misery
Its not the way that the world was meant
Its a pity you dont understand
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live
Im telling you believe in me nobody else will tell you
Open your eyes and see the lies oh yeah
Smoke it get high 
You think that Im crazy and baby I know that its true
Before that you know it I think that youll go crazy too
I dont know if Im up or down
Whether black is white or blue is brown
The colors of my life are all different somehow
Little boy blues a big girl now
So you think its me whos strange
But youve never had to make the change
Never give your trust away
Youll end up paying till your dying day
