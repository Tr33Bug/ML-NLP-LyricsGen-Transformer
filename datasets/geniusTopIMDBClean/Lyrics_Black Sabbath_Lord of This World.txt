Youre searching for your mind dont know where to start
Cant find the key to fit the lock on your heart
You think you know but you are never quite sure
Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure yeah
Your world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love
You made me master of the world where you exist
The soul I took from you was not even missed yeah
Lord of this world
Evil possessor
Lord of this world
Hes your confessor now
You think youre innocent youve nothing to fear
You dont know me you say but isnt it clear
You turn to me in all your wordly greed and pride
But will you turn to me when its your turn to die Yeah
