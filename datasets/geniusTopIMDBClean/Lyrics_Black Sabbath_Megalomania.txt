I hide I hide I hide I hide I hide I hide I hide I hide 
I hide myself inside the shadows of shame
The silent symphonies were playing their game
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul
It started something that I could not control
Where can I run to now the joke is on me
No sympathizing God its insanity yeah
Why dont you just get out of my life yeah
Why dont you just get out of my life now
Why doesnt everybody leave me alone now
Why doesnt everybody leave me alone yeah
Obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed obsessed 
Obsessed with fantasy possessed with my schemes
I mixed reality with pseudoGod dreams
The ghost of violence was something Id seen
I sold my soul to be the human obscene
How could this poison be the dream of my soul
How did my fantasies take complete control yeah
Why dont you just get out of my life yeah
Why dont you just get out of my life now
Why doesnt everybody leave me alone now
Why doesnt everybody leave me alone yeah
Well I feel somethings taking me I dont know where
Its like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favourite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind
Feel it slipping away slipping in tomorrow
Gotta get to happiness want no more of sorrow


Realised when to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Now am I right if I fight
That I might just get away from you now
Sting me
Well I feel somethings giving me the chance to return
Its giving me the chance of saving my soul
Pictures of demigod are fading away
Im going backward but Im in control
Feel it slipping away slipping in tomorrow
Getting back to sanity providence of sorrow
Was it wise to disguise
How I tried to get away from you now
Is there a way that I can pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you now
How I lied went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right in my fight
That I might just get away from you now
Suck me
Im really digging schizophrenia the best of the earth
Ill chase my soul in the fires of hell
Peace of mind eluded me but now its all mine
I simply try but he wants me to fail
Feel it slipping away slipping in tomorrow
Now Ive found my happiness from the depths of sorrow
No more lies I got wise
I despise the way I worshiped you
Now Im free cant you see
That now instead I wont be led by you now
Free
No
Oh
Oh Oh
Oh
