People going nowhere taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason looking for a rhyme
Snow white parasite partners in crime
Dont they ever have to worry
Dont you ever wonder why
Its a part of me that tells you
Oh dont you ever dont ever say die
Never never never say die again
Sunday satisfaction madness on the rise
Truth is on the doorstep welcoming the lies
All dressed up in sorrow got no place to go
Hold tight do it right taking it slow
Dont they ever have to worry
Dont you ever wonder why
Its a part of me that tells you
Oh dont you ever dont ever say die
Never never never say die again
Dont you ever say die
Dont you ever say die
Never say die
Fading silver lining writing on the wall
Children get together you can save us all
Futures on the corner showing us our time
Slow down turn around everythings fine
Theres no need to have a reason
Theres no need to wonder why
Its a part of me that tells you
Oh dont you ever dont ever say die
Never never never say die again


Never say die
