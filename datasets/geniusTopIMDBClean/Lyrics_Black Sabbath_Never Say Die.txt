Never Say Die Lyrics
People going nowhere, taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow white parasite, partners in crime

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Sunday satisfaction, madness on the rise
Truth is on the doorstep, welcoming the lies
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold tight, do it right, taking it slow

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

Fading silver lining, writing on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, showing us our time
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
