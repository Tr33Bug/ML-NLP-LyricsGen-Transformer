TranslationsFranais
Finished with my woman
Cause she couldnt help me with my mind
People think Im insane
Because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think Ill lose my mind
If I dont find something to pacify
Can you help me
Occupy my brain
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I cant find
I cant see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but its too late
