Sabbath Bloody Sabbath Lyrics
You've seen right through distorted eyes, you know you had to learn
The execution of your mind, you really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read, the end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old, but you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
The people who have crippled you, you wanna see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you, and there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again the light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies, you bastards!


Where can you run to? What more can you do?
No more tomorrow, life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares, heaven turns to Hell
Burnt out confusion, nothing more to tell, yeah
Everything around you, what's it coming to?
God knows as your dog nose, bog, blast all of you
Sabbath bloody sabbath, nothing more to do
Living just for dying, dying just for you, yeahYou might also like9Embed
