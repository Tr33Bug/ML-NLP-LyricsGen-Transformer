What you get and what you see
Things that dont come easily
Feeling happy in my pain
Icicles within my brain  Cocaine 
Something blowing in my head
Winds of ice that soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy makes me cold
My eyes are blind but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the trees
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon Ill feel the chilling glow
Right
Dont you think I know what Im doing
Dont tell me that its doing me wrong
Youre the one thats really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Right
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come
