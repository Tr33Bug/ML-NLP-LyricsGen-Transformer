My name it means nothing my fortune is less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is far away clouds linger on
Everything I possessed now they are gone
They are gone they are gone
Oh where can I go to and what can I do
Nothing can please me only thoughts are of you
You just laughed when I begged you to stay
Ive not stopped crying since you went away
You went away you went away
The world is a lonely place youre on your own
Guess I will go home sit down and moan
Crying and thinking is all that I do
Memories I have remind me of you
Of you of you
