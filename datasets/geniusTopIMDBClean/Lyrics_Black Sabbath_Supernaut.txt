I wanna reach out and touch the sky
I wanna touch the sun but I dont need to fly
Im gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon
Ive crossed the oceans turned every bend
I found the plastic and the golden rainbows end
Ive been through magic and through lifes reality
Ive lived a thousand years it never bothered me
Got no religion dont need no friends
Got all I want and I dont need to pretend
Dont try to reach me cause Ill tear up your mind
Ive seen the future and Ive left it behind
