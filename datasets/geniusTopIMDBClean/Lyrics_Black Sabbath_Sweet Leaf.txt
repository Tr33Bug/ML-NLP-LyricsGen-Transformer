Alright now
Wont you listen
When I first met you didnt realize
I cant forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh yeah
I love you
Oh you know it
My life was empty forever on a down
Until you took me showed me around
My life is free now my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf
Though you cant hear
