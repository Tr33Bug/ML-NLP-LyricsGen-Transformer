TranslationsEspa√±olSweet Leaf Lyrics
*Coughing*

Alright now
Won't you listen?
When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh, yeah!
I love you
Oh, you know it
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you, sweet leaf
Though you can't hear
Oh, yeah!


Come on now
Try it out
Straight people don't know
What you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world
Will love you, sweet leaf
Oh, yeah, baby!

Come on now! Oh, yeah!
Try me out, baby! Alright!
Oh, yeah-ah
I want you part of this sweet leaf
Oh, yeah! Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, try me out
I love you, sweet leaf, ohYou might also like7Embed
