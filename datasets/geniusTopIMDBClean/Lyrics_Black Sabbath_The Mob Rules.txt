Close the city and tell the people that
Somethings coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Take a bite from the wall oh
Youve nothing to say
Theyre breaking away
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules
Kill the spirit and youll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire you burn your fingers and
Lose your hold of the flame oh
Its over its done
The end is begun
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
Youve nothing to say
Oh theyre breaking away
If you listen to fools
Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and
Take you right back around
Youre all fools
The mob rules
