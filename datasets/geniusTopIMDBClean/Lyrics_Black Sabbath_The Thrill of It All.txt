Yeah
See
Inclination of direction
Walk and turn and twist adrift
With the children of creation
Futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper
With a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers
That are surely doomed to die
Wont you help me Mister Jesus
Wont you tell me if you can
When you see this world we live in
Do you still believe in Man
If my songs become my freedom
And my freedom turns to gold
Then Ill ask the final question
If the answer could be sold
Well thats my story and Im sticking to it
Cause I got no reason to lie yeah
Forget your problems that dont even exist
And Ill show you a way to get high
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So come alive you know youre magic to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Dont you think I know my own mind
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Why cant you believe its right here to be seen
Do you always have to be told yeah
For you and your problem you can never give up
Long before the answer was sold
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
