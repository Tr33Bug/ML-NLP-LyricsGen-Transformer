The way I feel is the way I am
I wish Id walked before I started to run to you
Just to you
What kind of people do you think we are
Another joker whos a rock and roll star for you
Just for you
The faithful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah for you
The shock troopers laying down on the floor
I wish theyd fallen into my private war with you
Yeah with you
Are you metal are you man
Youve changed a lot since you began
Yeah began
Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now youre through
Yeah youre through
You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the dark that you never heard came through
Yeah came through
Your fallen phallic god dismembered and gone
A poisoned father with his poisonous son thats you
Yeah thats you
I beg you please dont let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you
All of the promises that never came true
Youre gonna get what is coming to you thats true
Ah thats true
Are you Satan are you man
Youve changed a lot since it began
It began
Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now youre through
Cats rats 
The search is on so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Rob the dead they dont feel a thing
Leave the living for another day
Rats rat 
You are a nonentity you have no destiny
You are a figment of a thing unknown
A mantle picture of a stolen soul
A fornication of your golden throne
A smiling face it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery yeah
My life it started some time ago
Where it will end I dont know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was smart
I feel my world being torn apart
But everything is gonna work out fine
If it dont I think Ill lose my mind yeah
I know I know
I know yeah yeah I know
Listen to me while I sing this song
You might just think the words are wrong
Too many people advising me
But they dont know what my eyes see
But everything is gonna work out fine yeah
If it dont I feel Ill blow my mind yeah
