Well Im leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes Im leaving the sorrow and heartaches
Before it takes me away from my mind
Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes I can fit in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when Im dead
When sadness fills my days
Its time to turn away
And let tomorrows dreams
Become reality to me
So realise Im much better without you
Youre not the one and only thing in my heart
Ill just go back to pretending Im living
So this time Im gonna have the star part
