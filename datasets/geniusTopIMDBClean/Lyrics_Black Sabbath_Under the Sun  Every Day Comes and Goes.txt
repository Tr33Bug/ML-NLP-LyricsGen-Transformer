Well I dont want no Jesus freak to tell me what its all about
No black magician telling me to cast my soul out
Dont believe in violence I dont even believe in peace
Ive opened the door now my mind has been released
Well I dont want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I dont want no one to tell me where Im gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life I dont want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself cause no one else is true
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustration
People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower there grows a weed
In their world of makebelieve
So believe what I tell you its the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself you know you really shouldnt have to pretend
Dont let those empty people try to interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind
