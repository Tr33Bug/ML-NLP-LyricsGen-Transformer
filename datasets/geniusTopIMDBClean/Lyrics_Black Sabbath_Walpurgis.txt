Witches gather at black masses
Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill the church in ruins
Is the scene of evil doings
Its the place for all black sinners
Watch them eating dead rats innards
I guess its the same
Wherever you may go
Oh Lord yeah
Carry banners which denounce the lord
See me rocking in my grave
See them anoint my head with dead rats blood
See them stick this stake through me
Lord hold me back I just gotta go
They got a hold of my soul now
Lord can my brain escape what blood Im seeing
Look in my eyes and bear it all yeah
On the scene a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan sends out funeral pyre
Casts the priest into the fire
Its the place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats innards
I guess its the same
Wherever you may go
Oh Lord yeah
