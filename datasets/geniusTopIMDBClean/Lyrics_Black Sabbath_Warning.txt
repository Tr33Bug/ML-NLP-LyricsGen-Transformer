Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It mustve been a sign for me
To leave you well alone
I was born without you baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
You never said you love me
And I dont believe you can
Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now Ive got to love ya
Tell me who have I to blame
I was born without you baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Now the whole wide world is movin
Cause theres iron in my heart
I just cant keep from cryin
Cause you say weve got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love Ive never known


I was born without you baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong
Now the whole wide world is movin
Cause theres iron in my heart
I just cant keep from cryin
Cause you say weve got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love Ive never known
I was born without you baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong
