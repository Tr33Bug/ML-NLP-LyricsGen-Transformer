Long ago I wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion
Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didnt come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusion
Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears
So I found that life is just a game
But you know theres never been a winner
Try your hardest youll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when youre gone
Yeah when youre gone
