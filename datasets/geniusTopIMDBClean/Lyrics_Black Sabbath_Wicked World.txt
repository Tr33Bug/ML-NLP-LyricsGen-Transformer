The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People go to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead
A politicians job they say is very high
For he has to choose whos gotta go and die
They can put a man on the Moon quite easy
While people here on Earth are dying of old diseases
A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life thats harder
He doesnt even know who is his father
