Wicked World Lyrics
The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People go to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead

A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's gotta go and die
They can put a man on the Moon quite easy
While people here on Earth are dying of old diseases

A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his fatherYou might also like7Embed
