Leaning in your corner like a candidate for wax
Sidewalk social scientist dont get no satisfaction from your cigarette
Its ten to ten and time is running out
Lock up all your memories get out of here you know that we can run
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
Its 1159 and I want to stay alive
Pumping like a fugitive in cover from the night
Take it down the freeway like a bullet to the ocean
Wait until the morning take tomorrow by the hand
Take it down the highway like a rocket to the ocean we can run
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
Its 1159 and I want to stay alive
Hanging on a frequency and burning like a fire
Boy youve got the motion down its getting late Im tired and Ive lost control
Dont leave me here time is running out
Take me down the highway like a rocket to the ocean we can run
Today can last another million years
Today could be the end of me
Its 1159 and I want to stay alive
