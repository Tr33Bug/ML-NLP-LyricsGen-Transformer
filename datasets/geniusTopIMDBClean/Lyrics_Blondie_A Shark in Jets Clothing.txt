I always had my eyes on you but you came from across the line
I had to make good time to see you but you had to pay the fine
All the boys on my side knew that you were the shark
If you were found on the borderline youd be shot in the dark
Dont wear those clothes again they dont make it in this crowd
Dont go out DTK youll wear your best suit in the ground
Were meeting in a neutral zone the last car on the train
The love you brought shaking up my bones and crawling through our veins
We always met at the edge of a blade and we left at the end of the fight
Of all the girls youve played and you laid why did this one have to be white
Theyre going to get you at twelve oclock high got their sights set low on you
You better believe me I wouldnt lie we better quit before youre through
Theyre going to get you at twelve oclock high got their sights set low on you
You better believe me I wouldnt lie we better quit before youre through
