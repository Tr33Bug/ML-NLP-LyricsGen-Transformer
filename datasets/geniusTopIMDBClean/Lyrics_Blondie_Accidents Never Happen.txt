No I dont believe in luck
No I dont believe in circumstance no more
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
So I wont believe in luck
I saw you walking in the dark
So I slipped behind your footsteps for a while
Caught you turning round the block
Fancy meeting in a smaller world after all
Accidents never happen could have planned it all
Precognition in my ears
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Complications disappear
Now you love me
I yeah I can tell
I never lied I never cried
And you you knew so well
Like the Magi on the hill
I can divinate your presence from afar
And Ill follow you until
I can bring you to a perfect world
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Accidents never happen
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Accidents never happen
