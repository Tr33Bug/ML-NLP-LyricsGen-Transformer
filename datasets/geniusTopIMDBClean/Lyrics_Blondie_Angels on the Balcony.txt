Afterglow in a distant row
The door is open and the lights are cold
The children come in here and they dare the ghost
Like a fire burning in a stone
Ah
Silent light in the theatres sky
Phantom cigarette and a silent cry
The door swings open and its cold outside
Run and hide run and hide
Ah ah
They can still see him singing on the corner singing songs
That never fade away fade into the kids that come along
Memory in a silent seat
Melody on a long retreat
Like an angel on a balcony
Like an angel on a balcony
Ah ah ah ah
