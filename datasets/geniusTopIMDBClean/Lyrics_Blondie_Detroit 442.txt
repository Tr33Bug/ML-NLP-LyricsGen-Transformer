You know he cant be tested he cant be read or found
Urban grey takes breath away he wants to push his pedal to the ground
And the nights whats right puts him at the wheel
Well I eat danger any stranger is all right
Feel hot to go like Jimmy O dodging flying objects at the show
And the lights make me fight
In Detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you
This towns a concrete factory and Dad and Mum look just like me
Im on the plant assembly line Too late now Too far behind
You said you want to hang around noone really cares where you go
Take your time Things never change
In Detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you
In Detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you
In Detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you
In Detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you
One more to market one more piggie and they all they all look just like me yeah
