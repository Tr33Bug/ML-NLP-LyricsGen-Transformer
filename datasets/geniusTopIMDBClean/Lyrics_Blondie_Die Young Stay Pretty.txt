Die young stay pretty
Die young stay pretty
Deteriorate in your own time
Deteriorate in your own time 
Tell them youre dead and wither away
Are you living alone or with your family
A driedup twig on your family tree
Are you waiting for the reaper to arrive
Or just to die by the hand of love
Love for youth love for youth
So die young and stay pretty
Leave only the best behind
Slipping sensibilities
Tragedy in your own dream oh
Ah you sit all alone in your rocking chair
Transistor pressed against an ear
Were you waiting at the bus stop all your life
Or just to die by the hand of love
Love for youth love for youth
So live fast cause it wont last
Dearly near senility
Dearly near senility 
Was it good or maybe you wont tell


Die young and stay pretty
You got to live fast cause it wont last nono no
Die young and stay pretty ohho ho
Live fast cause it wont last nono
Die young stay pretty
You got to live fast cause it wont last nono no
Die young die young stay pretty aha haha
Live fast cause it wont last nono no
Die young and stay pretty ohho ho
