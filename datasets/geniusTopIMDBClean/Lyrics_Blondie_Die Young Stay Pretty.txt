Die Young Stay Pretty Lyrics
Die young, stay pretty
Die young, stay pretty

Deteriorate in your own time
(Deteriorate in your own time)
Tell them you're dead and wither away

Are you living alone, or with your family?
A dried-up twig on your family tree?
Are you waiting for the reaper to arrive?
Or, just to die by the hand of love?
Love for youth, love for youth
So, die young and stay pretty

Leave only the best behind
Slipping sensibilities
Tragedy in your own dream, oh


Ah, you sit all alone in your rocking chair
Transistor pressed against an ear
Were you waiting at the bus stop all your life?
Or, just to die by the hand of love?

Love for youth, love for youth
So, live fast 'cause it won't last

Dearly near senility
(Dearly near senility)
Was it good, or maybe, you won't tell?
You might also like
Die young and stay pretty
You got to live fast 'cause it won't last, no-no, no
Die young and stay pretty, oh-ho, ho
Live fast 'cause it won't last, no-no
Die young, stay pretty
You got to live fast 'cause it won't last, no-no, no
Die young, die young, stay pretty, a-ha, haha
Live fast 'cause it won't last, no-no, no
Die young and stay pretty, oh-ho, ho1Embed
