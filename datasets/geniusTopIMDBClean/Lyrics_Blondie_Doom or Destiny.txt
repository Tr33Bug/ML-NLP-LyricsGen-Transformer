Clear as a bell and an echoing shell
Clear as a pane of glass
I realize I cant revise
As clear as a big blue sky
Through and through it all
Youre trying to stall
Its clear as a crystal ball
As the facets are bold in platinum and gold
Clear as a flawless diamond
Im hitting the wall
I know Im gonna fall for you
Is it my fate or fatal attraction
Could it be a fait accompli
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Dark as a winters moonless night
Dark as a velvet cape
I realize I cant revise
Its dark as the other side
I can recommend but I cant defend
Its dark as a deep sea trench
I was stuck in a target having a shit fit
Dark as an angry inch
Oh I cant wait
Youre an outofstate plate oh
Its creepy fate or fatal attraction
Could it be a fait accompli


Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh is it doom or destiny
Oh
