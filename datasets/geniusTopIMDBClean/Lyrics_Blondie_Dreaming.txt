When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me whats my pleasure
A movie or a measure
Ill have a cup of tea and tell you of my
Dreaming dreaming is free
Dreaming dreaming is free
I dont want to live on charity
Pleasures real or is it fantasy
Reel to reel is living rarity
People stop and stare at me
We just walk on by  we just keep on dreaming
Feet feet walking a two mile
Meet meet meet me at the turnstile
I never met him Ill never forget him
Dream dream even for a little while
Dream dream filling up an idle hour
Fade away radiate
I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
Id build a road in gold just to have some
Dreaming dreaming is free
Dreaming dreaming is free
Dreaming dreaming is free
Dreaming dreaming is free
