Eat to the Beat Lyrics
You got to jump up, a-to the beat
Stand up, wo-on your feet
Toes are tippi tippi tippi tapping
And you do it even when you're yapping
Hey, you got a sweet tooth and I remember
Stand up on your feet
Toes are tippi tippi tippi tapping
Hey, you got a sweet tooth and I remember
Sitting in the kitchen eating peanut butter
Eat To The Beat
Yeah, you got to, got you got the beat
Ah, sweeter sweeter you beat your meat
I know you do it. I know you do it
I seen you, seen you, seen you, seen you chewing
Hey, you got a sweet tooth and I remember
A sweeter treat, uh, you beat your meat
I know you do it, I know you do it
Oh, you got a sweet tooth and I remember
Standing on the corner with a piece of pizza
Eat To The Beat

Condition red!

You got to jump up, a-to the beat
Stand up, wo-on your feet
Toes are tippi tippi tippi tapping
And you do it even when you're yapping
Oh you got a sweet tooth and I remember
I seen you, seen you, you beat your meat
I know you do it, I know you do it
Hey, you got a tummy ache and I remember
Sitting in the bathroom drinking Alka Seltzer
Eat To The Beat
