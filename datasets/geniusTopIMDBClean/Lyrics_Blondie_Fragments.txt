You cant create more time you just make it
If you want a new life just take it
And if you wanna change the world then speak real clear
And make sure someones listening listening
And if you wanna break my heart then stay right here
Yeah dont go anywhere
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Everything comes in pieces
Do you love me yet Fucking prove it
Try to ask yourself are you really different
Know that your life is more frightening than writing a song
Its an action of fractions youre passing along
And these oceans of emotion will crash once they hit the shore I promise you
And its the closest I will get to sincerity
The praise I make just looks so fake and cruel to me
And its the closest I will come to purity
Simulations never follow me
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
My heart is made up of pieces


Do you get it yet Can you see through this
You know all too well you cannot make things perfect
No Ill be shifting through lists of these possible loves
With this pain in my brain it feels scattered like doves
Through this sky where my eyes have been drifting towards recently
And its the closest I can be to egocentricity
This overwhelming sense of rejection will sneak up behind and tear at me
And itll slam me to the ground into reality
And Ill deal with my disparity
Oh do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Why dont you love me now
Why dont you love me now
This is where I fall down shattered on the floor
As Im swept along with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget
The truth the truth oh the truth the truth
This is where I fall down shattered on the floor
As Im swept along with a million pieces more
Of myself I once learned to lose
Though it never helped me forget
The truth the truth oh the truth the truth
