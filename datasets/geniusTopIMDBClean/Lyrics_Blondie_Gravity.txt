Im just sitting here in my treetop
Im just swing swing swinging away
Feel so magical feel so loved
Will you catch me on my way down
I drank your cherry cola
I let you win me over
Youre nicer when youre sober
Please just tell me
What makes the world go round
What makes the world go round
What makes the world go round
Is it love oh
Is it love ohoh
Is it love oh
Or is it gravity
Is it love oh
Is it love ohoh
Is it love oh
Or is it gravity
You chewed my heart and spat it out
Now youre run run running away
You didnt pick me off the floor
Will you catch me on my way down
My pretty mouth is open
My words they keep on flowing
Im nicer when Im sober
Im so sorry
What makes the world go round
What makes the world go round
What makes the world go round
Is it love oh
Is it love ohoh
Is it love oh
Or is it gravity
Is it love oh
Is it love ohoh
Is it love oh
Or is it gravity


Is it gravity
Or is it L O V E
This is gravity
Not L O V E

You see Ive been sitting here in my treetop
For a long time now Im not coming down
You see Ive been sitting here Ive been sitting here Ive been sitting here
Is it love oh

Or is it gravity
Is it love oh
Is it love ohoh
Is it love oh
Or is it gravity
