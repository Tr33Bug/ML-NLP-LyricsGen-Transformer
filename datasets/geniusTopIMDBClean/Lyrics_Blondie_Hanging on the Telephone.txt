Im in the phone booth its the one across the hall
If you dont answer Ill just ring it off the wall
I know hes there but I just had to call
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone
I heard your mother now shes going out the door
Did she go to work or just go to the store
All those things she said I told you to ignore
Oh why cant we talk again
Oh why cant we talk again
Oh why cant we talk again
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone
Its good to hear your voice you know its been so long
If I dont get your calls then everything goes wrong
I want to tell you something youve known all along
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation
Id like to talk when I can show you my affection
Oh I cant control myself
Oh I cant control myself
Oh I cant control myself
Dont leave me hanging on the telephone
Hang up and run to me  oh 
Hang up and run to me  oh 
Hang up and run to me  oh 
Hang up and run to me
Oh woah woah woah
Run to me yeah
