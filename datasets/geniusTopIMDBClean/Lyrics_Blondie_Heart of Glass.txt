Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
In between what I find is pleasing and Im feeling fine
Love is so confusing theres no peace of mind
If I fear Im losing you its just no good
You teasing like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
Lost inside adorable illusion and I cannot hide
Im the one youre using please dont push me aside
We couldve made it cruising yeah
Dadada dadumdadumda dadumdadada
Dadumdadumda dadumdadada dadumdadumda 
Yeah riding high on loves true bluish light
Ooohahah ooohahah ooohahah ooohahah
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out it was a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
Ooohahah ooohahah ooohahah ooohahah
