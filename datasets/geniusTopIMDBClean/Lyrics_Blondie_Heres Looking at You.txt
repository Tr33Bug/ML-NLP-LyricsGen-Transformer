As I sit staring into this liquid amber ripples move out to the edge of the glass
Is that really your reflection in there
I just want to jump into the warm depths and be there with you one more time
Oh alright
Hit it boys
My initials sprayed across a pavement
Cut into your private interview
Talk to me now step into my room
Well have a word or two
If I ever had a million dollars
And if I didnt give it all to you
Would you lose interest show me indifference
Foot in another shoe
Not very high heels
Not wearing sneakers too
A magazine ad a printed canvas
A basic new shade blue suede shoe
Thought Id like to have a little party
Thought Id like to have a little do
Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment
Honey heres looking at you
Ill stop my drinking give you my promise true
Clean out the closet be existential
And cast a vote for the president too
But for the action of the moment
Nothing does what it ought to do
Instant depression I learned my lesson
Nothing that Id rather do
Come on over my place cant see him sideways
Honey heres looking at you
