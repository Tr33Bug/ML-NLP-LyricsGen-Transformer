Hey you know
Oh I dont know
I know but I dont know
I know but I dont know
I know but I dont know
I know but I dont know
I give but I dont get
I will but I wont yet
I lose but I dont bet
Im your dog but not your pet
I know but I dont care
Then I know but I dont see
Now I see but I dont know
I care but I dont care
I could but I wont be
You can but not with me
Its all a mystery
Locked out without a key
Now I care but I dont care
And I know but I dont see
Now I see but I dont know
I know but I dont know
Now I know that you dont know
And I see that you dont see
I care but I dont care
I dont care that you dont know
