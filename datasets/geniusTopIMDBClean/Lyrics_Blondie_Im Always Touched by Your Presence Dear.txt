Im Always Touched by Your  Presence Dear Lyrics
Was it destiny
I dont know yet
Was it just by chance Could this be Kismet
Something in my consciousness told me youd appear
Now Im always touched by your presence dear
When we play at cards you use an extra sense  its really not cheating 
You can read my hand Ive got no defense
When you sent your messages whispered loud and clear
I am always touched by your presence dear
Floating past the evidence of possibilities
We could navigate together psychic frequencies
Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophies
Stay awake at night and count your REMs when youre talking with your super friends
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere
I am still in touch with your presence dear
I am still in touch with your presence dear
I am still in touch with your presence dear dear dear dear dear
