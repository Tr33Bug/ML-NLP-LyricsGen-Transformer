Youre going to say you miss me
Youre going to say youll kiss me
Youre going to say you love me
Cause Im going to love you too
I dont care what you told me
Youre going to say youll hold me
Youre going to say you love me
Cause Im going to love you too
After all another fella took you
But I still cant overlook you
Im going to do my best to hook you
After all is said and done
I dont care what you told me
Youre gonna say youll hold me
And youre gonna say you love me
Cause Im gonna love you too
Youre gonna tell me sweet things
Youre gonna make my heart sing
And Im gonna hear bells ring
Cause Im gonna love you too
After all another fella took you
But I still cant overlook you
Im going to do my best to hook you
After all is said and done
Youre going to say you kiss me
Youre going to say youll miss me
Youre going to say you love me
Cause Im going to love you too
Im going to love you too
Im going to love you too
Im going to love you too
