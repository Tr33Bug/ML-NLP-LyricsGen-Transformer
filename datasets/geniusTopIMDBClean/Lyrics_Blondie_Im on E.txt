Im on E
Im on E
Im on E
Got nothing to say
I used to have a car of my own
Im on E
Im on E
Im on E for England
Laid out for maybe a week
Ive walked my feet to the bone
Id give my life for a car of my own
Im on E
Im on E
Two weeks ago Saturday I was on TV
Id like a show of my own
But you see Im still on E
Even though everything is happening to me
So when youre driving on home
Dont regret your loan
Im on E
Im on E
I gave my car to a guy named Vinnie
I feel like gassing my feet
Theyve totaled me and skipped a beat
I used to have a car of my own
28 or 58
Walking to refrigerator
To the pump do the bump
Still on E Ill think of something
Im on E and Im on E
Ill never have to stop my feet
28 or 58
Walking to refrigerator
To the pump do the bump
Still on E Ill think of something
Im on E and Im on E
Ill never have to fill my feet up
