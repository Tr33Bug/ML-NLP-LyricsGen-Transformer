Iâ€™m on E LyricsI'm on E
I'm on E
I'm on E
Got nothing to say
I used to have a car of my own
I'm on E
I'm on E
I'm on E for England
Laid out for maybe a week
I've walked my feet to the bone
I'd give my life for a car of my own
I'm on E
I'm on E
Two weeks ago Saturday I was on TV
I'd like a show of my own
But you see I'm still on E
Even though everything is happening to me
So when you're driving on home
Don't regret your loan
I'm on E
I'm on E
I gave my car to a guy named Vinnie
I feel like gassing my feet
They've totaled me and skipped a beat
I used to have a car of my own
28 or 58
Walking to refrigerator
To the pump, do the bump
Still on E, I'll think of something
I'm on E and I'm on E
I'll never have to stop my feet
28 or 58
Walking to refrigerator
To the pump, do the bump
Still on E, I'll think of something
I'm on E and I'm on E
I'll never have to fill my feet up
