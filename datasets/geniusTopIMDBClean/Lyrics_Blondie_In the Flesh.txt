Darling darling darling
I cant wait to see you
Your picture aint enough
I cant wait to touch you in the flesh  Ooh 
Darling darling darling  Darling 
I cant wait to hear you
Remembering your love  Ooh 
Is nothing without you in the flesh
Went walking one day on the lower East side
Met you with a girlfriend you were so divine
She said Hands off this one sweetie this boy is mine
I couldnt resist you Im not deaf dumb and blind
Darling darling darling  Darling 
Now youre out of town
Those girls that you run with  Ooh 
They bring my head down
Ooh darling  Darling  darling  Darling 
Watch out if I see you
Cause if you say Hello
Itll mean you want to see me in the flesh
Ooh warm and soft in the flesh
Ooh close and hot in the flesh
Ooh
