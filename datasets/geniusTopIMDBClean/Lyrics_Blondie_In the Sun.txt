In the Sun Lyrics
Hm
Surf's up

In the sun, I'm waiting for the day
Having fun, and you're far away
Moonlight nights, water seems so clear
Ooh, city lights while I'm still waiting here

In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love
New York isle is covered by gray
Concrete piles, blues play my way
Tropic haze, pineapple sky
Perfect wave, hurricane eye

In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love

In the sun, it's for everyone
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love

Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?
Where is my wave?You might also likeEmbed
