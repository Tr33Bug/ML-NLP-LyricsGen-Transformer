Hm
Surfs up
In the sun Im waiting for the day
Having fun and youre far away
Moonlight nights water seems so clear
Ooh city lights while Im still waiting here
In the sun its for everyone
In the sun were gonna have some fun
In the sun were gonna shoot the tube
Ill do it for you my paka lola luau love
New York isle is covered by gray
Concrete piles blues play my way
Tropic haze pineapple sky
Perfect wave hurricane eye
In the sun its for everyone
In the sun were gonna have some fun
In the sun were gonna shoot the tube
Ill do it for you my paka lola luau love
In the sun its for everyone
In the sun were gonna have some fun
In the sun were gonna shoot the tube
Ill do it for you my paka lola luau love
Where is my wave
Where is my wave
Where is my wave
Where is my wave
