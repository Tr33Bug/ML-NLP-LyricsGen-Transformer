Oh dont ya know
Dont wanna see you any more
Put up or shut up
You spell you read
DOOR
You got a big mouth and Im happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be
If you talk much louder you could get an award
From the federal communications board
Dont be cruel
Be a thingsweet thing as a rule
Dont be sad
I left you in the street youre prefab
I had to get away
Dont go away sad
Dont go prefab
Dont go be bad
Dont go away mad
Just go away  Go away 
Oh dont ya know
Dont wanna see you here no more
Pack it and move it
You spell you read OUT out
Dont be bad
A mad hatters beret
Sometimes you look like you just mad an escape
Dont be mad
Or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool
Dont go away sad
Dont go prefab
Dont go be bad
Dont go away mad
Just go away  Go away 


Oh dont ya know
Dont wanna see ya curse and pout
Pack it and move it
Ya spell ya read OUT out
You got a big mouth and Im happy to see
Your foot is firmly entrenched where a molar should be
Dont be mad or lose your medicaid cool
Of course cool rhymes with fool
Dont go prefab
Cause you been had
Dont go be sad
Dont go away mad
Just go away  Go away 
Dont go prefab
Cause you been had
Dont go be sad
Dont go away mad
Just go away  Go away 
Go away and stay away
