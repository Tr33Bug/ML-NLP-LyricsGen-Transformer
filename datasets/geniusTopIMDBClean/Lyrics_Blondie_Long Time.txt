Ive been running circles round a night that never ends
Ive been chasing heartache in a city and a friend
Ive been with you so long even seen you lose it but who cares
Racing down the bowery on a crowded afternoon
Dripping from the downpour of your insecure typhoon
Can you even want me or this is just a way to keep you safe
Take me then lose me then tell them Im yours
Are you happy
Does it take you a long time
Does it make you upset
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend
I can give you a heartbeat I can give you a friend
I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend
Drinking with your cell phone with a smile on your face
Happy in success but still a thousand miles away
Is this what you wanted is this everything you had in store
Take me then lose me then tell them Im yours
Are you happy
Does it take you a long time
Does it make you upset
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend
I can give you a heartbeat i can give you a friend
I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend
Take me then lose me then tell them Im yours
Are you happy
Ive been running circles round a night that never ends
Ive been chasing heartache in a city and a friend
Ive been with you so long even seen you lose it but who cares
Does it take you a long time
Does it make you upset
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend
I can give you a heartbeat I can give you a friend
I can make you think everybody wants to be your friend
Take me then lose me then tell them Im yours
Take me then lose me then tell them Im yours
Take me then lose me then tell them Im yours
Take me then lose me then tell them Im yours
