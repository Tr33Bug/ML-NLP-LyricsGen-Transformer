Look Good in Blue LyricsYou look good in blue
It matches your skin, your eyes dripping with pain
Someone like you
Getting off on the lies 'cause it dulls your surprise again
If it's alright with you
I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on
You look good in blue
I know what you mean when you say you've seen the end
Someone like you
Been at it again, you knew what was up in the end
If it's alright with you
I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on
Throw your weight on me baby
Don't complain on me baby
Escape in me, next to me
I'm tired, always tired and I got not place to sleep (Got no place to sleep)
Don't mind dividing down the line (Down the line)
Can't say that I'm complaining 'cause I got no place to play, yeah (No place to play)
Don't mind dividing down the line
You look good in blue
It matches your skin, your eyes dripping with pain
If it's alright with you
I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on
Yes, I could give you some head and shoulders to lie onYou might also likeEmbed
