You look good in blue
It matches your skin your eyes dripping with pain
Someone like you
Getting off on the lies cause it dulls your surprise again
If its alright with you
I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on
You look good in blue
I know what you mean when you say youve seen the end
Someone like you
Been at it again you knew what was up in the end
If its alright with you
I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on
Throw your weight on me baby
Dont complain on me baby
Escape in me next to me
Im tired always tired and I got not place to sleep  Got no place to sleep 
Dont mind dividing down the line  Down the line 
Cant say that Im complaining cause I got no place to play yeah  No place to play 
Dont mind dividing down the line
You look good in blue
It matches your skin your eyes dripping with pain
If its alright with you
I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on
Yes I could give you some head and shoulders to lie on
