Elevators on the rise
Ridin me up into the sky
Liftin to you sudden  
Numbers up above the door
Countin down but going up
Climbing floor to floor
I wear my highest heels
I want to feel proximity
When youre with me
All all I wanna do
Is level off level it off with you
Everyone can see
That you got inches on me
But when were lying down
The difference diminishes
What goes up must go down
Lookin up at the love we found
Gotta get to you somehow
I can barely reach you now
Im on my tippytoes
Cause eyetoeye is challenging
Ooh Im balancing 
I put my lips where they belong
A kissing marathon
Lets meet up there next time
And level out when we arrive
The size will equalise us
All all I wanna do
Is level off level it off with you
And my condition is clear
The height of an absurdity
But when were lying down
The difference is minimal
What goes up must go down
Lookin up at the love we found
Gotta get to you somehow
I can barely reach you now
Opposites attract you know
No rules no right or wrong
Cause when the love is strong
Everybody fucks Tall John
Learn you never learn
You never leave me in the park
Dinner after dark
Learn you never learn
You never ridin to the floor
Coming back for more
