She moves like she dont care
Smooth as silk cool as air
Ooh it makes you wanna cry
She doesnt know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh it makes you wanna die
Ooh dont you wanna take her
You wanna make her all your own
Maria
Youve gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Ive seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and fool on fire
Wont come in from the rain
Shes oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire
Dont you wanna make her
Ooh dont you wanna take her home
Maria
Youve gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights


Ooh dont you wanna break her
Ooh dont you wanna take her home
She walks like she dont care
You want to take her everywhere
Ooh it makes you wanna cry
Shes like a millionaire
Walking on imported air
Ooh it makes you wanna die
Maria
Youve gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Maria
Youve gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Maria
Youve gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Maria
Youve gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one
