My Monster Lyrics
Human beings are stupid things, when we're young
Scared stiff straight, all wooze and shakes on us
You just wait, yeah you just wait
And suddenly we go to muted imagination

Run, it's come, gone, it got to ya
In your heart, I've done this
Don't jump, get lost, in your hollow darkness
Your ghost, my god, there goes my monster
Ghouls and saints and phantoms and what are we afraid of
New fixates on human beings take off
Looking straight, yeah you should wait
So why you wanna go to insane imagination?

Run, it's come, gone, it got to ya
In your heart, I've done this
Don't jump, get lost, in your hollow darkness
Your ghost, my god, there goes my monster


Left to stray, yeah you should wait, take off
Foolish games and fire thrills, why you love to

Run, it's come, and go on, you've got to
Calm down, it comes to fascinate
Don't jump, get lost, in your hollow darkness
Your ghost, my god, there goes my monsterYou might also likeEmbed
