Human beings are stupid things when were young
Scared stiff straight all wooze and shakes on us
You just wait yeah you just wait
And suddenly we go to muted imagination
Run its come gone it got to ya
In your heart Ive done this
Dont jump get lost in your hollow darkness
Your ghost my god there goes my monster
Ghouls and saints and phantoms and what are we afraid of
New fixates on human beings take off
Looking straight yeah you should wait
So why you wanna go to insane imagination
Run its come gone it got to ya
In your heart Ive done this
Dont jump get lost in your hollow darkness
Your ghost my god there goes my monster
Left to stray yeah you should wait take off
Foolish games and fire thrills why you love to
Run its come and go on youve got to
Calm down it comes to fascinate
Dont jump get lost in your hollow darkness
Your ghost my god there goes my monster
