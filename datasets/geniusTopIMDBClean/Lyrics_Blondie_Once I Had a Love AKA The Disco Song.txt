Once I Had a Love  AKA The Disco Song  LyricsOnce I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin my mind
Seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
In between
What I find is pleasin and Im feelin fine
Love is so confusing theres no peace of mind
If I fear Im losin you its just no good
You teasin like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
Im the one youre usin please dont push me aside
We couldve made it cruisin yeah
Ridin high
On loves true bluish lie
Ooh oh
Ooh ah
Once I had a love I thought was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust loves gone behind
