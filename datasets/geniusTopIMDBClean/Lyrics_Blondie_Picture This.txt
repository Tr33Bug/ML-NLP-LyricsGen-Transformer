All I want is a room with a view
A sight worth seeing a vision of you
All I want is a room with view ohoh
I will give you my finest hour
The one I spent watching you shower
I will give you my finest hour oh yeah
All I want is a photo in my wallet
A small remembrance of something more solid
All I want is a picture of you
Picture this  a day in December
Picture this  freezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and youd be on the skids
If it werent for your job at the garage
If you could only ohoh
Picture this  a sky full of thunder
Picture this  my telephone number
One and one is what Im telling you oh yeah
All I want is 2020 vision
A total portrait with no omissions
All I want is a vision of you ohoh
If you can picture this  a day in December
Picture this  freezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and youd be on the skids
If it werent for your job at the garage
If you could only ohoh
Picture this  a sky full of thunder
Picture this  my telephone number
One and one is what Im telling you
Get a pocket computer
Try to do what you used to do yeah
