Stars live in the evening
But the very young need the sun uhhuh
Pretty baby you look so heavenly
A neonebular from under the sun
I was forming some say I had my chance
The boys were falling like an avalanche
Ya ya baby
La Dolce Vita is a magic dance
Noone was listening
Pretty baby un petite ingenue
A teenage starlet I fell in love with you
You you with the comb
You look OK in every way every way
Ah I should have known
Youd look at me and look away and look away  oh
Pretty baby you look so heavenly
A neonebular from under the sun
Eyes that tell me incense and peppermints
Your looks are larger than life long live innocence
Petite ingenue I fell in love with you
Pretty baby I fell in love with you whoah oh
Pretty baby oh oh
Pretty baby whoah oh I fell in love with you
