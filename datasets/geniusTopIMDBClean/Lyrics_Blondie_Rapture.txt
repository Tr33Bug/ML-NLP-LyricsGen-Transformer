Toe to toe dancing very close
Barely breathing almost comatose
Wall to wall people hypnotized
And theyre stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
Back to back sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face sightless solitude
And its finger popping
24hour shopping in rapture
Fab Five Freddy told me everybodys fly
DJ spinnin I said My My
Flash is fast Flash is cool
France Soir cest pas Flash et Nous Deux
Franois cest pas Flash aint no dude
And you dont stop sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but hes got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then youre in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin cars
You eat Cadillacs Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you dont stop you keep on eatin cars
Then when theres no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face dance cheek to cheek
One to one man to man
Dance toe to toe dont move too slow
Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
Hes eatin bars yeah wall to wall
Door to door hall to hall
Hes gonna eat em all
Rapture be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Dont strain your brain paint a train
Youll be singin in the rain
Said dont stop to punk rock
Man to man body muscular
Seismic decibel bite the jugular
Wall to wall tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
Cause the man from Mars
Wont eat up bars where the TVs on
Now hes gone back up to space
Where he wont have a hassle with the human race
And you hiphop and you dont stop
Just blast off sure shot
Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin cars
And eatin bars and now he only eats guitars get up
