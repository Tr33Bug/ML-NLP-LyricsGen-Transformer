Rip Her to Shreds Lyrics
Hey, psst-psst, here she comes now

Oh, you know her
Would you look at that hair?
Yeah, you know her
Check out those shoes
She looks like she stepped out of the middle of somebody's blues
She looks like the Sunday comics
She thinks she's Brenda Starr
Her nose job is real atomic
All she needs is an old knife scar
Ew, she's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds

Oh, you know her, "Miss Groupie Supreme"
Yeah, you know her, "Vera Vogue" on parade
Red eye shadow, green mascara
Bleh, she's too much
She looks like she don't know better
A case of partial extreme
Dressed in a Robert Hall sweater
Acting like a soap opera queen

Yeah, she's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds

She got the nerve to tell me she's not on it
But her expression is too serene
Yeah, she looks like she washes with Comet
Always looking to create a scene
You might also like
Yeah, she's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull, come on
Rip her to shreds
She's so dull
Rip her to shreds

Oh, you know her, "Miss Groupie Supreme"
Yeah, you know her, "Vera Vogue" on parade
Yeah, you know her, with the fish-eating grin
She's so dull

Yeah, she got the nerve to tell me
Huh, she's so dull
Hey, there she goes now
She making out with King Kong
She take her boat to Hong Kong
Well
Bye bye, sugar
And not a minute too soon1Embed
