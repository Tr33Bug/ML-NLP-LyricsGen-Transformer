Hey psstpsst here she comes now
Oh you know her
Would you look at that hair
Yeah you know her
Check out those shoes
She looks like she stepped out of the middle of somebodys blues
She looks like the Sunday comics
She thinks shes Brenda Starr
Her nose job is real atomic
All she needs is an old knife scar
Ew shes so dull come on
Rip her to shreds
Shes so dull come on
Rip her to shreds
Oh you know her Miss Groupie Supreme
Yeah you know her Vera Vogue on parade
Red eye shadow green mascara
Bleh shes too much
She looks like she dont know better
A case of partial extreme
Dressed in a Robert Hall sweater
Acting like a soap opera queen
Yeah shes so dull come on
Rip her to shreds
Shes so dull come on
Rip her to shreds
She got the nerve to tell me shes not on it
But her expression is too serene
Yeah she looks like she washes with Comet
Always looking to create a scene


Yeah shes so dull come on
Rip her to shreds
Shes so dull come on
Rip her to shreds
Shes so dull
Rip her to shreds
Oh you know her Miss Groupie Supreme
Yeah you know her Vera Vogue on parade
Yeah you know her with the fisheating grin
Shes so dull
Yeah she got the nerve to tell me
Huh shes so dull
Hey there she goes now
She making out with King Kong
She take her boat to Hong Kong
Well
Bye bye sugar
And not a minute too soon
