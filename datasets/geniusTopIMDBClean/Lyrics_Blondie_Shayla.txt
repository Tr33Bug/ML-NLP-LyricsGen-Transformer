Shayla Lyrics
Shayla worked in a factory
She wasn't history â€” she's just a number
One day, she gets her final pay
And she goes far away

Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa-whoa

Green trees call to me
I am free, but life is so cheap
Scenery is still outside of me
All alone, trapped by its beauty
Shayla turned to run away
To leave in peace and end her stay
Years of fear were in her way
Lost in space, and down she came


Suddenly, some subtle entity
Some cosmic energy brushed her like shadows
Down here, we stop to wonder
Cars on the freeway, bright lights, and thunder

Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa, a-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoaYou might also likeEmbed
