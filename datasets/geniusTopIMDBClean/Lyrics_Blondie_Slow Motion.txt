Whats all that commotion going on
The boy in the back on his second attack
Wants his baby back  wants his baby back 
Whats all that commotion that you hear
The girl in the back who was doing the quake
Got a bellyache she cant concentrate
Pick up the beat you can move like youre made out of vapor
Catch me if you can is what she said with her hands
Come on and take me back  can you take her back 
When she gives you the beat and you get the shine
The world slows down and she stops on a dime
Got a number when you close your eyes
Like a real magician
Still she knows shell never lose a thing
She can put you up on a shelf until she wants to pull the string
Still you know shell never slip away
Keep time in your head counting in your head
Slow motion I can play with time
I can keep today but tomorrows fine
Stop and look at the pictures rolling in your head
Slow motion you can play with time
You can leave her today but tomorrows fine
Stop and live in your dreams at night
Rolling in your bed
Slow motion you can stop on a dime
Slow motion you ought to try it sometime
Take me back on another track
Take me back take me back
Slow motion you can pick up the beat
Slow motion you can stop on the street
Take me back on another track
Take me back take me back
Slow motion you can stop on a dime
Slow motion you ought to try it sometime
Take me back on another track
Take me back take me back
Slow motion you can pick up the beat
Slow motion you can stop on the street
Take me back on another track
Take me back take me back
