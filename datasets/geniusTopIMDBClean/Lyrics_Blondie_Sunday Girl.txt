I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Dry your eyes Sunday Girl
Hey I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like hes in another world
Run and hide Sunday Girl
Hurry up hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues please come see
What your loving means to me
She cant catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and shes feeling proud
Live in dreams Sunday Girl
Baby I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folksll get uptight
Stay at home Sunday Girl
Ooh
Hey I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like hes in another world
Run and hide Sunday Girl
When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sundays girl
Hurry up hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues please come see
What your loving means to me
Hurry up hurry up hurry up and wait
I got the blues please please
Please come see whatcha do to me
I got the blues
Hurry up hurry up hurry up and wait
Hurry up please come see whatcha do to me
