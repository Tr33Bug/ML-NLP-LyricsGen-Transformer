Twenty five tons of hardened steel rolls on no ordinary wheel
Inside the armored car ride two big armed guards
In a bulletproof vest shatterproof glass overdrive were going to pass
Twenty five tons of hardened steel rolls on no ordinary wheel
The hardest part of the armored guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel
Nitro and acetylene open la machine
No short heist no overnight big money take you to Brazil
Bulletproof vest shatterproof glass overdrive were going to pass
Time bomb greasy mob count down hurry up come on
The hardest part of the armored guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel
In a wire mesh cage with a twelve gauge Radio  were coming fast
Ooh I need to feel some hardened steel deliver the big money deal
Of the armored guard heres what I heard
Ill tell you that he will no matter what you feel
The hardest part of the armored guard
Big man of steel behind the steering wheel
Twenty five tons of hardened steel deliver the big money deal
