It cant be
You stole the keys from me
You locked me inside my room of gloom
Its too dark to think that I love you
I think I love you too much
I love you too damn much
Got to go
Cause now im driven
Stop the lies that Ive been living
Got to leave what Ive been given
Get out alive without your love
Got to go
Cause now im driven
Stop the lies that Ive been living
Got to leave what Ive been given
Get out alive without your love
Im not free
I can hardly breath
You locked me outside my heart
Its too dark to think that I love you
I think I love you too much
I love you too damn much
Got to go
Cause now im driven
Stop the lies that Ive been living
Got to leave what Ive been given
Get out alive without your love
Got to go
Cause now im driven
Stop the lies that Ive been living
Got to leave what Ive been given
Get out alive without your love
You want me to be nothing
You want me to be nothing
Without you
I love you too damn much
