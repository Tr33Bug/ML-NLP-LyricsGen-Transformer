I always said you could make it
I know what I said and I meant it
I always liked the way you played guitar
I always knew that someday youd go far
And if you do will anything happen
Will it come true will anything happen
Will I see you again
You said youd be through here again
Please dont forget Im here waiting
You always said that you would never change
Like the people that youve met and the places that youve been
And if you do will anything happen
Will it come true will anything happen
Will I see you again
Will I see you again
I always said you could make it
Just dont forget that I said it
Cause I always liked the way you played guitar
And I always knew that someday youd go far
And if you do will anything happen
Will it come true will anything happen
Will I see you again
Will I see you again
Will I see you again
And if I do will anything happen
