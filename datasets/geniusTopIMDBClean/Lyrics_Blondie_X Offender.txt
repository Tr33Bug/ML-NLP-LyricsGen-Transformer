I saw you standing on the corner
You looked so big and fine
I really wanted to go out with you
So when you smiled
I laid my heart on the line
You read me my rights
And then you said
Lets go and nothing more
I thought of my nights
And how they were
They were filled with
I know you wouldnt go
Youd watch my heart burst
Then youd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh
We sat in the night
With my hands cuffed at my side
I look at your life and your style
I wanted nothing more
I know you wouldnt go
Youd watch my heart burst
Then youd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh
Walking the line you were a marksman
Told me that law like wine is ageless
Public defender
You had to admit
You wanted the love of a sex offender


I know you wouldnt go
Youd watch my heart burst
Then youd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh
My vision in blue
I call you from inside my cell
And in the trial you were there
With your badge and rubber boots
I think all the time how Im going to
Perpetrate love with you
And when I get out theres no doubt
Ill be sex offensive to you
Oohoooh
Oohoohoohooh
