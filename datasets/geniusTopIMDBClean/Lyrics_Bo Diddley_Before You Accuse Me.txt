Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
You say Ive been spending my money on other women
But youve been running with somebody else
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Well your mother said Son dont call my daughter no more
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Well now you say Ive been running around
But youve got somebody else
Come on back home baby try my love one more time
Come on back home baby try my love one more time
Well now youve been gone away so long
Im going to lose my mind
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Oh before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Well now you say Ive been buying another woman clothes
Youve been taking money from somebody else
