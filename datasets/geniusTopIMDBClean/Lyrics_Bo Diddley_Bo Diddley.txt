Bo Diddley bought his babe a diamond ring
If that diamond ring dont shine
He going to take it to a private eye
If that private eye cant see
Hed better not take the ring from me
Bo Diddley caught a nanny goat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley caught a bearcat
To make his pretty baby a Sunday hat
Mojo come to my house you black cat bone
Take my baby away from home
Ugly ole mojo where you been
Up your house and gone again
Bo Diddley Bo Diddley have you heard
My pretty baby said she wasnt for it
