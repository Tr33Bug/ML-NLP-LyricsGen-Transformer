I was sittin in my front room I heard a loud crash
I run to the window to see what was there
Out into trouble my old apple tree
There was a oneeyedpurplepeopleeater lookin at me
He yelled Oohooh bluhbluhbluhbluh
I jumped in my plane and I took to the clouds
I had to go see what the mess all abouta
Athis mess my mother did not understand
All these funny lookin people from another land
He hollered Oohooh bluhbluhbluhbluh
My baby standing in the do and she was hollin real loud
Bo Diddley Bo Diddley dont leave me in this house
I said Take it easy baby you know Ive got to go
I said Lock all the windows and bolt all the dos
She hollered Oohoohooh bluhbluhbluhbluh
Awhen I saw their master boy you oughta see
He was awiggling and agrinnin and astigglin at me
I jumped in my plane and I made it back home
The purplepeopleeaters had my baby and gone
I hollered Oohooh bluhbluhbluhbluh
