I dont want no Cadillac
CADILLAC 
One I got Im going to take it back
CADILLAC 
Come out the house early in the morning
CADILLAC 
Both flat tires didnt give me no warning
CADILLAC 
Ooh ooh Cadillac
Looked in the trunk there wasnt no jack
CADILLAC 
You know Im gonna take this Cadillac back
CADILLAC 
Willie and Lillie come awalking up the street
CADILLAC 
Doing a little wiggle making fun of me
CADILLAC 
Ooh ooh Cadillac
Yeah 
Come to the car but the car wouldnt start
CADILLAC 
Cadillac is breaking my heart
CADILLAC 
Got it started put it into drive
CADILLAC 
Keys to believe in natural lies
CADILLAC 
Ooh ooh  Cadillac
Yeahay
