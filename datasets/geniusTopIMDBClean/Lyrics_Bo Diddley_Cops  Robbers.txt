I was driving home on the boulevard late one night
When I spied a guy over on the corner bummin all alone
Now as I passed him by I heard him holler out hey
I slowed down to see what he said
He hollers By any chance are you going my way
I say Why sho baby hop on in and give me a cigarette
Just then he reached down in his pockets
And that was the moment I regret
He hollered Reach for the sky
I said But I dont understand sir
Dont try no monkey business
Ive got a stopper in my hand
And then he says Lookhere you see this here I got in my hand
This is a thirtyeight pistol built on a fourtyfive frame
Shoots tombstone bullets and a ball and chain
He said Now Im not trying to shake you up
But I just want you to know
If the cops start to crowd me any
You going to be the first to go
So now lookhere dont even look back
You just drive on just like isnt nothing happening
Thats what he told me
He wouldnt even let me look back at nothing
He say when I get to that red light
He wanted me to go to my left and then jump back to my right
He says Now I want you to drive up in that alley
Uhuh not in that alley that that one over there
And cool it behind that liquor store and keep a sharp
Lookout at all times while I sneak in that back door
Thats what he told me
He say keep my foot on the gas and always be on guard
Because when he come running out there with all that money
He wanted me to mash on it real hard
He said now dont let him come out over there
And find me a doublecross
Because hes murder when the heats on


He hollered Reach for the sky
I said But I dont understand sir
Dont try no monkey business
Ive got a stopper in my hand
Oohwee while I was sitting there just tremblin
A spotlight hit me dead in the face
The cop pulled up behind me and said
Move up a little bit man for we want to take your place
And then this guy come running out of the store
With the money in his hand and said Oh there you are
Ha he made a mistake in the dark
And ran and leaped in the police car
When they put the handcuffs on him
I said Child you crime have outgrew him and then they said
Yeah we going to put him so far back in jail this time
Until they going to have to pump air into him
