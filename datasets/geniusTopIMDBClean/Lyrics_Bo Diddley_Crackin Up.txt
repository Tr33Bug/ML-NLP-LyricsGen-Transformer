Crackinâ€™ Up Lyrics
You always hollering about wherever I been
You always screaming about the money I spend
What's bugging you?
(Yeah, yeah, you're cracking up)

I do your laundry and your cooking, too
What, for a woman, can I man like me do?
You're bugging me
(Yeah, yeah, you're cracking up)
I spoiled you woman a long time a go
I used to cook your meals and bring to your door
I'm all fed up
(Yeah, yeah, you bugging me)You might also likeEmbed
