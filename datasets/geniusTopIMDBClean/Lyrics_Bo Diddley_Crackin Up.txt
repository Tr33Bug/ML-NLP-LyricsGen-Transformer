You always hollering about wherever I been
You always screaming about the money I spend
Whats bugging you
Yeah yeah youre cracking up 
I do your laundry and your cooking too
What for a woman can I man like me do
Youre bugging me
Yeah yeah youre cracking up 
I spoiled you woman a long time a go
I used to cook your meals and bring to your door
Im all fed up
Yeah yeah you bugging me
