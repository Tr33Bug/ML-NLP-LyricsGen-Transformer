Diddy Wah
A-diddy Wah

(Diddy Wah)
I got a girl down in Diddy Wah Diddy
(Diddy Wah)
Ain't a town an it ain't no city
(Diddy Wah)
She loves her man, just is a pity
(Diddy Wah)
Crazy about my girl in Diddy Wah Diddy
(Diddy Wah)
This little girl is sweet as she could be
(Diddy Wah)
And I know she's in love with me
(Diddy Wah)
A lovely face, she's so pretty
(Diddy Wah)
But she's still way down in Diddy Wah Diddy

Diddy Wah, Diddy Wah Diddy
Diddy Wah, Diddy Wah Diddy
Diddy Wah, Diddy Wah Diddy
Ain't a town, and it ain't no city
But oh, how they love in Diddy Wah Diddy
Diddy Wah
Diddy Wah
Diddy Wah

(Diddy Wah)
She kissed me all the time
(Diddy Wah)
She's gonna drive me out of my mind
(Diddy Wah)
Anything, she says she's ready
(Diddy Wah)
Headed right back to Diddy Wah Diddy
