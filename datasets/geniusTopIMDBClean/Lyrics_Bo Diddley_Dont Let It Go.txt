All night and the night before
Dont let it go 
Somebody kept aknocking on the door
Dont let it go 
Got up and see what the noise
Dont let it go 
Spot myself a rowdy young boy
Dont let it go 
Put on my hat put on my shoes
Dont let it go 
I ran out the door to see what I could do
Dont let it go 
They were singing a song called
Boohoohoo 
Look out here come the rhythm boys
Boohoohoo 
I was out there shaking their hands
Boohoohoo 
One cat broke out singing Im A Man
Boohoohoo 
Hold on to what you got but dont let go
Dont let it go 
Hold on to what you got but dont let go  yeah yeah 
Dont let it go 
Hold on to what you got but dont let go
Ohoh ohoh ohoh 
Dont let it go 
Hold on to what you got but dont let go
Dont let it go 
Weve changed the tune and start singing a song
Dont let it go 
Boohoohoo 
I like you woman I am not going to do no harm
Boohoohoo 
I said Get away beer boy your minds messed up
Boohoohoo 
She bring me my coffee in her favorite cup
Boohoohoo
