Bo Diddleys a gunslinger
Bo Diddleys a gunslinger
Yeh ahha
Yeh ahha
Ive got a story I really want to tell
About Bo Diddley at the OK corral
Now Bo Diddley didnt stand no mess
He wore a gun on his hip and a rose on his chest
Bo Diddleys a gunslinger
Bo Diddleys a gunslinger
Yeh ahha
Yeh ahha
When Bo Diddley come to town
The streets get empty and the sun go down
Sheriffs standing in the doorway
You know hes so scared to say
Yeh ahha
Yeh ahha
Bo Diddleys a gunslinger
Bo Diddleys a gunslinger
