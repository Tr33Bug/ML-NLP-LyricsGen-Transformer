I got heartomatic love
Stored in my heart
I need a supermatic girl
To give my love a start
I got heartomatic love
We can start off slow
With a love that is true
With sloweromatic love
Speeding just for you
I got heartomatic love
There will be no shiftin
After we start no more detours
On the chart of my heart
I got heartomatic love
If we get stalled
Just give me a shove
Dont leave me stranded
On the highway of love
I got heartomatic love
I got heartomatic love
I got heartomatic love
Whoa got heartomatic love
Oh just heartomatic love
