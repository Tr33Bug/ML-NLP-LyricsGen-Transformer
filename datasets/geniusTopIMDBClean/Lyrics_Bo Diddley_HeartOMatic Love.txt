Heart-O-Matic Love LyricsI got heart-o-matic love
Stored in my heart
I need a supermatic girl
To give my love a start
I got heart-o-matic love
We can start off slow
With a love that is true
With slower-o-matic love
Speeding just for you
I got heart-o-matic love
There will be no shiftin'
After we start, no more detours
On the chart of my heart
I got heart-o-matic love
If we get stalled
Just give me a shove
Don't leave me stranded
On the highway of love
I got heart-o-matic love
I got heart-o-matic love
I got heart-o-matic love
Whoa, got heart-o-matic love
Oh, just heart-o-matic loveYou might also likeEmbed
