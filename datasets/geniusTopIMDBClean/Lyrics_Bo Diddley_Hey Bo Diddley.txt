Bo Diddley done had a farm
Hey Bo Diddley 
On that farm he had some women
Hey Bo Diddley 
Women here and women there
Hey Bo Diddley 
Women women women everywhere
Hey Bo Diddley 
But one little girl lived on a hill
Hey Bo Diddley 
She rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill
Hey Bo Diddley 
One day she decided shed go for a ride
Hey Bo Diddley 
With a pistol and a sword by her side
Hey Bo Diddley 
She rolled right up to my front door
Hey Bo Diddley 
Knocked and knocked until her fist got sore
Hey Bo Diddley 
When she turned and walked away
Hey Bo Diddley 
All I could hear my baby say
Hey Bo Diddley 
Hey Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley 
Oh Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley 
Hey Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley 
Oh Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley 
Saw my baby run across the field
Hey Bo Diddley 
Slipping and sliding like an automobile
Hey Bo Diddley 
Hollering my baby got towed away
Hey Bo Diddley 
Slipped on from me like a Cadillac8
Hey Bo Diddley 
Hey Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley 
Oh Bo Diddley
Oh Bo Diddley 
Hey Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley
