Oh  hush your mouth 
Hey little baby dont you cry
Mama going to drop around by and by
Hey little baby dont say a word
Mama going to whoop you about something you heard
Mama going to buy you a diamond ring
If that diamond rings brass
Mama going to buy a looking glass
If that looking glass is broke
Mama going to buy a horse and coach
If that horse and coach turn over
Mama going to buy you a dog named Rover
Oh  hush your mouth 
A coonskin alligator hide
Make into shoes baby just like mine
Dont be scared to put them on your feet
Scared about me just cant be beat
Hush your mouth
