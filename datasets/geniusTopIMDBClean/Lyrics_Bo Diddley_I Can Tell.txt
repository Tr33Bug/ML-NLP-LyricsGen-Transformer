I can tell because its plain to see
I can tell the way you look at me
The way you know you hold my hand
Yes pretty baby I can understand
I can tell I can tell
I know you dont love me no more
No more no more
I can tell I can tell
I know you dont love me no more
I asked your Mama and your Papa too
What more can a poor man do
Now you been running with a heart breaker child around
Heres a new bounce that you put me down
I can tell I can tell
I know you dont love me no more
Well you wont answer your telephone
When I knock on your door they say that you arent home
Your sister let me in and tell me I can wait
When you come home you show up real late
Now I can tell I can tell
I know you dont love me no more
No more
I said No more
No more
Baby I can give you romance
Only if you give me another chance
Ill cook your food and Ill wash your clothes
I promise will keep your warm when it get cold


I can tell
I know you dont love me no more
No more
