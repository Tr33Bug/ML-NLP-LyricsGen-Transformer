I Need You Baby  Mona  Lyrics
Hey Mona
Ooh Mona
Yes yes yeah yeah Mona
Ooh Mona
Tell you Mona what I want to do
Build a house next door to you
Get out and see you sometime
We can go kissing through the blinds
Can you come out in the front
Listen to my heart go bumpetybump
I need you baby thats no lie
Without your love I would surely die
Yeah Mona
Oh Mona
Hey oh oh Mona
Hey Mona
Hey Mona
Oh Mona
Can you come out on the front
Listen to my heart go bumpetybump
I need you baby thats no lie
Without your love I would surely die
