Iâ€™m Bad LyricsI spell B-A-D
I'm bad
That means no messing me
Now all you women
Remember when I was twenty-one?
That was a year, baby
That I had a-lots of fun
But a year has gone by
I'm now twenty-two
I can eat nails, honey
And drink gunpowder soup
I spell B-A-D
I'm bad
That means no messing me
Now, honey you better tell your husband
Quit sneaking, peeping at me
He wanna fight off the man
That I'm the supposed to be
I'll make sure the drill's running
And mess up his face
I'll even try to snatch both of
His legs outta place
B-A-D, bad
One more question, honey
Before I start to stutter
I can even tell you why
White milk make yellow butter
I'm B-A-D, bad
You ask me, honey
What it was all about
You even asked me where the light went
When it went out
You might also likeI'm B-A-D
I'm bad
Don't mess with me
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Wha-hoo
Wha-hooEmbed
