I spell BAD
Im bad
That means no messing me
Now all you women
Remember when I was twentyone
That was a year baby
That I had alots of fun
But a year has gone by
Im now twentytwo
I can eat nails honey
And drink gunpowder soup
I spell BAD
Im bad
That means no messing me
Now honey you better tell your husband
Quit sneaking peeping at me
He wanna fight off the man
That Im the supposed to be
Ill make sure the drills running
And mess up his face
Ill even try to snatch both of
His legs outta place
BAD bad
One more question honey
Before I start to stutter
I can even tell you why
White milk make yellow butter
Im BAD bad
You ask me honey
What it was all about
You even asked me where the light went
When it went out

Im BAD
Im bad
Dont mess with me
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
Whahoo
Whahoo
