Iâ€™m Looking For A Woman Lyrics
I'm looking for woman
That will work and set me down
I'm looking for a woman
That will work and set me down
I've been looking all night long
She can't be found
Well, I met one last night
And I told her what I liked
Well, I met one last night
And I told her what I liked
She said, "Get away from here, country boy
Go back to your countryside"
Well, tell me, baby
What you see wrong with me?
Well, tell me, baby
What you see wrong with me?
Well, if I had you baby
Be good, you didn't  back at me
Well, so long Mama
Baby, bye, bye, you, bye
Well, so long Mama
Baby, bye, bye, you, bye
Well, now bye, bye baby
With those tears in your eyesYou might also likeEmbed
