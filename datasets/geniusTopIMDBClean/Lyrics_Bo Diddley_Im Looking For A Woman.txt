Im looking for woman
That will work and set me down
Im looking for a woman
That will work and set me down
Ive been looking all night long
She cant be found
Well I met one last night
And I told her what I liked
Well I met one last night
And I told her what I liked
She said Get away from here country boy
Go back to your countryside
Well tell me baby
What you see wrong with me
Well tell me baby
What you see wrong with me
Well if I had you baby
Be good you didnt  back at me
Well so long Mama
Baby bye bye you bye
Well so long Mama
Baby bye bye you bye
Well now bye bye baby
With those tears in your eyes
