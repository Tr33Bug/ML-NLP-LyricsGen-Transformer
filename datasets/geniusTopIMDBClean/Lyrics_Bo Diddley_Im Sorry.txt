Im sorry oh Im sorry
Oh baby Im sorry for the things I said to you
You know I love you you know I care
With you my new heart I want to share
Darling I need you with all your heart and soul
To know that I want you and Ill never never let you go
But forgive me please forgive me
Please forgive me for I knew not what I was saying
Come on little baby come on darling
Give me another chance to make up on my wrong
You know that I love you you know Ill put nobody else above you
Come on come on say that youll love me
Im sorry oh yes Im sorry
Oh Im sorry for the things Ive said to you
