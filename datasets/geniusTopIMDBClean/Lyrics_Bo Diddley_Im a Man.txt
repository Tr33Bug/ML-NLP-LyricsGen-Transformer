Now when I was a little boy
At the age of five
I had somethin in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive
Now Im a man
Made twentyone
You know baby
We can have a lot of fun
Im a man
Aspelled MAN
Man
Ahoh ahoh ahoh ahoh
All you pretty women
Stand in line
I can make love to you baby
In an hours time
Im a man
Spelled MAN
Man
I goin back down
To Kansas soon
Bring back the second cousin
Little Johnny Cocheroo
Im a man
Spelled MAN
Man
Ohoh ahoh ahoh ahoh


The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to em
They cant resist
Im a man
I spell MAN
Man
