Little Girl Lyrics
Little girl, I go home with you
You know pretty baby
Crazy about the things you do
Tell me baby, tell me your name
You know pretty mama
You're beautiful thing
Little girl, can I go home with you?
I like the way, the way you walk
Crazy about the things baby, you talk
Little girl, let me go home with you
Tell your mama, your papa, too
How much I, love with you
Little girl, let me go home with you
I asked baby, about twenty-one
You know pretty mama
We could have a lot of fun
Little girl, later I go home with you
You asked baby, about twenty-two
I'd just like to make love to you
Well, little girl
Can I go home with you?You might also likeEmbed
