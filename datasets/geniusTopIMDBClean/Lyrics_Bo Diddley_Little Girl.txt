Little girl I go home with you
You know pretty baby
Crazy about the things you do
Tell me baby tell me your name
You know pretty mama
Youre beautiful thing
Little girl can I go home with you
I like the way the way you walk
Crazy about the things baby you talk
Little girl let me go home with you
Tell your mama your papa too
How much I love with you
Little girl let me go home with you
I asked baby about twentyone
You know pretty mama
We could have a lot of fun
Little girl later I go home with you
You asked baby about twentytwo
Id just like to make love to you
Well little girl
Can I go home with you
