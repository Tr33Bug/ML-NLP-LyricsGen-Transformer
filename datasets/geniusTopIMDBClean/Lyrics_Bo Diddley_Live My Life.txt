You got to live my life all over again
You got to live my life I live it all over again

If I only knew what I know now
If I knew if I know what I know now
The woman is growing with me she can never put me down

Yea gonna buy me a  ride all over the world
Well Im gonna buy me some sweet little girl
Baby baby baby now
Baby baby baby now
You know that I love and I can never ever put you down
