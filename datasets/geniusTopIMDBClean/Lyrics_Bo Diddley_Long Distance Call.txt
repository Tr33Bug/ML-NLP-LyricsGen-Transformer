You say you love me darling
Please call me on the phone sometime
You say you love me darling
Please call me on the phone sometime
When I hear your voice
Ease my worried mind
One of these days
Im going to show you how nice a man can be
One of these days
Im going to show you just how nice a man can be
Im going to buy you a brand new Cadillac
If you only speak some good words about me
Hear my phone ringing
Sound like a long distance call
Hear my phone keep ringing
Sound like a long distance call
When I picked up my receiver
The party said another mule kicking in your stall
