Dont you love her madly woo
Dont you need her badly
Dont you love her ways
Tell me what you say
Dont you love her madly
Wanna be her daddy
Dont you love her face
Dont you love her as she
Walked out the door
Like she did so many thousand times before
Dont you love her ways
Tell me what you say
Dont you love her as she
Walked out the door
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem
To be on the mark
Yeah dont you love her
Dont you love her
As she walked out the door
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem
To be on the mark
Dont you love her madly
Dont you need her badly
Dont you love her ways
Tell me what you say
Dont you love her madly
Dont you love her madly yeah
Dont you love her madly
Dont you love her madly
Dont you love her madly
Tell me what you say
