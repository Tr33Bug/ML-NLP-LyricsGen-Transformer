Mona LyricsHey, Mona, Mona
Hey, hey hey hey, Mona, oh Mona
Hey, Mona what I wanna do
Build my house next door to you
Can I see you sometime
We can talk just through the blind
Can you come out in the front
Listen to my heart goin' bum pity bump
I need you baby that's no lie
Without your love I'll surely die
Hey hey, Mona, Mona
Hey hey hey hey, Mona, hey Mona
Hey hey, Mona, Mona
Can you come out on the front
Listen to my heart goin' bum pity bump
Need you baby that's no lie
Without your love I'll surely dieYou might also likeEmbed
