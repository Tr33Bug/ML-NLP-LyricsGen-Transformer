Oh Yea Lyrics
I've got a little woman
She isn't very tall
She says she loves me
Me, best of all
She's my woman
All in all
She's my lover
And she's my ball
I roll around
I have a lot of fun
She always whispers to me, softly
Said, 'Bo Diddley, you the one'
Oh, yea
Sho' nuff'
I hold her in my arms
And I kiss her real gentle
She says, 'Mmm, my'
I'm feeling real red hot'
Take it easy, baby
Your temperature running hot!
You going to stagger after me, wondering
A-baby, what you gots
You my ball
You my rubber ball
Mmm-mmm
Whoa, yea
Oh, yea
I picked up the telephone
And called her pa at home
He said, 'Hey, little boy'
'You better let my daughter alone'
I says, 'Oh, yea'
He says, Oh, yea'
I says, 'Um-hmm'
He says, 'You know, yeah'

Her mother got mad
And started to jump and shout
They started to run down there
And have the cops to carry me out

I says, 'Oh, yea'
She says, 'Um-hmm'
I says, 'Oh, yea'
Her pop says, 'Sho nuff'

I says, 'But I love her'
I love herYou might also likeEmbed
