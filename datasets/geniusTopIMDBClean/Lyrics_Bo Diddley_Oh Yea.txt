Ive got a little woman
She isnt very tall
She says she loves me
Me best of all
Shes my woman
All in all
Shes my lover
And shes my ball
I roll around
I have a lot of fun
She always whispers to me softly
Said Bo Diddley you the one
Oh yea
Sho nuff
I hold her in my arms
And I kiss her real gentle
She says Mmm my
Im feeling real red hot
Take it easy baby
Your temperature running hot
You going to stagger after me wondering
Ababy what you gots
You my ball
You my rubber ball
Mmmmmm
Whoa yea
Oh yea
I picked up the telephone
And called her pa at home
He said Hey little boy
You better let my daughter alone
I says Oh yea
He says Oh yea
I says Umhmm
He says You know yeah
Her mother got mad
And started to jump and shout
They started to run down there
And have the cops to carry me out
I says Oh yea
She says Umhmm
I says Oh yea
Her pop says Sho nuff
I says But I love her
I love her
