One kiss from your lips
Set my soul on fire
The touch of your hand
Drives me wild
Now Ill know
Our love will never go
So darling as I lay here in my bed
Dreaming and thinking
All the things you said
But now I know
Our love will never go
So give me one chance to prove my love
Ill do anything for you
Your love Ill love
I I I know
Our love will never go
One kiss from your lips
Drives me wild
Sets my soul on fire
