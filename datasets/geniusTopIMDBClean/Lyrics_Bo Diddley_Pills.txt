While I was laying in a hospital bed
A rock and roll nurse went through my head
She says hold out your arm stick out you tongue
I got some pills boy Im going to give you one
She went through my head through my head
Through my head through my head
She went to my head through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bed
She gave me thrills from my toes
For legging ache
She gave me pills from her love
But a little too late
She gave me pills for my heart
To put me at ease
The rock and roll nurse
Shook me dead to my knees
She went through my head through my head
Through my head through my head
She went to my head through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bed
Nurses nurses cant you see
I dont dig this jive you giving me
Give me your pill or give me your shot
You got me wondering what what have I got
She went through my head through my head
Through my head through my head
She went to my head through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bed


Doctor doctor run here and see
I dont dig this jive this nurse giving me
She gimme a shot she give me you pills
Im taking this junk against my will
She went through my head through my head
Through my head through my head
She went to my head through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bed
