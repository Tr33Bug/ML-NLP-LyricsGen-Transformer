Pills Lyrics
While I was laying in a hospital bed
A rock and roll nurse went through my head
She says, hold out your arm, stick out you tongue
I got some pills, boy, I'm going to give you one

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, through my head
She went to my head, through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bed
She gave me thrills from my toes
For legging ache
She gave me pills from her love
But a little too late
She gave me pills for my heart
To put me at ease
The rock and roll nurse
Shook me dead to my knees

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, through my head
She went to my head, through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bed

Nurses, nurses, can't you see
I don't dig this jive you giving me?
Give me your pill or give me your shot
You got me wondering what, what have I got?

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, through my head
She went to my head, through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bed
You might also like
Doctor, doctor, run here and see
I don't dig this jive this nurse giving me
She gimme a shot, she give me you pills
I'm taking this junk against my will

She went through my head, through my head
Through my head, through my head
She went to my head, through my head
While I was laying in a hospital bedEmbed
