You pretty thing
Let me buy you a wedding ring
Let me hear the choir sing
Oh you pretty thing
You pretty thing
Let me walk you down the aisle
Darling where our love is found
Oh you pretty thing
Let me kiss you gentle
Squeeze and hug you tight
Let me give you all my love
The rest of my life
You pretty thing
Let me hold you by my side
And become my blushing bride
You pretty thing
Pretty thing
Let me dedicate my life
You will always be my wife
Oh you pretty thing
