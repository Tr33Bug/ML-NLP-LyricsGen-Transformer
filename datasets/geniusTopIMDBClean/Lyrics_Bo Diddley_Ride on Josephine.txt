Ride on Josephine Lyrics
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a running machine
Ah baby, baby, ride on Josephine, baby ride on

Well, Josephine driving a hot rod Ford
Twin carburetor will eat up the road
Twin exhaust sticking out the rear
Something that will really take away from here
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, you got a running machine
Baby, baby, ride on Josephine, baby ride on

Josephine's Ford begin to run hot
She tried to trade it in at a used car lot
The man couldn't believe his natural eyes
When she pulled it in to his drive

Ride on, Josephine, ride on
Say, Josephine! (Ride on Josephine, ride on)
Josephine, child, your tank is leaking gas!
(Ride on Josephine, ride on)
Say what?
Baby, you better shut up and come on ride with me
Ye-aah, you better ride with me

You say I better mind my business?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You got business baby, you, you good business!
I just lo-oo-oo-ve good business!
You say, what kind of car I driving? (maroon '40 Ford)
Well, I-I'm a I'm driving a '48 Cadillac with Thunderbird wings
Telling you baby, that's a running thing
I got wings that'll open and get her in the air
I think I can take it away from here

Ride on, Josephine, ride on
Ride on, Josephine, ride on
Ride on, Josephine, child, you got a running machine
Baby, baby, ride on Josephine, baby ride on

Well, I bl, bl, believe you, baby
Because you-a, you-a, you ain't been flagged
I'm going
Goodbye!Embed
