Road Runner Lyrics
I'm a road runner, honey
Beep, beep
Beep, beep
Ah, beep, beep

I'm a road runner honey
And you can't keep up with me
I'm a road runner honey
And you can't keep up with me
Come on, let's race (Ahh)
Baby baby, you and me
Here I come
Beep, beep

Move over, honey, let me by
Move over, baby, let this man by
I'm going to show you, baby (Ahh)
Look out your head
Going to put some dirt in your eye
Here I go
Oh, yeah, how am I doing?
Beep, beep
Take my hand, baby
I'm going to prove to you
That I'm a road running man
I want to show you something
That I'm the fastest in the land
Now, let me by (Ahh)
Beep, beep
Oh, yeah, you said you's fast
Ha ha ha ha but it don't look like you going to last
Goodbye, I've got to put you down
I'll see you someday (Ahh)
Baby, somewhere hanging aroundYou might also likeEmbed
