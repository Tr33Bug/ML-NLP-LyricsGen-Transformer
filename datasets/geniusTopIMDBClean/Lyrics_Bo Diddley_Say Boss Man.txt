Ahuhhuh  aum 
I got nineteen kids at home got to eat
Eighteen of them need shoes on their feet
Boss man cant you see
All nineteen kids Ive got to feed
Oohooohhooh
Oohhooohoh
Early this morning landlord knock on doors
Dont pay the rent boy you got to go
Three days three months in arrears
Five days notice you move away from here
Worked all day any overtime
Nineteen kids drive me out of my mind
Place I used to work they went on a strike
No use trying theyll never take me back
Ahuhhuh  aum 
Ahuhhuh  ahuhhuh move  hey   aum   hey 
Never going to move  hey   aum   hey 
Ahuhhuh  I got to move  aum 
Ahuhhuh  uhhuhhuh
