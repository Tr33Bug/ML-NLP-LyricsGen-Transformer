People say a man is made out of mud
Poor man made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind thats aweak and a back thats strong
You load sixteen tons what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter dont you call me because I cant go
Owe my soul to the company store
I was born one morning when the sun didnt shine
I picked up my shovel and I started to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
The straw boss said Well now bless his soul
He loaded sixteen tons and what did he get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter dont you call me because I cant go
Owe my soul to the company store
You see me coming you better step aside
A lotta men didnt and a lot of of them died
One fist of iron the other one of steel
The right one dont get you then the left one will
You load sixteen tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter dont you call me because I cant go
Owe my soul to the company store
