The great grandpappy when the land was young
Barred his door with a wagon tongue
Oh ohhohohoho
When the times got tough and redskins smart
Said his prayers with his shotgun cocked
Oh oh ohohoh ohoh
The great grandpappy was a busy man
Cooked his grub in a frying pan
Picked his teeth with a hunting knife
He wore the same suit all of his life
Ohoh ohoohoohoohooh ayy ayy oh
Twentyone children came to be blessed
The old mans house in the wilderness
Ohoh ohohoh
Doubt his story if you can
The great grandpappy was a busy man
Oh oh ohohoh oh ow oh
