I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobrasnake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made from rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
Now come on take a little walk with me Arlene
And tell me who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
Just 22 and I dont mind dying
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
I rode a lion into town use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene dont give me no lip
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Night was dark but the sky was blue
Down the alley a icewagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed
You should have heard just what I seen


Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Arlene took me by my hand
She said Oohee Bo you know I understand
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
