You cant judge an apple by lookin at a tree
You cant judge honey by lookin at the bee
You cant judge a daughter by lookin at the mother
You cant judge a book by lookin at the cover
Oh cant you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But Im a lover
Cant judge a book by lookin at the cover oh
Oh come on in closer baby
Hear what else I gotta say
You got your radio turned down too low
Turn it up
Ow
You cant judge sugar by lookin at the cane
You cant judge a woman by lookin at her man
You cant judge a sister by lookin at her brother
You cant judge a book by lookin at the cover
Oh cant you see
Oh you misjudge me
I look like a farmer
But Im a lover
Cant judge a book by lookin at the cover come on
Ah how am I doin baby
Yeah
You cant judge a fish by lookin in the pond
You cant judge right from lookin at the wrong
You cant judge one by lookin at the other
You cant judge a book by lookin at the cover


Oh cant you see
Oh you cant judge me
Play like a farmer
But Im a lover
Cant judge a book by lookin at the cover
