You Dont Love Me  You Dont Care  Lyrics
You dont love me you dont care
You dont want me hanging round here
Hanging round here hanging round here
Well I love you yes I do
Isnt nothing in the world I woudnt do for you
I wouldnt do for you wouldnt do for you I wouldnt do for you
Yes I saw you on the street
Tell you man you didnt love me you didnt love me
You didnt love me you didnt love me
Yes I need you yes I do
You know pretty mama what Ill try for you
What Ill try for you what Ill try for you
What Ill try for you what Ill try for you
What Ill try for you what Ill try for you
What Ill try for you what Ill try for you
