Im sorry
Oh Im sorry
Oh baby Im sorry
For the things I said to you
You know I love you
You know I care
With you my new heart I want to share
Darling I need you
With all your heart and soul
To know that I want you and Ill never let you go
But forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
For I knew not what I was sayin
Come on little baby
Come on darling
Give me another chance
To make up on my wrong
You know that I love you
You know Ill put nobody else above you
Come on come on
Say that youll love me
Im sorry
Oh yes Im sorry
Oh Im sorry
For the things I said t you
