4th of July Asbury Park  Sandy  Lyrics
Sandy the fireworks are hailing over Little Eden tonight
Forcing a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm July
Down in the town the Circuits full of switchblade lovers so fast so shiny so sharp
As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on the shore
Chasing all them silly New York virgins by the score
And Sandy the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh love me tonight for I may never see you again
Hey Sandy girl
My my baby
Now the greasers ah they tramp the streets
Or get busted for sleeping on the beach all night
Them boys in their high heels ah Sandy
Their skins are so white
And me I just got tired of hanging in them dusty arcades banging them pleasure machines
Chasing the factory girls underneath the boardwalk
Where they all promise to unsnap their jeans
And you know that tiltawhirl down on the south beach drag
I got on it last night and my shirt got caught
And they kept me spinning babe didnt think Id ever get off
Oh Sandy the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life on the water
Running laughing neath the boardwalk
Ah with the boss daughter
I remember Sandy girl
Na na na na na baby
Sandy that waitress I was seeing lost her desire for me
I spoke with her last night she said she wont set herself on fire for me anymore
She worked that joint under the boardwalk
She was always the girl you saw bopping down the beach with the radio
The kids say last night she was dressed like a star
In one of them cheap little seaside bars
And I saw her parked with lover boy out on the Kokomo
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie
For tellin fortunes better than they do
For me this boardwalk lifes through babe
You ought to quit this scene too


Sandy the aurora is rising behind us
This pier lights our carnival life forever
Oh love me tonight and I promise Ill love you forever
Oh I mean it Sandy girl
My my my my my baby
Yeah I promise Sandy girl
Sha la la la la baby
