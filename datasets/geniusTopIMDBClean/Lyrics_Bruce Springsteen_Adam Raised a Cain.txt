Adam Raised a Cain Lyrics
In the summer that I was baptized
My father held me to his side
As they put me to the water
He said how on that day I cried

We were prisoners of love, a love in chains
He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain
With the same hot blood burning in our veins
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain

All of the old faces
Ask you why you're back
They fit you with position
And the keys to your daddy's Cadillac

In the darkness of your room
Your mother calls you by your true name
You remember the faces, the places, the names
You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain

Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain

In the Bible brother Cain slew Abel
And East of Eden mama he was cast
You're born into this life paying
For the sins of somebody else's past
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame
But you inherit the sins, you inherit the flames

Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Lost but not forgotten, from the dark heart of a dream
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a CainYou might also like1Embed
