In the summer that I was baptized
My father held me to his side
As they put me to the water
He said how on that day I cried
We were prisoners of love a love in chains
He was standin in the door I was standin in the rain
With the same hot blood burning in our veins
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
All of the old faces
Ask you why youre back
They fit you with position
And the keys to your daddys Cadillac
In the darkness of your room
Your mother calls you by your true name
You remember the faces the places the names
You know its never over its relentless as the rain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
In the Bible brother Cain slew Abel
And East of Eden mama he was cast
Youre born into this life paying
For the sins of somebody elses past
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame
But you inherit the sins you inherit the flames
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
Adam raised a Cain
