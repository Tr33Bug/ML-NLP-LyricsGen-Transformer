American Skin  41 Shots  Lyrics
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots and well take that ride
Across the bloody river to the other side
Fortyone shots cut through the night
Youre kneeling over his body in the vestibule
Praying for his life
Is it a gun Is it a knife
Is it a wallet This is your life
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
No secret my friend
You can get killed just for living in your American skin
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots Lena gets her son ready for school
She says On these streets Charles
Youve got to understand the rules
If an officer stops you promise me youll always be polite
And that youll never ever run away
Promise Mama youll keep your hands in sight
Is it a gun Is it a knife
Is it a wallet This is your life
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
No secret my friend
You get killed just for living in your American skin
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Fortyone shots 
Is it a gun Is it a knife
Is it in your heart Is it in your eyes
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
Fortyone shots and well take that ride
Across this bloody river to the other side
Fortyone shots I got my boots caked in this mud
Were baptized in these waters  Were baptized in these waters 
And in each others blood  And in each others blood 
Is it a gun Is it a knife
Is it a wallet This is your life
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
It aint no secret  It aint no secret 
No secret my friend
You get killed just for living in
You get killed just for living in
You get killed just for living in your American skin
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living 
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living 
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living 
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living 
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living 
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living 
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living 
Fortyone shots  You get killed just for living
