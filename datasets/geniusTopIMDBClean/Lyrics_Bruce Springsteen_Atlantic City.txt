Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
And they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk theyre getting ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now theres trouble busing in from out of state
And the DA cant get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gambling commissions hanging on by the skin of its teeth
Well now everything dies baby thats a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
Well now everything dies baby thats a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
But with you forever Ill stay
Were going out where the sands turning to gold
So put on your stockings baby cause the nights getting cold
And everything dies baby thats a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Now I been looking for a job but its hard to find
Down here its just winners and losers and Dont get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well Im tired of coming out on the losing end
So honey last night I met this guy and Im gonna do a little favor for him
Well now everything dies baby thats a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
