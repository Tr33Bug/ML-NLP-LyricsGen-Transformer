Lights out tonight trouble in the heartland
Got a headon collision smashin in my guts man
Im caught in a crossfire that I dont understand
But theres one thing I know for sure girl
I dont give a damn for the same old playedout scenes
Baby I dont give a damn for just the inbetweens
Honey I want the heart I want the soul I want control right now
You better listen to me baby
Talk about a dream try to make it real
You wake up in the night with a fear so real
You spend your life waiting for a moment that just dont come
Well dont waste your time waiting
Badlands you gotta live it everyday
Let the broken hearts stand as the price youve gotta pay
Well keep pushin till its understood
And these badlands start treating us good
Workin in the fields till you get your back burned
Workin neath the wheel till you get your facts learned
Baby I got my facts learned real good right now
You better get it straight darling
Poor man wanna be rich rich man wanna be king
And a king aint satisfied till he rules everything
I wanna go out tonight I wanna find out what I got
Well I believe in the love that you gave me
I believe in the faith that could save me
I believe in the hope and I pray that some day
It may raise me above these


Badlands you gotta live it everyday
Let the broken hearts stand as the price youve gotta pay
Well keep pushin till its understood
And these badlands start treating us good
For the ones who had a notion a notion deep inside
That it aint no sin to be glad youre alive
I wanna find one face that aint looking through me
I wanna find one place I wanna spit in the face of these
Badlands you gotta live it everyday
Let the broken hearts stand as the price youve gotta pay
Keep movin till its understood
And these badlands start treating us good
