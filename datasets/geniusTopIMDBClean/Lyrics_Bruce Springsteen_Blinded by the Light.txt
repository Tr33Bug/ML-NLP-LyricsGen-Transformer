Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder feelin kinda older I tripped the
Merrygoround
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope
Crashed to the ground
Some allhot halfshot was headin for the hot spot snappin his fingers clappin his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lovers knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forgetmenot whispers daddys within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band
And she was blinded by the light
Oh cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight but shell make it alright
Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
He says Dethrone the dictaphone hit it in its funny bone thats where they expect it least
And some newmown chaperone was standin in the corner all alone watchin the young girls dance
And some freshsown moonstone was messin with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance
Yeah he was blinded by the light
Oh cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but she never got tight but hes gonna make it tonight
Some silicone sister with her managers mister told me I got what it takes
She said Ill turn you on sonny to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And gocart Mozart was checkin out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little EarlyPearly came in by her curlywurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin backyard bombardier
Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard they sent some dude with a calling card
He said do what you like but dont do it here
Well I jumped up turned around spit in the air fell on the ground
Asked him which was the way back home
He said take a right at the light keep goin straight until night and then boy youre on your own


And now in Zanzibar a shootin star was ridin in a side car hummin a lunar tune
Yes and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar were gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw
A gap but figured hed be all right
He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Woah but but mama thats where the fun is
I was blinded
Oh mama oh mama
I was blinded
Oh mama oh mama
I was blinded by the light
I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded by the light
I was blinded
I was blinded by the light
I was blinded
I was blinded
