In the day we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled fuel injected and steppin out over the line
Oh baby this town rips the bones from your back
Its a death trap its a suicide rap
We gotta get out while were young
Cause tramps like us baby we were born to run
Yes girl we were
Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
Well run till we drop baby well never go back
Oh will you walk with me out on the wire
Cause baby Im just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh can you show me
Beyond the palace hemipowered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
1 2 3 4  The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybodys out on the run tonight
But theres no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
Ill love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh someday girl I dont know when
Were gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go and well walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us
Baby we were born to run
Oh honey tramps like us
Baby we were born to run
Come on with me tramps like us
Baby we were born to run
