I hold you in my arms as the band plays
What are those words whispered baby just as you turn away
I saw you last night out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind to know just what Ive got in this new thing Ive found
So tell me what I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise
I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow
Well Ive tried so hard baby but I just cant see
What a woman like you is doing with me
So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise
Now look at me baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
Im just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if its you I dont trust
Cause I damn sure dont trust myself
Now you play the loving woman Ill play the faithful man
But just dont look too close into the palm of my hand
We stood at the altar the gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours well maybe baby the gypsy lied
So when you look at me you better look hard and look twice
Is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise
Tonight our bed is cold
Im lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what hes sure of
