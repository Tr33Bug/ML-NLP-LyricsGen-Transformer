I get up in the evening
And I aint got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I aint nothing but tired
Man Im just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little help
You cant start a fire
You cant start a fire without a spark
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Messages keep getting clearer
Radios on and Im moving round my place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes my hair my face
Man I aint getting nowhere
Im just living in a dump like this
Theres something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is
You cant start a fire
You cant start a fire without a spark
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
You sit around getting older
Theres a joke here somewhere and its on me
Ill shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby the laughs on me
Stay on the streets of this town
And theyll be carving you up all right
They say You gotta stay hungry
Hey baby Im just about starving tonight
Im dying for some action
Im sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby give me just one look
You cant start a fire
Sitting round crying over a broken heart
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
You cant start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Hey baby
