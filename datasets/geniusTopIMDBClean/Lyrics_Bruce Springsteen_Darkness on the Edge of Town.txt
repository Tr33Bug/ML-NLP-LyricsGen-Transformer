Well theyre still racing out at the Trestles
But that blood it never burned in her veins
Now I hear shes got a house up in Fairview
And a style shes trying to maintain
Well if she wants to see me
You can tell her that Im easily found
Tell her theres a spot out neath Abrams Bridge
And tell her
Theres a darkness on the edge of town
Theres a darkness on the edge of town
Well everybodys got a secret son
Something that they just cant face
Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it
They carry it with them every step that they take
Till some day they just cut it loose
Cut it loose or let it drag em down
Where no one asks any questions
Or looks too long in your face
In the darkness on the edge of town
In the darkness on the edge of town
Some folks are born into a good life
And other folks get it anyway anyhow
Well then I lost my money and I lost my wife
Them things dont seem to matter much to me now
Tonight Ill be on that hill cause I cant stop
Ill be on that hill with everything I got
Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost
Ill be there on time and Ill pay the cost
For wanting things that can only be found
In the darkness on the edge of town
In the darkness on the edge of town
