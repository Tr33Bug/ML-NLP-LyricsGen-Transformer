Driving in to Darlington County
Me and Wayne on the Fourth of July
Driving in to Darlington County
Looking for some work on the county line
We drove down from New York City
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name
Driving in to Darlington City
Got a union connection with an uncle of Waynes
We drove 800 miles without seeing a cop
We got rock and roll music blasting off the ttop singing
Sha la la sha la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la sha la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Hey little girl standing on the corner
Todays your lucky day for sure all right
Me and my buddy were from New York City
We got 200 we want to rock all night
Girl youre looking at two big spenders
Why the world dont know what me and Wayne might do
Our pas each own one of the World Trade Centers
For a kiss and a smile Ill give mine all to you
Come on baby take a seat on my fender
Its a long night and tell me what else were you gonna do
Just me and you we could
Sha la la sha la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Sha la la sha la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Little girl sitting in the window
Aint seen my buddy in seven days
County man tells me the same thing
He dont work and he dont get paid
Little girl youre so young and pretty
Walk with me and you can have your way
And well leave this Darlington City
For a ride down that Dixie Highway


Driving out of Darlington County
My eyes seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
Driving out of Darlington County
Seen Wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state troopers Ford
