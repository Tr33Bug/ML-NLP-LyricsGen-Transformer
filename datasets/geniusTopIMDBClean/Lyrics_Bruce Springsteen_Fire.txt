Im driving in my car
I turn on the radio
Im pulling you close
You just say no
You say you dont like it
But girl I know youre a liar
Cause when we kiss
Ooooh Fire
Late at night
Im takin you home
I say I wanna stay
You say you wanna be alone
You say you dont love me
But you cant hide your desire
And when we kiss
Oh Fire
Fire
You got a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldnt tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin
Actin like a fool
Well your kisses they burn
But your heart stays cool
Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
You can bet
Their love they couldnt deny
Your words say split
But your words they lie
When we kiss
Mmmmmm Fire
Fire
You got a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldnt tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin
Actin like a fool
Your kisses they burn
But your heart stays cool
Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
You can bet
Their love they couldnt deny
Your words say split
But your words they lie
When we kiss
Mmmmmm Fire
Fire
Fire Fire Fire Fire
