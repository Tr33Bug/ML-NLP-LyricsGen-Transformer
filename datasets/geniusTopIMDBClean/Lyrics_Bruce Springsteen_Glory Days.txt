Yeah
Uh
Wooh
Huh
I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was
Glory days well theyll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye
Glory days glory days
Well theres a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boys heads
Sometimes on a Friday Ill stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess its two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking bout
Glory days well theyll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye
Glory days glory days
My old man worked twenty years on the line
And they let him go
Now everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that hes too old
I was nineyears old and he was working
At the Metuchen Ford plant assembly line
Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion Hall
But I can tell whats on his mind
Glory days yeah goin back
Glory days aw he aint never had
Glory days glory days
I think Im going down to the well tonight
Im gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I dont sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah just sitting back trying to recapture
A little of the glory yeah
Well time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister
But boring stories of
Glory days well theyll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girls eye
Glory days glory days
