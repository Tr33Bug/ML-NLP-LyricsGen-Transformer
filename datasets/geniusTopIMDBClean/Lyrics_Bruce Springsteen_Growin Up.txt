Well I stood stonelike at midnight
Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair til it was just right
And commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
And came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd
But when they said Sit down I stood up
Ooh ooh growin up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate
She couldnt sail but she sure could sing
I pushed B52 and bombed them with the blues
With my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school
Never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd
But when they said Come down I threw up
Ooh ooh growin up
Work it back now
I took monthlong vacations in the stratosphere
And you know its really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared
I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth
But I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe
In the engine of an old parked car


I hid in the mother breast of the crowd
But when they said Pull down I pulled up
Ooh ooh growin up
Ooh ooh growin up
