My name is Joe Roberts I work for the state
Im a sergeant out of Perrineville Barracks Number 8
I always done an honest jobas honest as I could
I got a brother named Frankie and Frankie aint no good
Now ever since we was young kids its been the same comedown
I get a call on the shortwave Frankies in trouble downtown
Well if it was any other man Id put him straight away
But when its your brother sometimes you look the other way
Me and Frankie laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when hes straying
Like any brother would
A man turns his back on his family
Well he just aint no good
Well Frankie went in the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment settled down took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping till it was like we were getting robbed
Frankie came home in 68 and me I took this job
Yeah were laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when hes straying
Teach him how to walk that line
A man turns his back on his family
He aint no friend of mine


Well the night was like any other I got a call bout quarter to nine
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid lying on the floor looking bad bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table and it was Frank they said
Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights
Well I mustve done a hundred and ten through Michigan County that night
It was out at the crossroads down round Willow Bank
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank
Well I chased him through them county roads
Till a sign said Canadian border five miles from here
I pulled over on the side of the highway
And watched his taillights disappear
Me and Frankie laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when hes straying
Like any brother would
A man turns his back on his family
Well he just aint no good
