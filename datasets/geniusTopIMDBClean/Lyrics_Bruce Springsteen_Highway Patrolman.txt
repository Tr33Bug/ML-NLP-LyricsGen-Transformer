Highway Patrolman Lyrics
My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville Barracks Number 8
I always done an honest jobâ€”as honest as I could
I got a brother named Frankie, and Frankie ain't no good

Now, ever since we was young kids, it's been the same comedown
I get a call on the shortwave: Frankie's in trouble downtown
Well, if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But when it's your brother, sometimes, you look the other way
Me and Frankie laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying
Like any brother would
A man turns his back on his family
Well, he just ain't no good

Well, Frankie went in the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping till it was like we were getting robbed
Frankie came home in '68, and me, I took this job

Yeah, we're laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying
Teach him how to walk that line
A man turns his back on his family
He ain't no friend of mine
You might also like
Well, the night was like any other, I got a call 'bout quarter to nine
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid lying on the floor, looking bad, bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table, and it was Frank, they said

Well, I went out and I jumped in my car, and I hit the lights
Well, I must've done a hundred and ten through Michigan County that night
It was out at the crossroads, down round Willow Bank
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank

Well, I chased him through them county roads
Till a sign said "Canadian border, five miles from here"
I pulled over on the side of the highway
And watched his taillights disappear

Me and Frankie laughing and drinking
Nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Maria
As the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's straying
Like any brother would
A man turns his back on his family
Well, he just ain't no goodEmbed
