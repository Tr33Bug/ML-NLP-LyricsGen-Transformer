Theres a light on yonder mountain
And its calling me to shine
Theres a girl over by the water fountain
And shes asking to be mine
And Jesus is standing in the doorway
In a buckskin jacket boots and spurs so fine
He says We need you son tonight up in Dodge City
Cause theres just too many outlaws trying to work the same line
Now if Jesus was a sheriff and I were a priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
If Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
Theres still too many bad boys trying to work the same line
Well sweet Virgin Mary runs the Holy Grail saloon
Well for a nickel shell give you whiskey and a personally blessed balloon
And the Holy Ghost is the host with the most he runs the burlesque show
Where theyll let you in for free and they hit you when you go
Mary serving Mass on Sunday and she sells her body on Monday
To the bootlegger who paid the highest price
He dont know he got stuck with a loser shes a stone junkie whats more shes a user
Shes only been made once or twice by some kind of magic
If Jesus was a sheriff and I were a priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
And Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
Theres still too many outlaws trying to work the same line
Well things aint been the same in heaven since Big Bad Bobby came to town
Hes been known to down eleven then ask for another round
Me Ive got scabs on my knees from kneeling way too long
Its about time I played the man took a stand where I belong
And I forget about the old friends and the old times
Theres just too many new boys trying to work the same line
Well if Jesus was a sheriff and I were a priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
And Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
Theres just too many outlaws trying to work the same line
Well theres a light on yonder mountain
And its calling me to shine
Theres a girl over by the water fountain
Shes asking to be mine
Jesus is standing in the doorway
Six gun drawn and ready to fan
Said We need you tonight son up in Dodge City
Told him I was already overdue for Cheyenne
If Jesus was the sheriff and I were a priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
And Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
Theres still too many bad boys trying to work the same line
If Jesus was the sheriff and I were a priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
And Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
Theres still too many bad boys trying to work the same line
If Jesus was the sheriff and I was a priest
