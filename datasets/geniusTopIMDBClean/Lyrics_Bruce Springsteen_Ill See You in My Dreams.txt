The road is long and seeming without end
The days go on I remember you my friend
And though youre gone and my hearts been emptied it seems
Ill see you in my dreams
I got the old guitar here by the bed
All your favorite records and all the books that you read
And though my soul feels like its been split at the seams
Ill see you in my dreams
Ill see you in my dreams when all our summers have come to an end
Ill see you in my dreams well meet and live and laugh again
Ill see you in my dreams yeah around the river bend
For death is not the nd
And Ill see you in my dreams
Ill see you in my dreams when all our summrs have come to an end
Ill see you in my dreams well meet and live and laugh again
Ill see you in my dreams yeah around the river bend
For death is not the end
And Ill see you in my dreams
See you in my dreams
See you in my dreams
Go
And Ill see you in my dreams
