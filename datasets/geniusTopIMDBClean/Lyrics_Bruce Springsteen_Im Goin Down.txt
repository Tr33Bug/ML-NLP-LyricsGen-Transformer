We sit in the car outside your house youre quiet
I can feel the heat coming around
I go to put my arm around you
And you give me a look like Im way out of bounds
Well you let out one of your bored sighs
Well lately when I look into your eyes
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
We get dressed up and we go out baby for the night
We come home early burning burning in some fire fight
Im sick and tired of you setting me up yeah
Setting me up just to knocka knocka knocka me down
Down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
I pull you close now baby
But when we kiss I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you insideout
I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night Id drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild yeah
But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down
Down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
Im goin down down down down
