Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Oh oh oh
Im on fire
Tell me now baby is he good to you
And can he do to you the things that I do
Oh no I can take you higher
Oh oh oh
Im on fire
Sometimes its like someone took a knife baby edgy and dull
And cut a sixinch valley through the middle of my skull
At night I wake up with the sheets soakin wet
And a freight train runnin through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh oh oh
Im on fire
Oh oh oh
Im on fire
Oh oh oh
Im on fire
Oohooh ooh
Oohooh oohooh
Oohoohooh oohooh
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh
Oohoohooh oohooh
