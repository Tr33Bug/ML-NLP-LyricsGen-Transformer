Well Janeys got a doctor who tears apart her insides
He investigates her and silently baits her sighs
He probes with his fingers but knows her heart only through his stethoscope
His hands are cold and his bodys so old
Janey turns him down like dope
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter like me on her side
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
Well Janeys got a priest from his marble pulpit he smiles
He provides consolation and he hears her confession at any time
In the pages of his Bible he holds from what Janey hides
And with her doors open wide she begs Come inside
But hes been frozen so long on the outside
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter like me on her side
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
Well Janeys got a cop who lives around the block
And checks on her every night
And her skin would turn pale as the siren hed wail outside
When he knew I was inside
Janeys small and sometimes he scared her
So I held her real close she was more saint than a ghost
And told her I so long had been prepared for her
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter like me on her side
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter man who knows her style
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter like me on her side
Janey needs a shooter now
A shooter man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
A man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
A man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
A man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
A man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
A man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
A man who knows her style
The way that I know her style
