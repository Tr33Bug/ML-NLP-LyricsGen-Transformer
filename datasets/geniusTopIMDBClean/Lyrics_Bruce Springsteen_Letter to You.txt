Neath a crowd of mongrel trees I pulled that bothersome thread
Got down on my knees grabbed my pen and bowed my head
Tried to summon all that my heart finds true
And send it in my letter to you
Whoa
Things I found out through hard times and good
I wrote em all out in ink and blood
Dug deep in my soul and signed my name true
And sent it in my letter to you
In my letter to you
I took all my fears and doubts
In my letter to you
All the hard things I found out
In my letter to you
All that I found true
And I sent it in my letter to you
I took all the sunshine and rain
All my happiness and all my pain
The dark evning stars and the morning sky of blue
And I sent it in my ltter to you
And I sent it in my letter to you
In my letter to you
I took all my fears and doubts
In my letter to you
All the hard things I found out
In my letter to you
All that I found true
And I sent it in my letter to you
I sent it in my letter to you
