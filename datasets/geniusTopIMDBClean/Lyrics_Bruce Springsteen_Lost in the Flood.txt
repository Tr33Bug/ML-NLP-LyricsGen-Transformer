The ragamuffin gunner is returnin home like a hungry runaway
He walks through town all alone
He must be from the fort he hears the high school girls say
This countrysides burnin with wolfmen fairies dressed in drag for homicide
They hit and run plead sanctuary neath the holy stone they hide
Theyre breakin beams and crosses with a spastics reelin perfection
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant pleadin immaculate conception
And everybodys wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood
Sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep his ankles caked in mud
And I said Hey gunner man thats quicksand
Thats quicksand that aint mud
Have you thrown your senses to the war
Or did you lose them in the flood
That pure American brother dulleyed and emptyfaced
Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight
He rides her low on the hip on the side hes got Bound For Glory in red white and blue flash paint
He leans on the hood telling racin stories the kids call him Jimmy The Saint
Well that blaze and noise boy hes gunnin that bitch loaded to blastin point
He rides headfirst into a hurricane and disappears into a point
And theres nothin left but some blood where the body fell
That is nothin left that you could sell
Just junk all across the horizon a real highwaymans farewell
And I said Hey kid you think thats oil
Man that aint oil thats blood
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm
Or was he just lost in the flood
Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
Some storefront incarnation of Maria shes puttin on me the stare
And Bronxs best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware
Everything stops you hear five quick shots the cops come up for air
And now the whizbang gang from uptown theyre shootin up the street
Whoa that cat from the Bronx starts lettin loose but he gets blown right off his feet
Oh and some kid comes blastin round the corner but a cop puts him right away
He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish
Still breathing when I walked away


And somebody said Hey man did you see that
His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud
I wonder what the dude was sayin
Or was he just lost in the flood
Well hey man did you see that
Lord those poor cats are sure messed up
I wonder what they were gettin into
Or were they all just lost in the flood
Were they lost oh tell me tell me man
Were they lost
