I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
Id sit on his lap in that big old Buick
And steer as we drove through town
Hed tousle my hair and say Son take a good look around
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
In 65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights tween the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night
In the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come to my hometown
To my hometown
To my hometown
To my hometown
Now Main Streets whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there aint nobody wants to come down here no more
Theyre closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says These jobs are going boys
And they aint coming back
To your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown


Last night me and Kate we laid in bed
Talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
Im thirtyfive we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said
Son take a good look around
This is your hometown
