I saw her standing on her front lawn just twirling her baton
Me and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people died
From the town of Lincoln Nebraska with a sawedoff 410 on my lap
Through to the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path
I cant say that Im sorry for the things that we done
At least for a little while sir me and her we had us some fun
Now the jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to death
Midnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chest
Sheriff when the man pulls that switch sir and snaps my poor head back
You make sure my pretty baby is sittin right there on my lap
They declared me unfit to live said into that great void my sould be hurled
They wanted to know why I did what I did
Well sir I guess theres just a meanness in this world
