Well we busted out of class
Had to get away from those fools
We learned more from a threeminute record baby
Than we ever learned in school
Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound
I can feel my heart begin to pound
You say youre tired and you just want to close your eyes
And follow your dreams down
Well we made a promise we swore wed always remember
No retreat baby no surrender
Like soldiers in the winters night with a vow to defend
No retreat baby no surrender
Well now young faces grow sad and old
And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
Im ready to grow young again
And hear your sisters voice calling us home
Across the open yards
Well maybe well cut someplace of our own
With these drums and these guitars
Well we made a promise we swore wed always remember
No retreat baby no surrender
Like soldiers in the winters night with a vow to defend
No retreat baby no surrender
Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim
The walls of my room are closing in
Theres a war outside still raging
You say it aint ours anymore to win
I want to sleep beneath
Peaceful skies in my lovers bed
With a wide open country in my eyes
And these romantic dreams in my head
Well we made a promise we swore wed always remember
No retreat baby no surrender
Like soldiers in the winters night with a vow to defend
No retreat baby no surrender
