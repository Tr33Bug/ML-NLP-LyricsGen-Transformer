I got a sixtynine Chevy with a threeninersix
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
Shes waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the SevenEleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut em up and then we shut em down
Tonight tonight the strips just right
I wanna blow em off in my first heat
Summers here and the time is right
For racin in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Now some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
Then go racin in the street
Tonight tonight the strips just right
I wanna blow em all out of their seats
Were calling out around the world
Were going racin in the street
I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from LA
I blew that Camaro off my back and drove that little girl away
But now theres wrinkles around my babys eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs Baby did you make it all right
She sits on the porch of her daddys house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shutdown strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me were gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight tonight the highways bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
Cause summers here and the time is right
For racin in the street
