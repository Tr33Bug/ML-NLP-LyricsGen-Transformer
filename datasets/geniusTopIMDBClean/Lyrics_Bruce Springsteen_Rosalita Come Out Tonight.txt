Rosalita  Come Out Tonight  Lyrics
Spread out now Rosie doctor come cut loose her mamas reins
You know playin blind mans bluff is a little babys game
You pick up Little Dynamite Im gonna pick up Little Gun
And together were gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You dont have to call me lieutenant Rosie and I dont want to be your son
The only lover Im ever gonna needs your soft sweet little girls tongue
Ah Rosie youre the one
Dynamites in the belfry baby playin with the bats
Little Guns downtown in front of Woolworths tryin out his attitude on all the cats
Papas on the corner waitin for the bus
Mama shes home in the window waitin up for us
Shell be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs cause you know we aint gonna come
Ah I aint here on business baby Im only here for fun
And Rosie youre the one
Rosalita jump a little lighter
Seorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover aint no liar
Rosalita youre my stone desire
Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knees Willie dont you know theyre gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bones Billy theyll be comin up for air
Were gonna play some pool skip some school act real cool
Stay out all night its gonna feel all right
So Rosie come out tonight oh baby come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters chimneys for the poor
Oh closets are for hangers winners use the door
So use it Rosie thats what its there for
Rosalita jump a little lighter
Seorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover aint no liar
Rosalita youre my stone desire
All right
Now I know your mama she dont like me cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy he dont dig me but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom he locked you in your room
Im coming to lend a hand
Im coming to liberate you confiscate you I want to be your man
Someday well look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now youre sad your mamas mad
And your papa says he knows that I dont  have any money 
Whoa your papa says he knows  that I dont have any money 
Whoa so your daddy says he knows I dont have  Papa says he knows that I dont have any money 
Well tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company Rosie just gave me a big advance


And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed but the Lord had mercy
And my machine shes a dud Im stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well hold on tight stay up all night cause Rosie Im comin on strong
By the time we meet the morning light I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
Theres a little caf where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear em in the back room strummin
So hold tight baby cause dont you know daddys comin
Oh everybody so
Rosalita jump a little lighter
Seorita come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover aint no liar
Rosalita youre my stone desire
Oh yeah
