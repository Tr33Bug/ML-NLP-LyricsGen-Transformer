Shell let you in her house
If you come knocking late at night
Shell let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
Shell let you deep inside
But theres a secret garden she hides
Shell let you in her car
To go driving around
Shell let you into the parts of herself
That will bring you down
Shell let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden dont think twice
Youve gone a million miles
How far would you get
To that place where you cant remember
And you cant forget
Shell lead you down a path
There will be tenderness in the air
Shell let you come just far enough
So you know shes really there
Then shell look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
Shes got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away
