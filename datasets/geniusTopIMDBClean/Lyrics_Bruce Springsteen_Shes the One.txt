With her killer graces
And her secret places
That no boy can fill
With her hands on her hips
Oh and that smile on her lips
Because she knows that it kills me
With her soft French cream
Standing in that doorway like a dream
I wish shed just leave me alone
Because French cream wont soften them boots
And French kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling
And her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
Oh shes the one
Shes the one
That thunder in your heart
At night when youre kneeling in the dark
It says youre never gonna leave her
But theres this angel in her eyes
That tells such desperate lies
And all you want to do is believe her
And tonight youll try
Just one more time
To leave it all behind
And to break on through
Oh she can take you
But if she wanna break you
Shes gonna find out that aint so easy to do
And no matter where you sleep
Tonight or how far you run
Oh shes the one
Shes the one
Oh and just one kiss
Shed fill them long summer nights
With her tenderness
That secret pact you made
Back when her love could save you
From the bitterness
Oh shes the one
Oh shes the one
Oh shes the one
Oh shes the one
