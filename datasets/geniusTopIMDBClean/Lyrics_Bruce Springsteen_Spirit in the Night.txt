Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin hands
long came Wild Billy with his friend Gman all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
Its about a mile down on the dark side of route eightyeight
I got a bottle of rose so lets try it
Well pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and Ill take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
Theyre built like light
And they dance like spirits in the night  All night  in the night  All night 
Oh you dont know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night  All night  in the night  All night 
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you
Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said Try some of this itll show you where youre at or at least itll help you really feel it
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janeys fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said Im hurt she said Honey let me heal it
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice just as soft as a spirit in the night  All night 
In the night  All night  oh Janey dont know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night  All night  all night  All night 
Stand right up and let her shoot through me
Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin love in the dirt singin our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night  All night  in the night  All night 
Baby dont know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night  All night  all night  All night 
Oh stand right up and let it shoot through you
Like a spirit in the night  All night  all night  All night 
All night  All night  all night  All night 
All night  All night  all night  All night 
All night all night
All night
