State Trooper Lyrics
New Jersey turnpike, ridin' on a wet night
'Neath the refinery's glow, out where the great black rivers flow
License, registration, I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience 'bout the things that I done

Mister State Trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me

Maybe you got a kid, maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I got's been botherin' me my whole life
Mister State Trooper, please don't stop me
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me

In the wee, wee hours, your mind gets hazy
Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby
Radio's jammed up with talk show stations
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk till you lose your patience

Mister State Trooper, please don't stop me

Hey, somebody out there, listen to my last prayer
Hi ho silver-o, deliver me from nowhere
Hi hoYou might also like1Embed
