New Jersey turnpike ridin on a wet night
Neath the refinerys glow out where the great black rivers flow
License registration I aint got none
But I got a clear conscience bout the things that I done
Mister State Trooper please dont stop me
Please dont stop me please dont stop me
Maybe you got a kid maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I gots been botherin me my whole life
Mister State Trooper please dont stop me
Please dont stop me please dont stop me
In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy
Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby
Radios jammed up with talk show stations
Its just talk talk talk talk till you lose your patience
Mister State Trooper please dont stop me
Hey somebody out there listen to my last prayer
Hi ho silvero deliver me from nowhere
Hi ho
