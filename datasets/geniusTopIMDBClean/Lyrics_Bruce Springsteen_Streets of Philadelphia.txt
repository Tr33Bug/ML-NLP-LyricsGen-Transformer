I was bruised and battered I couldnt tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window I didnt know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin away
On the Streets of Philadelphia
I walked the avenue til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
It was just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia
Aint no angel gonna greet me
Its just you and I my friend
My clothes dont fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin
The night has fallen Im lyin awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the Streets of Philadelphia
