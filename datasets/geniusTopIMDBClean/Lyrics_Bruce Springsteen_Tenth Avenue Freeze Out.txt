Tear drops on the city
Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty
And you cant find the room to move
Well everybody better move over thats all
Cause Im running on the bad side
And I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freezeout Tenth Avenue freezeout
I was stranded in the jungle
Tryin to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalks bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freezeout
Tenth Avenue freezeout
And Im all alone Im all alone
And kid you better get the picture
And Im on my own Im on my own
And I cant go home
When the change was made uptown
And the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city
All the little pretties raise their hands
Im gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
With a Tenth Avenue freezeout tenth avenue freezeout
Tenth avenue freezeout
