Men walking along the railroad tracks
Going someplace theres no going back
Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
Shelter line stretching around the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
No home no job no peace no rest
Well the highway is alive tonight
But nobodys kidding nobody about where it goes
Im sitting down here in the campfire light
Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad
He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box beneath the underpass
You got a oneway ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the citys aqueduct
Well the highway is alive tonight
Where its headed everybody knows
Im sitting down here in the campfire light
Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad
Now Tom said Mom wherever theres a cop beating a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Where theres a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me Mom Ill be there


Wherever somebodys fighting for a place to stand
Or a decent job or a helping hand
Wherever somebodys struggling to be free
Look in their eyes Ma and youll see me
Well the highway is alive tonight
But nobodys kidding nobody about where it goes
Im sitting down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad
