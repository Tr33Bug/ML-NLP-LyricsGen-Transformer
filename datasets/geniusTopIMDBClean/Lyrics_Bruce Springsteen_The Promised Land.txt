On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert
I pick up my money and head back into town
Driving cross the Waynesboro county line
I got the radio on and Im just killing time
Working all day in my daddys garage
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Pretty soon little girl Im gonna take charge
The dogs on Main Street howl cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I aint a boy no Im a man
And I believe in a promised land
Ive done my best to live the right way
I get up every morning and go to work each day
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode
Explode and tear this whole town apart
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart
Find somebody itching for something to start
The dogs on Main Street howl cause they understand
If I could reach one moment into my hands
Mister I aint a boy no Im a man
And I believe in a promised land
Well theres a dark cloud rising from the desert floor
I packed my bags and Im heading straight into the storm
Gonna be a twister to blow everything down
That aint got the faith to stand its ground
Blow away the dreams that tear you apart
Blow away the dreams that break your heart
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted


The dogs on Main Street howl cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I aint a boy no Im a man
And I believe in a promised land
