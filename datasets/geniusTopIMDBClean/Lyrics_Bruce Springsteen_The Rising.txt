Cant see nothing in front of me
Cant see nothing coming up behind
Make my way through this darkness
I cant feel nothing but this chain that binds me
Lost track of how far Ive gone
How far Ive gone how high Ive climbed
On my backs a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a halfmile line
Come on up for the rising
Come on up lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight
Left the house this morning
Bells were ringing and filled the air
I was wearing the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rolling down here
Come on up for the rising
Come on up lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight
Theres spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black eyes burning bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord as I stand before your fiery light
I see you Mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
Theres holy pictures of our children
Dancing in a sky filled with light
May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mix with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancing on the end of the line
Sky of blackness and sorrow  A dream of life 
Sky of love sky of tears  A dream of life 
Sky of glory and sadness  A dream of life 
Sky of mercy sky of fear  A dream of life 
Sky of memory and shadow  A dream of life 
Your burning wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness  A dream of life 
Sky of fullness sky of blessed life  A dream of life 
Come on up for the rising
Come on up lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight
