Dirty old street all slushed up in the rain and snow
Little boy and his ma shivering outside a rundown music store window
That night on top of a Christmas tree shines one beautiful star
And lying underneath a brandnew Japanese guitar
I remember in the morning Ma hearing your alarm clock ring
Id lie in bed and listen to you gettin ready for work
The sound of your makeup case on the sink
And the ladies at the office all lipstick perfume and rustlin skirts
And how proud and happy you always looked walking home from work
If Pas eyes were windows into a world so deadly and true
You couldnt stop me from looking but you kept me from crawlin through
And if its a funny old world Ma where a little boys wishes come true
Well I got a few in my pocket and a special one just for you
It aint no phone call on Sunday flowers or a Mothers Day card
It aint no house on a hill with a garden and a nice little yard
I got my hot rod down on Bond Street Im older but youll know me in a glance
Well find us a little rock n roll bar and baby well go out and dance
Well it was me in my Beatle boots you in pink curlers and matador pants
Pullin me up off the couch to do The Twist for my uncles and aunts
Well I found a girl of my own now Ma I popped the question on your birthday
She stood waiting on the front porch while you were telling me to get out there
And say what it was that I had to say
Last night we all sat around laughing at the things that guitar bought us
And I layed awake thinking about the other things its brought us
Well tonight Im taking requests here in the kitchen
This ones for you Ma let me come right out and say it
Its overdue but baby if youre looking for a sad song well I aint gonna play it
