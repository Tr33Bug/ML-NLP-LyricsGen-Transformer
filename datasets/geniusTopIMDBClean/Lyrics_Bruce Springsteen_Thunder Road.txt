The screen door slams Marys dress sways
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey thats me and I want you only
Dont turn me home again
I just cant face myself alone again
Dont run back inside
Darling you know just what Im here for
So youre scared and youre thinking
That maybe we aint that young anymore
Show a little faith theres magic in the night
You aint a beauty but hey youre alright
Oh and thats alright with me
You can hide neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a saviour to rise from these streets
Well now Im no hero thats understood
All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well the nights busting open
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back heavens waiting down on the tracks
Ohoh come take my hand
Were riding out tonight to case the promised land
Ohoh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey I know its late we can make it if we run
Oh Thunder Road sit tight take hold
Thunder Road


Well I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my cars out back if youre ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The doors open but the ride it aint free
And I know youre lonely for words that I aint spoken
But tonight well be free all the promisesll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines roaring on
But when you get to the porch theyre gone on the wind
So Mary climb in
Its a town full of losers
And Im pulling out of here to win
