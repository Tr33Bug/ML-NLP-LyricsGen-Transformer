Well its Saturday night
Youre all dressed up in blue
I been watching you awhile
Maybe you been watching me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebodys heart in a mess
Well if youre looking for love
Honey Im tougher than the rest
Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some goodlookin Joe on their arm
Some girls like a sweettalkin Romeo
Well round here baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if youre rough enough for love
Honey Im tougher than the rest
The road is dark and its a thin thin line
But I want you to know Ill walk it for you any time
Maybe your other boyfriends couldnt pass the test
Well if youre rough and ready for love
Honey Im tougher than the rest
Well it aint no secret
Ive been around a time or two
Well I dont know baby
Maybe youve been around too
Well theres another dance
All you gotta do is say yes
And if youre rough and ready for love
Honey Im tougher than the rest
If youre rough enough for love
Baby Im tougher than the rest
