Fat man sitting on a little stool takes the money from my hand
While his eyes take a walk all over you
Hands me the ticket smiles and whispers good luck with her
Cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove
Well ride down baby into this tunnel of love
I can feel the soft silk of your blouse
And them soft thrills in our little fun house
Then the lights go out and its just the three of us
You me and all that stuff were so scared of
Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love
Theres a crazy mirror showing us both in 5D
Im laughing at you youre laughing at me
Theres a room of shadows that gets so dark brother
Its easy for two people to lose each other
In this tunnel of love
It ought to be easy ought to be simple enough
Man meets a woman and they fall in love
But this house is haunted and the ride gets rough
Youve got to learn to live with what you cant rise above
If you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love
Tunnel of love
Tunnel of love
Tunnel of love
