Its raining but there aint a cloud in the sky
Must have been a tear from your eye
Everything will be okay
Yeah funny I thought I felt a sweet summer breeze
Must have been you sighing so deep
Dont worry were going to find a way
Im waiting waiting on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
Yeah Im waiting on a sunny day
Without you Im working with the rain falling down
Im half a party in a one dog town
I need you to chase these blues away
Without you Im a drummer girl that cant keep a beat
Ice cream truck on a deserted street
I hope that youre comin to stay
Im waiting waiting on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
Waiting on a sunny day
Hard times baby well they come to us all
Sure as the ticking of the clock on the wall
Sure as the turning of the night into day
Your smile girl brings the morning light to my eyes
Lifts away the blues when I rise
I hope that youre coming to stay
Cause Im waiting waiting on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
Waiting on a sunny day
