When you need me call my name
Cause without you my life just wouldnt be the same
If you want me come sunny skies or rain
When you need me just call my name
If you miss me Ill be there
To brush the sunlight from your hair
Ill be there to guide you when trouble walks beside you
If you need me Ill be there
And when this dirty world has been cold to you
I got two strong arms waitin to hold you
And when those mean days come along
Well stand together and well take em on
So if you need me just call my name
When you need me call my name
Cause without you my life just isnt the same
Cause when this world kicked me around
Baby you picked me up off the ground
So if you need me Ill be there
