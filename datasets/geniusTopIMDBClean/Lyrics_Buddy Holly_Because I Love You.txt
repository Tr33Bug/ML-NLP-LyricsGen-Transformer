Well they say what you dont know wont hurt you
And I believe that its so
So dont tell me that you found someone new
To go thru life with you
Because I love you my darling my dearest I love you
Youre the one I want nearest may I love you
And I will bet you love me too
Oh Id rather die thinking you love me
Than to go on thru life without you
And you with someone new
To go thru life with you
Well because I love you I love you my darling
My dearest I love you I love you
Youre the one I want nearest may I love you I love you
And I will bet you love me too
Oh Id rather die thinking you love me
Than to go on thru life without you
And you with someone new
To go thru life with you
