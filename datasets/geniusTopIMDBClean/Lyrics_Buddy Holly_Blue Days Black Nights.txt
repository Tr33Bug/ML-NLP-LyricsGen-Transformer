Blue days black nights blue tears keep on falling
For you dear now youre gone
Blue days black nights my heart keeps on calling
For you dear and you alone
Memories of you make me sorry
I gave you reason to doubt me
But now youre gone and I am left here all alone
With blue memories I think of you
Blue days black nights I didnt realize
I would miss you the way I do
And now somehow I know I will pay
For the times I have made you blue
Memories of you make me sorry
I gave you reason to doubt me
But now youre gone and I am left here all alone
With blue memories I think of you
