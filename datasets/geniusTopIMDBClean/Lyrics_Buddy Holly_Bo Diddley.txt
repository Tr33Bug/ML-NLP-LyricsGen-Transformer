Bo Diddley will buy baby a diamond ring
If that diamond ring dont shine
Hes going to take it to a private eye
If that private eye cant see
He better not takea ringa from me
Wont you come to my house aback at home
Takea my baby on the way from home
Lovea that boodoo oh where have you been
Up to your house and gone again
Bo Diddley caught a fat cat
To make a pretty baby a Sunday hat
Bo Diddley caught a nannygoat
To make a pretty baby a Sunday coat
Bo Diddley Bo Diddley have you heard
My pretty baby said she was a bird
