Oh arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judges wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free
That brown eyed man
Flying across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walking across the sand
Shed been awalking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
Way back in history three thousand years
In fact ever since the world began
Theres been a whole lot of good women shedding tears
Over a brown eyed handsome man
A lot of trouble with a brown eyed handsome man
Well a beautiful a daughter couldnt make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her Darling go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
Thats what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
Well the Milo de Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
Wella two three the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stands
Arounding third he was aheading for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game it was a brown eyed handsome man
