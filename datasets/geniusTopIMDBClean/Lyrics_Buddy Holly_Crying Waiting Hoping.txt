Crying waiting hoping youll come back
I just cant seem to get you off my mind
Crying waiting hoping youll come back
Youre the one I love
And I think about you all the time
Crying my tears keep afalling all night long
Waiting it feels so useless I know its wrong
To keep acrying waiting hoping youll come back
Maybe someday soon
Things will change and youll be mine
Crying my tears keep afalling all night long
Waiting it feels so useless I know its wrong
To keep acrying waiting hoping youll come back
Maybe someday soon
Things will change and youll be mine
