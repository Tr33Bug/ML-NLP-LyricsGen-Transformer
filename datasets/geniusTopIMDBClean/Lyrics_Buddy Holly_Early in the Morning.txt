Well you gonna miss me
Early in the morning
One of these days oh yeah
Well you gonna want me
Early in the morning
When Im away
Hey hey dont you know
Yes youll be sorry for the times I cried
Youll be sorry for the time you lied
Well you gonna miss me
Early in the morning
For one of these days oh yeah
Well you know a rollin stone
Dont gather no moss
And you cross your bridge
When its time to cross
Well you broke my heart
When you said goodbye
And now the milk is spilt
But you gonna cry
Yeah early in the morning
You gonna know that I was right
Oh yeah yeah
Early in the morning
When theres nobody to hold you tight
Oh oh oh
Well you gonna want me
And want me back
You gonna miss the best man you ever had
Yes you gonna miss me
You gonna want me
One of this days oh yeah
Well you gonna want me
I want you back
Miss the best man you ever had
Yes you gonna want me
And you gonna miss me
For one of this days
Yeah yeah yeah
