Every day its agetting closer
Going faster than a rollercoaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Ahey aheyhey
Every day its agetting faster
Everyone said Go ahead and ask her
Love like yours will surely come my way
Ahey aheyhey
Every day seems a little longer
Every way loves a little stronger
Come what may
Do you ever long for true love from me
Every day its agetting closer
Going faster than a rollercoaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Ahey aheyhey
Every day seems a little longer
Every way loves a little stronger
Come what may
Do you ever long for true love from me
Every day its agetting closer
Going faster than a rollercoaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
Ahey aheyhey
Love like yours will surely come my way
