Do you think of me darling
While were many miles apart
Oh please be true to me my darling
For you are the flower of my heart
Many nights Ive sat alone
And Ive worried over you
But Ill never worry dear
If your love is true
Please come back to me my darling
For I cant live while were apart
Come back come back to me my darling
For you are the flower of my heart
Many nights Ive sat alone
And Ive worried over you
But Ill never worry dear
If your love is true
Please come back to me my darling
For I cant live while were apart
Come back come back to me my darling
For you are the flower of my heart
