You took me up to heaven
When you took me in your arms
I was dazzled by your kisses
Blinded by your charms
I was lost  I was lost  in a Fools Paradise  Fools Paradise 
Good and lost  Good and lost  in a Fools Paradise
When you told me that you loved me
I gave my heart to you
And I wondered if there could be
Any truth in love so new
I was lost  I was lost  in a Fools Paradise  Fools Paradise 
Good and lost  Good and lost  in a Fools Paradise
The whole world was my kingdom
And your love the gem in my crown
Then I saw you glance at a new romance
And my love came tumbling down
Though you treat me kinda coldish
And may never let me know
That you think Im being foolish
Because I love you so
Ill still get lost  I still get lost  in a Fools Paradise  Fools Paradise 
Lost with you  Lost with you  in a Fools Paradise
Though you treat me kinda coldish
And may never let me know
That you think Im being foolish
Because I love you so


Ill still get lost  I still get lost  in a Fools Paradise  Fools Paradise 
Lost with you  Lost with you  in a Fools Paradise
Lost with you  Lost with you  in a Fools Paradise
