Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
Heartbeat
Why does a love kiss stay in my memory
Piddle dee pat
I know that new love thrills me
I know that true love will be
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
Heartbeat
Why do you skip when my babys lips meet mine
Heartbeat
Why do you flip then give me a skip beat sign
Piddle dee pat
And sing to me love stories
And bring to me loves glories
