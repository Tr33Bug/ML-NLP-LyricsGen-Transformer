III should have reconsidered all those things I said Id do
So now Im changing all those changes
That I made when I left you
Sweetheart Im changing all those changes
That I made when I left you
Because I made those changes when I thought you were untrue
Abut now youre gone Ive found Im wrong
And theres anothing I can do
Except to change up all those changes
That I made when I left you
III didnt stop to think I just left without a care
And now I know Im wrong and I cant find you anywhere
I should have reconsidered all those things I said Id do
So now Im changing all those changes
That I made when I left you
