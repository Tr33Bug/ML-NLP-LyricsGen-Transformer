Iâ€™m Changing All Those Changes Lyrics
I-I-I should have reconsidered all those things I said I'd do
So now I'm changing all those changes
That I made when I left you

Sweetheart I'm changing all those changes
That I made when I left you
Because I made those changes when I thought you were untrue
A-but now you're gone I've found I'm wrong
And there's a-nothing I can do
Except to change up all those changes
That I made when I left you
I-I-I didn't stop to think, I just left without a care
And now I know I'm wrong and I can't find you anywhere
I should have reconsidered all those things I said I'd do
So now I'm changing all those changes
That I made when I left youYou might also likeEmbed
