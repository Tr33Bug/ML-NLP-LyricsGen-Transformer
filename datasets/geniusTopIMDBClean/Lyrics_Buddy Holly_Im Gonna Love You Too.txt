Youre going to say youll miss me
Youre going to say youll kiss me
Yes youre going to say youll love me
Because Im going to love you too
I dont care what you told me
Youre going to say youll hold me
Yes youre going to say youll love me
Because Im going to love you too
After all another fellow took you
But I still cant overlook you
Im going to do my best to hook you
After all is said and done
Its going to happen someday
Youre going to see things my way
Yes youre going to say youll love me
Because Im going to love you too
Youre going to tell me sweet things
Youre going to make my heart sing
Yes youre going to hear those bells ring
Because Im going to love you too
Im going to love you too
