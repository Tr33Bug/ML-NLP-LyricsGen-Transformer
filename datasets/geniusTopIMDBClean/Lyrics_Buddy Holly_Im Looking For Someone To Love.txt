Iâ€™m Looking For Someone To Love Lyrics
Staying at home, waiting for you
Just won't get it 'cause you say we're thru

Well I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby, I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love
Playing the field all day long
Since I found out I was wronged

Well I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby, I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love

Caught myself, thinking of you
You can't love me and another one too

Well I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love

Drunk man, street car
Foot slipped, there you are
You might also like
Well I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
Well if you're not here
But baby, I don't care
Because I'm looking for someone to love

I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to love
I'm looking for someone to loveEmbed
