Staying at home waiting for you
Just wont get it cause you say were thru
Well Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
Well if youre not here
But baby I dont care
Because Im looking for someone to love
Playing the field all day long
Since I found out I was wronged
Well Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
Well if youre not here
But baby I dont care
Because Im looking for someone to love
Caught myself thinking of you
You cant love me and another one too
Well Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
Well if youre not here
But baby I dont care
Because Im looking for someone to love
Drunk man street car
Foot slipped there you are


Well Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
Well if youre not here
But baby I dont care
Because Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
Im looking for someone to love
