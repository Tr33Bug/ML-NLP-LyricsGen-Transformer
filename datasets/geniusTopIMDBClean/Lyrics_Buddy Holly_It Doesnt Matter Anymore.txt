There you go and baby here am I
Well you left me here so I could sit and cry
Well Golly gee what have you done to me
Well I guess it doesnt matter anymore
Do you remember baby last September
How you held me tight each and every night
Well oopsie daisy how you drove me crazy
But I guess it doesnt matter anymore
Theres no use in me acrying
Ive done everything
And now Im sick of trying
Ive thrown away my nights
And wasted all my days over you
Well you go your way and Ill go mine
Now and forever till the end of time
Ill find somebody new and baby
Well say were through
And you wont matter anymore
Theres no use in me acrying
Ive done everything
And now Im sick of trying
Ive thrown away my nights
And wasted all my days over you
Well you go your way and Ill go mine
Now and forever till the end of time
And Ill find somebody new and baby
Well say were through
And you wont matter anymore
