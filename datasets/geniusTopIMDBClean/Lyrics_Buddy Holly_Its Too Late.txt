Its too late  shes gone
Its too late  my babys gone
Wish I had told her  she was my only one
But its too late  shes gone
Its a weak man that cries
So I guess Id best dry my eyes
Guess I will miss her more than anyone
But its too late  shes gone
Shes gone  yes shes gone
Shes gone  my my babys gone
Shes gone  yes shes gone
Where can my baby be
I wonder does she know
When she left me  it hurt me so
I need your loving  please dont make me weep
And tell me  its not too late
I need your loving  please dont make me weep
And tell me  its not too late  not too late
