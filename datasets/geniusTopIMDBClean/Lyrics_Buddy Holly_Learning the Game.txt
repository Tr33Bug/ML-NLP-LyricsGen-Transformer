Hearts that are broken and love thats untrue
These go with learning the game
When you love her and she doesnt love you
Youre only learning the game
When she says that youre the only one shell ever love
Then you find that you are not the one shes thinking of
Feeling so sad and youre all alone and blue
Thats when youre learning the game
Thats when youre learning the game
