Hey hey look at me and tell me
Whats going to happen to you
When youve broken too many peoples hearts
And cant find anyone new
Say say look at me and tell me
About that twinkle in your eye
Is the twinkle in your eye meant for me
Or meant for some other guy
Look at me from now on
Know the love we share
Look at me from now on
Let me know you care
Hey hey look at me and tell me
Whats going to happen to you
When youve spoken sweet words of love to me
And I want to marry you
