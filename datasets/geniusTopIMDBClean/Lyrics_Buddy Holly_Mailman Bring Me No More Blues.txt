Mailman bring me no more blues
Mailman bring me no more blues
One little letter is all I can use
She wrote me only one sad line
Told me shes no longer mine
Mr Mailman thatll do for some time
Cry like never before
So hard couldnt cry no more
Shooshoo mailman stay away from my door
Mailman bring me no more blues
Mailman bring me no more blues
One little letter is all I can use
