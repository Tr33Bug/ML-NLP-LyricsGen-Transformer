Well if you see old Annie better give her a lift
Because Annies been aworking on the midnight shift
If Annie puts her hair up on her head
Paints them lips up bright bright red
Wears that dress that fits real tight
Starts staying out late till the middle of the night
Says to her friend give her a lift
Well Annies been aworking on the midnight shift
If she acts a little funny seems a little strange
Starts spending your money for brand new things
Tells you that she wants to use the car
Never explains what she wants it for
Brother there just aint no ifs
Because Annies been aworking on the midnight shift
Well early in the morning when the sun comes up
You look at old Annie and she looks kind a rough
You tell her honey get out of that bed
She says leave me alone Im just about dead
If you got a good mama thats staying at home
You better enjoy cause it wont last long
When you think everythings all right
She starts slipping round in the middle of the night
