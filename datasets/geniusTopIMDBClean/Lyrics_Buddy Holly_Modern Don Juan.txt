Modern Don Juan Lyrics
Well, I am not nothing but a man in love
I am not nothing but a man in love
The girls they say, I'm their only one
They say I'm a modern Don Juan
Well there am not but one thing puzzling me
I got a girl and she can't see
That I want only to make her mine
Well she thinks I'm just handing her a line

Oh, I love her so, I'll never ever let her go-o-hoh
I am not nothing but a man in love
The girls they say, I'm their only one
They say I'm a modern Don Juan

Well, I am not nothing but a man in love
I am not nothing but a man in loveYou might also likeEmbed
