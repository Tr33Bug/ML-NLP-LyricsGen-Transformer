Well I am not nothing but a man in love
I am not nothing but a man in love
The girls they say Im their only one
They say Im a modern Don Juan
Well there am not but one thing puzzling me
I got a girl and she cant see
That I want only to make her mine
Well she thinks Im just handing her a line
Oh I love her so Ill never ever let her goohoh
I am not nothing but a man in love
The girls they say Im their only one
They say Im a modern Don Juan
Well I am not nothing but a man in love
I am not nothing but a man in love
