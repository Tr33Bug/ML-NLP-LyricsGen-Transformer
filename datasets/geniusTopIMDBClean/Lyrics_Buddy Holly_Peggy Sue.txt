If you knew Peggy Sue
Then youd know why I feel blue
Without Peggy my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you gal yes I love you Peggy Sue
Peggy Sue Peggy Sue
Oh how my heart yearns for you
Oh Peggy my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you gal yes I love you Peggy Sue
Peggy Sue Peggy Sue
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you gal and I need you Peggy Sue
I love you Peggy Sue with a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy my Peggy Sue
Well I love you gal I want you Peggy Sue
Peggy Sue Peggy Sue
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you gal yes I need you Peggy Sue
I love you Peggy Sue with a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you gal and I want you Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you gal and I want you Peggy Sue
