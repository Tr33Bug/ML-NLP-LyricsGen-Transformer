The sun is out
The sky is blue
Theres not a cloud
To spoil the view
But its raining
Raining In My Heart
The Weather Man
Says Clear today
He doesnt know
Youve gone away
And its raining
Raining In My Heart
Oh misery  misery
Whats gonna become of me
I tell my blues
They mustnt show
But soon these tears
Are bound to flow
Cause its raining
Raining In My Heart
Raining In My Heart
Raining In My Heart
