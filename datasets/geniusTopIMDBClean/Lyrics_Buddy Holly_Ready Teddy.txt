Ready  set  go man go
I got a gal that I love so
Im ready  ready ready Teddy
Im ready ready ready to rock and roll
Going down to the corner pick up my sweetie pie
Shes my rock and roll baby shes the apple of my eye
Well the flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping the cats are going wild
The music really sends me I dig that crazy style
Going to kick off my shoes roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock and roll baby pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left I shuffle to the right
Going to rock and roll until the early early night
