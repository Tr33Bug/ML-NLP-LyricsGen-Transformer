Im just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who youve been kissing
Baby ohoh baby
Ive been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You dont love me any more
Ill get over youaoo baby
Although my hearts still sore
Well you know my hearts still sore
Well you know my hearts still sore
When I think of all the lies you told
To that young man my heart youve sold
Youre a cheater and a mean mistreated
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
Im lonely for your love
And the longest day I live
Its only you that Ill be thinking of
You know Im thinking of
Well its you Im thinking of
Mmmmmm mmmmmm
