Slipping and asliding peeping and ahiding
Been told a long time ago
Slipping and asliding peeping and ahiding
Been told a long time ago
Ive been told baby youve been bold
I wont be your fool no more
Oh big conniver nothing but a jive
I done got hip to your jive
Oh big conniver nothing but a jive
Done got hip to your jive
Slipping and asliding peeping and ahiding
And I wont abe your fool no more
Oh my Linda shes a solid sender
You know you better surrender
Oh my Linda shes a solid sender
You know you better surrender
Slipping and sliding peeping and hiding
And I wont be your fool no more
Slipping and asliding peeping and ahiding
Been told a long time ago
Slipping and asliding peeping and ahiding
Been told a long time ago
Ive been told baby youve been bold
I wont be your fool no more
