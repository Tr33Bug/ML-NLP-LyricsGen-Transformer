Well thatll be the day when you say goodbye
Yes thatll be the day when you make me cry
You say youre going to leave you know its a lie
Cause thatll be the day when I die
Well you give me all your lovin and your turtle dovin
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well you know you love me baby
Still you tell me maybe
That someday well Ill be through
Well thatll be the day when you say goodbye
Yes thatll be the day when you make me cry
You say youre going to leave you know its a lie
Cause thatll be the day when I die
Well thatll be the day when you say goodbye
Yes thatll be the day when you make me cry
You say youre going to leave you know its a lie
Cause thatll be the day when I die
Well when Cupid shot his dart
He shot it at your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You sit and hold me and you tell me boldly
That someday well Ill be blue
Well thatll be the day when you say goodbye
Yes thatll be the day when you make me cry
You say youre going to leave you know its a lie
Cause thatll be the day when I die
Well thatll be the day hoohoo
Thatll be the day hoohoo
Thatll be the day hoohoo
Thatll be the day
