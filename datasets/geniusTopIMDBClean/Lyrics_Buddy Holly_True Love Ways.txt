Just you know why
Why you and I
Will by and by
Know true love ways
Sometimes well sigh
Sometimes well cry
And well know why
Just you and I
Know true love ways
Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Sometimes well sigh
Sometimes well cry
And well know why
Just you and I
Know true love ways
Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Sometimes well sigh
Sometimes well cry
And well know why
Just you and I
Know true love ways
