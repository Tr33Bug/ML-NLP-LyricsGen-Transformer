Umm Oh Yeah  Dearest  LyricsDearest  though youre the nearest to my heart
Please dont ever  umm yeah
Ever say well part
You scold and you were so bold
Years together  umm yeah
Our love will grow old  umm yeah
Our love will grow old
You may be a million miles away
Please believe me  umm yeah
When you hear me say
I love you  I love you
Come home  keep me from these sleepless nights
Try my love again  umm yeah
Im gonna treat you right  umm yeah
Im gonna treat you right
