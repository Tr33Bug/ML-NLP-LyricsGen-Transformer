Ummm Oh Yeah  Dearest  Lyrics
Dearest though youre the nearest to my heart
Please dont ever  Ummm yeah  ever say well part
You scold and you are so bold
Yes together  Ummm yeah  our love will grow old
Ummm yeah  Our love will grow old
You may be a million miles away
Please believe me  Ummm yeah  when you hear me say
I love you I love you
Come home keep me from these sleepless nights
Try my love again  Ummm yeah 
Im going to treat you right  Ummm yeah 
Im going to treat you right
