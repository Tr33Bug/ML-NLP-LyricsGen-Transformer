You said that you were leaving me
You were going to let me be
But now I find you here
I loved you but dont you love me too
But you said Id never do
Now you and I are through
I loved you then my darling I loved you every day
But it seems my darling your love just fades away
You loved me but I just dont care
About the new love that Ill share
And you and I are through
I loved you then my darling I loved you every day
But it seems my darling your love just fades away
