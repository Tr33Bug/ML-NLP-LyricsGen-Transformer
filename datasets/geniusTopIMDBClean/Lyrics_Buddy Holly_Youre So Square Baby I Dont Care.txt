Youre So Square  Baby I Dont Care Lyrics
You dont like crazy music
You dont like rocking bands
You just want to go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands
Youre so square
Baby I dont care
I dont know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess its just because
Youre so square
Baby I dont care
You dont know any dance steps that I do
I only know I love you like I do
I do I do
I dont know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess its just because
Baby I dont care
Baby I dont care
Care care care
