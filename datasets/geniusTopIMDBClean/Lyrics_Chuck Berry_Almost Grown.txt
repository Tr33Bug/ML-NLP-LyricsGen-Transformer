You know Im almost grown
Yeah and Im doing all right in school
They aint said I broke no rule
I aint never been in Dutch
I dont carouse around too much
Dont bother me leave me alone
Anyway Im almost grown
I dont run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
Im going to buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park
Dont bother us leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown
Got my eye on a little girl
Ah shes really out of this world
Now I take her to a dance
We started talkin about romance
Dont bother us leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown
You know Im still living in town
But I done married and settled down
Now I really have a ball
So I dont browse around at all
Dont bother us leave us alone
Anyway we almost grown
