Eight oclock in the morning
And Im moving on out to school
With an open book and a sleepy look
The teacher cant be fooled
I catch a pass in an early class
The teacher will never know
That I postponed my work at home
Watching the evening show
Hey there Anthony boy
Why you in such a rush
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him hes a blush
Three oclock in the afternoon
Completes a day of school
Before the ding can cease the ring
Hes in the vestibule
Betty and Barbara and Jeanie and Jane
Are yackityyacking with Joan
About some things that Anthony
Told her over the telephone
Hey there Anthony boy
Why you in such a rush
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him hes a blush
Hey there Anthony boy
Why you in such a rush
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him hes a blush
Betty told me the secret
That I had told her not to tell
Now that you know she knows I know
You know that all is well
Come come Tony me boy
Now dont let em get in your hair
With a good education you may
Become a multimillionaire
Hey there Anthony boy
Why you in such a rush
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him hes a blush
