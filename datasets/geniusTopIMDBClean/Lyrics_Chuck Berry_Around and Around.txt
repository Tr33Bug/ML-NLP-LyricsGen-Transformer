Around and Around Lyrics
They say the joint was rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stop a rocking
Till the moon went down

Oh, it sound so sweet
Gotta take me a chance
Rose out of my seat
Just had to dance
Started moving my feet
Well and clapping my hands
Well the joint started rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down


Twelve o'clock
Well the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Well the place was packed
When the police knocked
Both doors flew back

But they kept on a-rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down

What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
But the joint kept rocking
Going 'round and 'round
Yeah, reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went downEmbed
