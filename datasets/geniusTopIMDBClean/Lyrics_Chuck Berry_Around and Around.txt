They say the joint was rocking
Going round and round
Yeah reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stop a rocking
Till the moon went down
Oh it sound so sweet
Gotta take me a chance
Rose out of my seat
Just had to dance
Started moving my feet
Well and clapping my hands
Well the joint started rocking
Going round and round
Yeah reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
Twelve oclock
Well the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Well the place was packed
When the police knocked
Both doors flew back
But they kept on arocking
Going round and round
Yeah reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
But they kept on arocking
Going round and round
Yeah reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
But the joint kept rocking
Going round and round
Yeah reeling and a rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Till the moon went down
