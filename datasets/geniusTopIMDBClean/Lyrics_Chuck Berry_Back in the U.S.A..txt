Back in the USA LyricsOh well oh well I feel so good today
We just touched ground on an international runway
Jet propelled back home from over seas to the USA
New York Los Angeles oh how I yearned for you
Detroit Chicago Chattanooga Baton Rouge
Let alone just to be at my home back in old St Lou
Did I miss the skyscrapers did I miss the long freeway
From the coast of California to the shores of The Delaware Bay
You can bet your life I did till I got back in the USA
Looking hard for a drivein searching for a corner cafe
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day
Yeah and a jukebox jumping the records like in the USA
Well Im so glad Im livin in the USA
Yes Im so glad Im livin in the USA
Anything you want we got it right here in the USA
Im so glad Im livin in the USA
Yes Im so glad Im livin in the USA
