Beautiful Delilah sweet as apple pie
Always gets a second look from fellas passing by
Every time you see her shes with a different guy
Beautiful Delilah thats the reason why
Rebecka dont allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantalizing
You just cant be true
Beautiful Delilah dressed in the latest style
Swinging like a pendulum walking down the aisle
Deep romantic eyes speak so low in miles
Maybe she will settle down and marry after a while
Rebecka dont allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantalizing
You just cant be true
Beautiful Delilah bathing in the sun
An audience of 17 and notice not a one
Local casanova who wouldnt be outdone
Let her steal his heart away and break it just for fun
Rebecka dont allow me
Fool around with you
You are so tantalizing
You just cant be true
