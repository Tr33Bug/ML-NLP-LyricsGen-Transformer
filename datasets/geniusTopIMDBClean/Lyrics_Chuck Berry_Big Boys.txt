When I was just a little boy like you
I wanted to do things the big boys do
Wherever they went you knew they wouldnt let me go
And I got suspicious and I wanted to know
I was bright in school but my future looked dim
Cause the big boys wouldnt let me party with them
Yes yes
I didnt cry
Yes yes
And you know why
Yes yes
I knew when and what
Yes yes
No ifs ands or buts
I was looking for joy
Yes yes yes yes
When I was little bitty boy
All of the big girls with their to
When I ask em whats happening nobody knew
But when I found out where what when and why
I didnt let a single week pass by
Till the school dance when I first met you
And I learned to party like the big boys do
Yes yes
I didnt cry
Yes yes
And you know why
Yes yes
I knew when and what
Yes yes
No ifs ands or buts
I was looking for joy
Yes yes yes yes
When I was little bitty boy
If I would have known what makes a world go round
I would have known what goes up must come down
If you love me like I love you
Mademoiselle je vous aime voulezvous
The girls want to stay and the boys want to play
So lets arock and roll till the break of day


Yes yes
I didnt cry
Yes yes
And you know why
Yes yes
I knew when and what
Yes yes
No ifs ands or buts
I was looking for joy
Yes yes yes yes
When I was little bitty boy
