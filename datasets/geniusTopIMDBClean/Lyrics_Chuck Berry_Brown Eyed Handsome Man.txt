Arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sittin in the witness stand
The judges wife called up the district attorney
She said Free that browneyed man
If you want your job youd better free that brown eyed man
Flyin across the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walkin cross the sand
She been walkin 30 miles en route to Bombay
To meet a browneyed handsome man
Her destination was a browneyed handsome man
Way back in history 3000 years
In fact ever since the world began
Theres been a whole lotta good women sheddin tears
Over a browneyed handsome man
Its a lot of trouble for the browneyed handsome man
Beautiful daughter couldnt make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her Darling go out and find
Yourself a browneyed handsome man
Just like your daddy hes a browneyed handsome man
Marlo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To meet a browneyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a browneyed handsome man
Twothree the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Roundin third he was headed for home
It was a browneyed handsome man
That won the game it was a browneyed handsome man
