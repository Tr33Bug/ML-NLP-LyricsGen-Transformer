She drew out all her money at the Southern Trust
And put her little boy aboard a Greyhound bus
Leaving Louisiana for the Golden West
Down came the tears from her happiness
Her own little son name Johnny B Goode
Was going to make some motion pictures out in Hollywood
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny
Goodbye Johnny B Goode
She remembered taking money out from gathering crop
And buying Johnnys guitar at a broker shop
As long as he would play it by the railroad side
And wouldnt get in trouble he was satisfied
But never thought that there would come a day like this
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny
Byebye Johnny B Goode
She finally got the letter she was dreaming of
And Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for her by the railroad track
So every time they heard the locomotive roar
Theyd be a standing a waving in the kitchen door
Howling bye bye bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye Johnny
Goodbye Johnny B Goode
