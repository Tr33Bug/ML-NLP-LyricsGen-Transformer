Oh Carol dont let him steal your heart away
Im going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Climb into my machine so we can cruise on out
I know a swinging little joint where we can jump and shout
Its not too far back off the highway not so long a ride
You park your car out in the open you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her maam
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed
Oh Carol dont let him steal your heart away
Im going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
And if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight pat your foot dont let them carry it away
Dont let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Oh dont the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
You cant dance I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby because you dance so good
Oh Carol dont let him steal your heart away
Im going to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Dont let him steal your heart away
Ive got to learn to dance if it takes you all night and day
Oh Carol
