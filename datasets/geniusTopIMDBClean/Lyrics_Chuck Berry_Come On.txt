Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted
All day long Im walking cause I couldnt get my car started
Laid off from my job and I cant afford to check it
I wish somebodyd come along and run into it and wreck it
Come on since my baby parted come on
I cant get started come on
I cant afford to check it
I wish somebodyd come along and run into it and wreck it
Everything is wrong since I been without you
Every night I lay awake thinking about you
Every time the phone rings sounds like thunder
Some stupid jerk trying to reach another number
Come on since I been without you come on
Steady thinking about you come on
Phone sounds like thunder
Some stupid jerk trying to reach another number
Everything is wrong since I last saw you baby
I really want to see you and I dont mean maybe
Im doing everything trying to make you see
That I belong to you honey and you belong to me
So come on I want to see you baby come on
I dont mean maybe come on
Im trying to make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me
Come on
Tell me something baby come on
