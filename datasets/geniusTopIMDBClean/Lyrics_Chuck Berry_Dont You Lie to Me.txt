Lets talk it over baby fore we start
I heard about the way that you overdo your part
Dont lie to me dont you lie to me
Cause it makes me mad and I get shook up as a man can be
Theres two kind of people that I just cant stand
And thats a lying woman and a cheating man
Dont lie to me dont you lie to me
Cause it makes me mad and I get shook up as a man can be
I can love you baby till the cows come home
But Im so sick and tired of you treating me wrong
Dont lie to me dont you lie to me
Cause it makes me mad and I get evil as a man can be
If you love me baby and it aint no lie
Well Ill be with you baby till the river run dry
Dont lie to me dont you lie to me
Cause it makes me mad and I get evil as a man can be
