Now if you want to hear some boogie like Im going to play
Its just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer mans a cat they call Kicking McCoy
I know you remember that rubberlegged boy
Mamas cooking chicken fried and bacon grease
Come on along boys its just down the road apiece
Now theres a place you really get your kicks
Its open every night from about twelve to six
And if you want to get some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting to you like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road down the road down the road apiece
Now theres a place you really get your kicks
Its open every night from about twelve to six
And if you want to get some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting to you like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road down the road down the road apiece
