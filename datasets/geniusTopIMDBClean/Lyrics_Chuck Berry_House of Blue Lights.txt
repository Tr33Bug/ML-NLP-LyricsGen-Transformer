Pull up your jeans and we will truck on down
A knocked out joint at the edge of town
A real homecoming for all you cats
You keep a walking til you see that welcome mat
Fall in there lose your lead
At the house the house of blue lights
We have the time and well cut a rug
And if you dig that jive like it should be dug
A real homecoming for all the cats
You keep a walking til you see that welcome mat
Drop in there get your lead
At the house the house of blue lights
Fryers Broilers Detroit Barbecued Ribs
You get the hit of the week
When you dig that real fine jive
With the welcome beat
Fall in there lose your lead
At the house the house of blue lights
Fryers Broilers Detroit Barbecued Ribs
You get the treat of the week
When you dig that real fine jive
With the welcome beat
Fall in there lose your lead
At the house the house of blue lights
