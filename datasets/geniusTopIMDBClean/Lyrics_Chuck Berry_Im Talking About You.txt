Let me tell you about a girl I know
I met her walking down a uptown street
Shes so fine you know I wished she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet
Im talking bout you
Nobody but you
Yeah I do mean you
Im just trying to get a message to you
Let me tell you about a girl I know
I tell you now she looks so good
Got so much skills such a beautiful will
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood
Im talking bout you
Nobody but you
Come on and give me a cue
So I can get a message to you
Let me tell you bout a girl I know
Shes sitting right here by my side
Lovely indeed that why I asked if she
Promised someday she will be my bride
Im talking bout you

Nobody but you
Come on let me get a message through
