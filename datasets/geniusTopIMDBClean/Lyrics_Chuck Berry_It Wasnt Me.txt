It Wasnâ€™t Me Lyrics
It wasn't me, baby; no, it wasn't me, baby
It must have been some other body, uh uh, baby, it wasn't me

Said he was cold, tired and hungry, came a-begging for bread
The lady took him in and fed him breakfast in bed

It wasn't me, boss; mmm-mmm, boss, it wasn't me
It must have been some other body, uh uh, boss, it wasn't me
You say you saw my car parked in the drive-in one night
Came over to speak to me, I was out of sight

It wasn't me, baby, mmm-mmm, baby, it wasn't me
It must have been some other body, uh uh, baby, it wasn't me

Yes, a shrewd young whipper snapper love to run and play
But the draft board got him, they inducted him today

It wasn't me, Sergeant; mmm, Sergeant, it wasn't me
It must have been some other body, uh uh, Sarge, it wasn't me

I met a German girl in England who was going to school in France
Said we danced in Mississippi at a Alpha Kappa dance

It wasn't me, Officer; no, Officer, it wasn't me
It must have been some other body, uh uh, Officer, it wasn't me

Wailing down the freeway, testing out the cruising power
The state trooper trailing, clocked him ninety miles per hour
You might also like
It wasn't me, Sheriff; mmm-mmm, Sheriff, it wasn't me
Ah! It must have been some other body, uh uh, Sheriff, it wasn't me

Calling for brave young soldiers, needed on the front row
Lieutenant said, "Which one of y'all volunteer to go?"

It wasn't me, Captain; mmm-mmm, Captain, it wasn't me
It must have been some other body, mmm-mmm, Captain, it wasn't meEmbed
