Slow down little Jaguar
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford
Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road
Twas a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford
Jaguar setting on ninetynine
Tryin to beat the Bird to the county line
Just a halfamile from Ludenville
Had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill
It said 35 miles and stay in line
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign
Slow down little Jaguar
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford
Ludenville was a real small town
Had a hundred and two and nine acres of ground
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise
Told him Park down in Ludenville and catch em guys
Sheriff laid low down hid in the weeds
Parked for eight days didnt nobody speed
All of a sudden dust rose on the road
Said Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford
Slow down little Jaguar
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford
Sheriff doubled clutched second put it in third
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird
He knew hed get a bonus and a big fat fine
If he caught em fore they crossed that county line
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat
But if he aimed to get em hed have to do more than that
Crest of the hill is about a yard behind
There wasnt but two more miles to the county line


Slow down little Jaguar
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford
Old Sheriff was countin on the downward grade
With the tall wind pushin he had it made
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin speed
And waved Goodbye Jaguar and pulled in the lead
Jaguar said You aint won the race yet
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet
Sheriffs front bumper was a yard behind
When the TBird Jaguar crossed the line
Slow down little Jaguar
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford
