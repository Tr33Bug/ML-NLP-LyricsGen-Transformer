In the heat of the day
Down In mobile Alabama
Working on the railroad
With the steeldriving hammer
I gotta make some money
To buy some brand new shoes
Tryin to find somebody
To take away these blues
She dont love me
Hear them singing in the sun
Paydays coming when my work is all done
Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a teepee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up your belongings boys and scatter about
Weve got an offschedule train comin two miles out
Everybodys scrambling n jumping around
Picking up their money
Tearing the teepee down
Foreman wants to panic
Bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blows the whistle long and long
Cant stop the train
You have to let it roll on
