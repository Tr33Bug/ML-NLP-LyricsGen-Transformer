Little Queenie Lyrics
I got lumps in my throat
When I saw her comin' down the aisle
I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

Meanwhile I was thinking...
Well if she's in the mood
No need to break it
I got the chance, and I oughta take it
If she'll dance, then we can make it
Come on queenie, let's shake it
Go, go, go, little queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie

Tell me, who's the queen
Standing over by the record machine
Lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

Meanwhile, I was still thinkin ...
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, that'll get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
C'mon queenie, let's get with it

Go, go, go, little queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie
Go, go, go, little queenie
