I got lumps in my throat
When I saw her comin down the aisle
I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Lookin like a model on the cover of a magazine
Shes too cute to be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was thinking
Well if shes in the mood
No need to break it
I got the chance and I oughta take it
If shell dance then we can make it
Come on queenie lets shake it
Go go go little queenie
Go go go little queenie
Go go go little queenie
Tell me whos the queen
Standing over by the record machine
Lookin like a model on the cover of a magazine
Shes too cute to be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was still thinkin 
If its a slow song well omit it
If its a rocker thatll get it
And if its good shell admit it
Cmon queenie lets get with it
Go go go little queenie
Go go go little queenie
Go go go little queenie
