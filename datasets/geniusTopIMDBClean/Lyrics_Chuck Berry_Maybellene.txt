Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started doing the things you used to do
As I was motorvatin over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille
A Cadillac arollin on the open road
Nothin will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin bout ninetyfive
We was bumper to bumper rollin side to side
Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do
A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four
The Ford got hot and wouldnt do no more
It done got a cloud and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin lane
The rain water blowin all under my hood
I knew that was doin my motor good
Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do
The motor cooled down the heat went down
And thats when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac asittin like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin like its sittin still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill


Maybellene why cant you be true
Oh Maybellene why cant you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do
