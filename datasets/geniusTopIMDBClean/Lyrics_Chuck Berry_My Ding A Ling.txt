When I was a little bitty boy
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hangin on a string
She told me it was my ding a ling ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling
When mamma took me to Sunday School
They tried to teach me the golden rule
Every time the choir would sing
Id sit there and play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling
When Pa started me to Grammar School
I found a place in the vestibule
And every time the bell would ring
Theyd catch me playin with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
Once I was climbing the garden wall
Oh and I had an awful fall
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
But I never let go of my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
I remember the girl next door
We used to play house on the kitchen floor
Shed be the queen Id be the king
Together wed play with my ding a ling a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
This here song it is so sad
To those of you who never had
Silver bells hanging on a string
So you could play with your own ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
All come on now everybody sing
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling
My ding a ling my ding a ling
I want to play with my ding a ling  One more time
