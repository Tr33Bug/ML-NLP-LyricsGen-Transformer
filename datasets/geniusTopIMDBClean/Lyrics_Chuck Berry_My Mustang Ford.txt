I got a 1966 cherry red Mustang Ford
Its got a three hundred and eighty five horsepower over load
You know its way too fast to be crawling on these interstate roads
I broke her in at the airport on a runway at the JFK
I just touched the gas pedal and like to ran off into Jamaica Bay
I had to spin the wheels backwards or the momentum would have carried me away
Its getting to be a big problem trying to figure the best possible route
I tried to stop in Indianapolis once and had to back up from Terre Haute
But now I can slow and stop her with my windbreaker parachute
