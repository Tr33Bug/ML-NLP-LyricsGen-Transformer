As I got on a city bus and found my vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver Hey conductor you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off the bus
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine honey is that you
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you got something else to do
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin through the crowd trying to get to where shes at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine honey where are you
Seems like every time I catch you
But youre up to something new
Downtown searching for her looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
I caught a loaded taxi paid up everybodys tab
Flip the twenty dollar bill and told him catch that yellow cab
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine honey is that you
Seems like every time I catch you
Youre up to something new
She moved around like a wayward summer breeze
Go driver go go on catch her for me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear
Nadine honey is that you
Oh Nadine honey is that you
Seems like every time I see you darling
Youre up to something new
