Nadine Lyrics
As I got on a city bus and found my vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver, "Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her, please let me off the bus"

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey is that you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling, you got something else to do
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd trying to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey where are you?
Seems like every time I catch you
But you're up to something new

Downtown searching for her, looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
Flip the twenty dollar bill and told him catch that yellow cab

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey is that you?
Seems like every time I catch you
You're up to something new

She moved around like a wayward summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go on, catch her for me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear
You might also like
Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey is that you?
Seems like every time I see you, darling
You're up to something new1Embed
