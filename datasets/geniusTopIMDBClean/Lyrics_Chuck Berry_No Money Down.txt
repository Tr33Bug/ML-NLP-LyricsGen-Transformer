As I was motivating back in town
I saw a Cadillac sign saying No Money Down
So I eased on my brakes and I pulled in the drive
Gunned my motor twice then I walked inside
Dealer came to me said Trade in your Ford
And Ill put you in a car thatll eat up the road
Just tell me what you want and then sign that line
And Ill have it brought down to you in a hours time
Im going to get me a car
And Ill be headed on down the road
Then I wont have to worry
About that broken down ragged Ford
Well Mister I want a yellow convertible four door De Ville
With a Continental spare and a wire chrome wheel
I want power steering and power brakes
I want a powerful motor with a jet offtake
I want air condition I want automatic heat
And I want a full Murphy bed in my back seat
I want shortwave radio I want TV and a phone
You know I got to talk to my baby when Im riding alone
Yes Im going to get that car
And Im going to head on down the road
Yeah then I wont have to worry
About that broken down ragged Ford
I want four carburetors and two straight exhausts
Im burning aviation fuel no matter what the cost
I want railroad air horns and a military spot
And I want a five year guarantee on everything I got
I want ten dollar deductible I want twenty dollar notes
I want thirty thousand liability thats all she wrote
I got me a car
And Im headed on down the road
No money down I dont have to worry
About that broken down ragged Ford
