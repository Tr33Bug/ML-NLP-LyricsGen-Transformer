Oh Baby Doll
When bells ring out the summer free
Oh baby doll
Will it end for you and me
Well sing our old Alma Mater
And think of things that used to be
I remember it so well
Back when the weather was cool
We used to have so much fun
When we were walking to school
If we stopped off to hear
The latest songs they sing
And we just make it in
Before the bells would ring
Oh Baby Doll
When bells ring out the summer free
Oh baby doll
Will it end for you and me
Well sing our old Alma Mater
And think of things that used to be
When the teacher was gone
Thats when wed have a ball
We use to dance and play
All up and down the hall
We had a portable radio
We was balling the jack
Wed be all back in order
When the teacher got back
Oh Baby Doll
When bells ring out the summer free
Oh baby doll
Will it end for you and me
Well sing our old Alma Mater
And think of things that used to be
