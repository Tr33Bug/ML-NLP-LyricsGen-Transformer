Oh Louisiana I stayed away from you too long
Oh Louisiana how can a true love go so wrong
She put me in shame and in sorrow and I come home tomorrow
Oh Louisiana
Oh Louisiana yeah yeah Creole baby Cajun queens
Quaint porches and windows filet de gumbo the Basin beans
Your beautiful Delta and bayous in greens
Oh Louisiana
Oh Louisiana yeaee yeah Im flying on Delta Nineothree
Right over St Louis high over Memphis Tennessee
On southward to the sea where I long to be
Oh Louisiana
Oh Louisiana yeah yeah them Yankee nights are cold and long
Oh Louisiana she broke my heart and wrecked my home
She shamed me in sorrow to face my tomorrow
Oh take me back oh Louisiana
Mmm mmm Louisiana
Oh Louisiana
