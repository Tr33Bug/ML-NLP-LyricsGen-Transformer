Sometimes I will then again I think I wont
Sometimes I will then again I think I wont
Sometimes I do then again I think I dont
Well I looked at my watch it was 921
We was at a rocknroll dance having nothing but fun
And we rolled reelin and a rockin
We was reelin and rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch it was 932
Theres nothing Id rather do than dance with you
And we rolled reelin and a rockin
We was reelin and rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch it was 943
And everytime I spinned she spinned with me
And we reeled reelin and rockin
We was reelin and a rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch it was 954
I said Dance ballerina girl go go go
And we rolled reelin and a  rockin
We was reelin and a rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch it was 1005
Man I didnt know if I was dead or alive
And I was rollin reelin and rockin
We was reelin and rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn


Well I looked at my watch it was 1026
But Im gonna keep on dancing toll I get my kicks
And we reeled reelin and rockin
We was reelin and a rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch it was 1028
I gotta get my kicks before it get too late
And we reeled reelin and rockin
We was reelin and a rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch it was 1029
I had to hold her hand she was still holding mine
As we reeled reelin and a rockin
We was reelin and a rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch and to my surprise
I was dancing with a woman that was twice my size
I was reelin reelin and rockin
I was reelin and a rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
Well I looked at my watch and it was time to go
The bandleader said We aint playing no more
And we was reelin reelin and a rockin
We was reelin and a rockin
Rollin til the break of dawn
