Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
Thats why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man they were blowing like a hurricane
Thats why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
Theyre drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Dont care to hear em play a tango
Aint in the mood to take a mambo
Its way too early for the congo
So keep a rockin that piano
So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it
Any old time you use it
Its gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
