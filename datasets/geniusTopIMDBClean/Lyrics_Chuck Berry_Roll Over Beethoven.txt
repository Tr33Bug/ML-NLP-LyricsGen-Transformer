Well Imma write a little letter
Im gonna mail it to my local DJ
Yeah its a jumpin little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today
You know my temperatures risin
The jukebox blowin a fuse
My hearts beatin rhythm
And my soul keep asingin the blues
Roll over Beethoven
Tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got the rockin pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rollin arthritis
Sittin down at a rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
They rockin in two by two
Well if you feel and like it
Go get your lover then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock with
One another
Roll over Beethoven
Dig these rhythm and blues
Well early in the mornin and Im givin you my warnin
Dont you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle Ima play my fiddle
Aint got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she wiggle like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see him reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music wont never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven dig these rhythm and blues
