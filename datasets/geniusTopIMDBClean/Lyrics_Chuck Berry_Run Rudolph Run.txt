Out of all the reindeers you know youre the mastermind
Run run Rudolph Randolph aint too far behind
Run run Rudolph Santas got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph cause Im reeling like a merrygoround
Said Santa to a boy Child what have you been longing for
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star
Run run Rudolph Santa has to make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph reeling like a merrygoround
Run run Rudolph Santas got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph Im reeling like a merrygoround
Said Santa to a girl Child what would please you most to get
A little baby doll that can cry sleep drink and wet
And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a Saber jet
Run run Rudolph Santas got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph Im reeling like a merrygoround
