School Day  Ring Ring Goes The Bell  Lyrics
Up in the mornin and out to school
The teacher is teachin the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You study em hard and hopin to pass
Workin your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you wont leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchrooms ready to sell
Youre lucky if you can find a seat
Youre fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
Gee but the teacher dont know how mean she looks
Soon as three oclock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something thats really hot
With the one you love youre makin romance
All day long you been wanting to dance
Feelin the music from head to toe
Round and round and round you go
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something thats really hot
With the one you love youre makin romance
All day long you been wanting to dance
Feelin the music from head to toe
Round and round and round you go


Hail hail rocknroll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rocknroll
The beat of the drum is loud and bold
Rock rock rocknroll
The feelin is there body and soul
