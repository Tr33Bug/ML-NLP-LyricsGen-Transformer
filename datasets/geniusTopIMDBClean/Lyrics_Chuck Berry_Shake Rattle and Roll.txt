Get up out of that bed and wash your face and hands
Get on in that kitchen make some noise with them pots and pans
Aget to cookin my breakfast cause you know Im a working man
You aint been wearin no bra you just lettin em boogie joogie bow
You keep on wearin short dresses with the hem halfway your thigh
And I could see your little bikini bathing suit when the wind is high
Well come on and now shake it rattle it and roll it
I said shake it rattle it and roll it
I said shake it rattle it and roll it
Come on shake it rattle it and roll it
You wont do nothing right if even meant to save your doggone soul
Child Im like a oneeyed cat peeping in a seafood store
Ive been watching you sneaking out creeping in that back door
I can tell the way youre acting I believe you been around this whore
I believe youre doing me wrong and now I know
The bigger money I make the more you wanna spend my dough
You better get yourself together or I aint gonna love you no more
Come on baby now shake it rattle it and roll it
I said shake it rattle it and roll it
I said shake it rattle it and roll it
Come on shake it rattle it and roll it
You wont do nothing right if even meant to save your doggone soul
