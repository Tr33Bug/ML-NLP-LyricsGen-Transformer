At nine years old and sweet as she can be
All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree
Dancing and humming a rockroll melody
Shes the daughter of a wellrespected man
Who taught her how to judge and understand
Since she became a rockroll music fan
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Her daddy dont have to scold her
Her partner cant hardly hold her
She never gets any older
Sweet little rock and roller
Shouldve seen her eyes when the band began to play
And the famous singers sang and barred away
When the stars performed she screamed and yelled Hooray
Ten thousand eyes were watching them leave the floor
Five thousand tongues were screaming More More
And about fifteen hundred waitin outside the door
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
Sweet little rock and roller
