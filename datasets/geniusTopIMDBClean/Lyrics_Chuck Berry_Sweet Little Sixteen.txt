Theyre really rockin in Boston
In Pittsburgh PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And round the Frisco Bay
All over St Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen
Sweet Little Sixteen
Shes just got to have
About a half a million
Famed autographs
Her wallet filled with pictures
She gets them one by one
Becomes so excited
Watch her look at her run boy
Oh Mommy Mommy
Please may I go
Its such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh Daddy Daddy
I beg of you
Whisper to Mommy
Its alright with you
Cause theyll be rockin on Bandstand
In Philadelphia PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And round the Frisco Bay

All over St Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen
Cause theyll be rockin on Bandstand
In Philadelphia PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And round the Frisco Bay
All over St Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with ooh
Sweet Little Sixteen
Sweet Little Sixteen
Shes got the grownup blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
Shes sportin high heel shoes
Oh but tomorrow morning
Shell have to change her trend
And be sweet sixteen
And back in class again
Well theyll be rockin in Boston
Pittsburgh PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
And round the Frisco Bay
Way out in St Louis
Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen
