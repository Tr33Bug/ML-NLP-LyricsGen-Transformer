Thirty Days Lyrics
I'm gonna to give you thirty days to get back home
I done called up a Gypsy woman on the telephone
Gonna send out a world wide hoodoo
That'll be the very thing that'll suit ya
I'm going to see that you be back home in thirty days

Oh thirty days (Thirty days!)
Oh thirty days (Thirty days!)
Baby I'ma see that you be back home in thirty days
Well, she going to send out a world wide hoodoo
That'll be the very thing that'll suit ya
I'm going to see that you be back home in thirty days
And I talked to the judge in private early this morning
And he took me to the sheriff's office to sign a warrant
Going to put a cross charge again' ya
That'll be the very thing that'll send ya
I'm going to see that you be back home in thirty days

Oh, thirty days (Thirty days)
Oh, thirty days (Thirty days)
I'm going to see that you be back home in thirty days
Yeah, I'm going to put a false charge again' ya
That'll be the very thing that'll send ya
I'm going to see that you be back home in thirty days

If I don't get no satisfaction from the judge
I'm going to take it to the FBI and voice my grudge
If they don't give me no consolation
I'm going to take it to the United Nations
I'm going to see that you be back home in thirty days

Oh thirty days! (Thirty days)
Oh thirty days! (Thirty days)
Babe I'ma to see that you
Be back home in thirty days (Thirty days)
You don't give me no consolation
I'm going to take it to the United Nations
I'm going to see that you be back home in thirty daysYou might also likeEmbed
