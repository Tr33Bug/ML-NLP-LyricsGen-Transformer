Too Much Monkey Business Lyrics
Running to-and-fro, hard working at the mill
Never fail, in the mail, yeah come a rotten bill

Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Salesman talking to me, trying to run me up a creek
Says you can buy, go on try it
You can pay me next week, ahh!
Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Blonde haired, good looking trying to get me hooked
Want me to marry, get a home
Settle down, write a book, ahh!

Too much monkey business too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Same thing every day getting up, going to school
No need for me complaining, my objection's overruled, ahh!

Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Pay phone, something wrong, dime gone, will mail
I ought to sue the operator for telling me a tale, ahh!

Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
You might also like
Been to Yokohama been fighting in the war
Army bunk, Army chow, Army clothes, Army car, ahh!

Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in

Working in the filling station, too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires
Check the oil, a dollar gas, ahh!

Too much monkey business, too much monkey business
I don't want your botheration, get away, leave me be!Embed
