Tulane and Johnny opened a novelty shop
Back under the counter was the cream of the crop
Everything was clicking and the business was good
Til one day lo and behold an officer stood
Johnny jumped the counter but he stumbled and fell
But Tulane made it over Johnny just as he yelled
Go head on Tulane he cant catch up with you
Go Tulane he aint man enough for you
Go Tulane use all the speed you got
Go Tulane you know you need a lot
Go Tulane hes lagging behind
Go head on Tulane
Go by your fathers house and tell him business is slow
And see if he will loan us something soon as you hit the door
Put the cat out in the hall and rumple up the room
Go by Doctor Keller and tell him you swallowed some perfume
Tell him we need him quick because he may have to testify
That you been sick all day and thats a perfect alibi
Go head on Tulane he cant catch up with you
Go Tulane he aint man enough for you
Go Tulane use all the speed you got
Go Tulane you know you need a lot
Go Tulane hes lagging behind
Go head on Tulane
Go let Daddy drive in case you run into the man
Back by the shop and get the stuff and hide it in the van
Go back by your fathers get the money for the bail
And bring it down and bail me out this rotten funky jail
We gotta get a lawyer in the clique of politics
Somebody who can win the thing or get the thing fixed
Go head on Tulane he cant catch up with you
Go Tulane he aint man enough for you
Go Tulane use all the speed you got
Go Tulane you know you need a lot
Go Tulane hes lagging behind
Go head on Tulane
Go head on
