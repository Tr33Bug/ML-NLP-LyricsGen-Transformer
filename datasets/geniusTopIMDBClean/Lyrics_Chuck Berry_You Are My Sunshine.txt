You are my sunshine my beautiful sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
Youll never know dear how much I love you
Please dont take my sunshine away
Just the other night it happened again as I was trying to get to sleeping
I thought I heard you call my name I thought I saw you looking down at my eye
I woke up screaming hallucination keep me from dreaming
I had to hang my head off the foot of the bed and lay down crying
Oh you are my sunshine my beautiful sunshine
You keep me feeling so happy you keep me feeling happy when my skies are gray
Ah youll never know darling youll never know how much I love you
Please dont take take my sunshine take it away
Baby now you know you told me yes you did that you really really love me
There would never be no one nobody ever come between
And now you done left me you put me down you went and got another lover
Coming out of your shadow voodoo and mojo handle my dream
Ah but youre still my sunshine my beautiful sunshine
Ah you make me happy you make me happy when my skies are gray yeah
Ah youll never know darling youll never know how much I really love you
Ah come and take ah come and take my sunshine away
