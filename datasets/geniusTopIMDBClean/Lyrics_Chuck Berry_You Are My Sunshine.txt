You Are My Sunshine Lyrics
You are my sunshine, my beautiful sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please, don't take my sunshine away

Just the other night, it happened again, as I was trying to get to sleeping
I thought I heard you call my name, I thought I saw you looking down at my eye
I woke up screaming, hallucination, keep me from dreaming
I had to hang my head off the foot of the bed and lay down crying
Oh, you are my sunshine, my beautiful sunshine
You keep me feeling so happy, you keep me feeling happy when my skies are gray
Ah, you'll never know, darling, you'll never know how much I love you
Please, don't take, take my sunshine, take it away

Baby, now you know you told me, yes you did, that you really, really love me
There would never be no one, nobody ever come between
And now you done left me, you put me down, you went and got another lover
Coming out of your shadow, voodoo and mojo handle my dream

Ah, but you're still my sunshine, my beautiful sunshine
Ah, you make me happy, you make me happy when my skies are gray, yeah
Ah, you'll never know, darling, you'll never know how much I really love you
Ah, come and take, ah, come and take my sunshine awayYou might also like2Embed
