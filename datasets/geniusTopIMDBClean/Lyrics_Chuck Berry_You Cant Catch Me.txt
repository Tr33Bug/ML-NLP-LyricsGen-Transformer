You Canâ€™t Catch Me Lyrics
I bought a brand-new air-mobile
It was custom-made, 'twas a Flight De Ville
With a powerful motor and some hideaway wings
Push in on the button and you will hear her sing

Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breeze
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee, wee hours
I was rolling slowly 'cause of drizzling showers
Here come a flat-top, he was moving up with me
Then come waving goodbye in a little old souped-up jitney
I put my foot in my tank and I began to roll
Moaning siren, 'twas a state patrol
So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn
Bye-bye New Jersey, I've become airborne

Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breeze

Flying with my baby last Saturday night
Wasn't a gray cloud floatin' in sight
Big full moon shining up above
Cuddle up honey, be my love
Sweetest little thing I ever seen
I'm going to name you Maybellene
Flying on the beam, set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock and roll
Two, three hours done passed us by
Altitude dropped to five-oh-five
Fuel consumption way too fast
Let's get on home before we run out of gas
You might also like
Now you can't catch me, no baby you can't catch me
'Cause if you get too close
You know I'm gone like a cool breezeEmbed
