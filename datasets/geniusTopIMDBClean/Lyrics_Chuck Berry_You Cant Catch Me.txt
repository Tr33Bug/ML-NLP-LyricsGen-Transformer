I bought a brandnew airmobile
It was custommade twas a Flight De Ville
With a powerful motor and some hideaway wings
Push in on the button and you will hear her sing
Now you cant catch me baby you cant catch me
Cause if you get too close
You know Im gone like a cool breeze
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours
I was rolling slowly cause of drizzling showers
Here come a flattop he was moving up with me
Then come waving goodbye in a little old soupedup jitney
I put my foot in my tank and I began to roll
Moaning siren twas a state patrol
So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn
Byebye New Jersey Ive become airborne
Now you cant catch me baby you cant catch me
Cause if you get too close
You know Im gone like a cool breeze
Flying with my baby last Saturday night
Wasnt a gray cloud floatin in sight
Big full moon shining up above
Cuddle up honey be my love
Sweetest little thing I ever seen
Im going to name you Maybellene
Flying on the beam set on flight control
Radio tuned to rock and roll
Two three hours done passed us by
Altitude dropped to fiveohfive
Fuel consumption way too fast
Lets get on home before we run out of gas


Now you cant catch me no baby you cant catch me
Cause if you get too close
You know Im gone like a cool breeze
