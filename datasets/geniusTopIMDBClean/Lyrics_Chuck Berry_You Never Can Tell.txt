It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work the little money comin worked out well
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hifi phono boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a soupedup jitney was a cherry red 53
And drove it down to Orleans to celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
