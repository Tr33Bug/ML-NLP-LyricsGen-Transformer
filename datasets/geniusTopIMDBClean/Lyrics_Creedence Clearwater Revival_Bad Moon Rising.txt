I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin
I see bad times today
Dont go around tonight
Well its bound to take your life
Theres a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Dont go around tonight
Well its bound to take your life
Theres a bad moon on the rise
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like were in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Well dont go around tonight
Well its bound to take your life
Theres a bad moon on the rise
Dont go around tonight
Well its bound to take your life
Theres a bad moon on the rise
