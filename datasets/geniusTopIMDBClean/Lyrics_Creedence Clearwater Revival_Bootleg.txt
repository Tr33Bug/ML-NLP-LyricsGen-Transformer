Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
Take you a glass of water
Make it against the law
See how good the water tastes
When you cant have any at all
Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
Finding a natural woman
Like honey to a bee
But you dont buzz the flower
When you know the honeys free
Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
Suzy maybe give you some cherry pie
But Lord that aint no fun
Better you grab it when she aint looking
Because you know youd rather have it on the run
Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
Bootleg bootleg
Bootleg howl
