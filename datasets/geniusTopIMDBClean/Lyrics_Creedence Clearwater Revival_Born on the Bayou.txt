Now when I was just a little boy
Standin to my Daddys knee
My papa said Son dont let the man get you
An do what he done to me
Because hell get you
Because  hell get you now now
An I can remember the fourth o July
Runnin through the backwood bare
An I can still hear my ol hound dog barkin
Chasin down a hoodoo there
Chasin down a hoodoo there
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou oh oh
Wish I was back on the Bayou
Rollin with some Cajun Queen
Wishin I were a fast freight train
Im just a chooglin on down to New Orlean
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou mm mm mm
Born on the Bayou
Do it do it do it do it
Oh Lord
Oh get back boy
An I can remember the fourth o July
Runnin through the backwood bare
An I can still hear my ol hound dog barkin
Chasin down a hoodoo there
Chasin down a hoodoo there
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou oh oh
Born on the Bayou
All right Do do do do
Mmmmmmm ohh
