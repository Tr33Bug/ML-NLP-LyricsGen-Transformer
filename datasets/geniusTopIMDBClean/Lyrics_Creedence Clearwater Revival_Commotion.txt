Traffic in the city turns my head around
No no no no no
Backed up on the freeway
Backed up in the church
Everywhere you look theres a frown frown
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Com commotion
Git git git gone
People keep a talking they dont say a word
Jaw jaw jaw jaw jaw
Talk up in the White House talk up to your door
So much going on I just cant hear
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Hurrying to get there so you save some time
Run run run run run
Rushing to the treadmill rushing to get home
Worry bout the time you save save
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Com commotion
Git git git gone
Com commotion
Git git git gone
