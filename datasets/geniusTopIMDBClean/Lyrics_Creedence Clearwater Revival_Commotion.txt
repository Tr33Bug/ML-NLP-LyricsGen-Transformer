Commotion Lyrics
Traffic in the city turns my head around
No, no, no, no, no
Backed up on the freeway
Backed up in the church
Everywhere you look there's a frown, frown

Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
People keep a talking they don't say a word
Jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw, jaw
Talk up in the White House, talk up to your door
So much going on I just can't hear

Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone

Hurrying to get there so you save some time
Run, run, run, run, run
Rushing to the treadmill, rushing to get home
Worry 'bout the time you save, save

Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, gone
Com, commotion
Git, git, git, goneYou might also likeEmbed
