I went down to the station just to take a ride
I went down to the station just to take a ride
Found myself on a flatcar yesterday behind
Pulling out from the platform there was no brass band
I pulled out from the platform nobody raised a hand
And there were no tears of regret from my runaway train
Train
Train
Train
Train
Got no sand in my pocket you know I aint tied down
Aint no sand in my pocket never do sit down
Im just a crosstie walker where the freight trains run
Run
Run
Run
Run
If you see me acoming dont you waste my time
If you see me acoming dont you waste my time
Cause theres more miles between us than the Santa Fe Line
Run
Run
Run
Run
Mmmmmmmmmm
