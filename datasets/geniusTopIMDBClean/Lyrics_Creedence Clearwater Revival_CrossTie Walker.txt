Cross-Tie Walker Lyrics
I went down to the station, just to take a ride
I went down to the station, just to take a ride
Found myself on a flatcar, yesterday behind
Pulling out from the platform, there was no brass band
I pulled out from the platform, nobody raised a hand
And there were no tears of regret from my runaway train
Train
Train
Train
Train
Got no sand in my pocket, you know I ain't tied down
Ain't no sand in my pocket, never do sit down
I'm just a cross-tie walker, where the freight trains run
Run
Run
Run
Run
If you see me a'coming don't you waste my time
If you see me a'coming don't you waste my time
Cause there's more miles between us than the Santa Fe Line
Run
Run
Run
Run
