Dont Look Now  It Aint You or Me  Lyrics
Who will take the coal from the mine
Who will take the salt from the earth
Wholl take a leaf and grow it to a tree
Dont look now it aint you or me
Who will work the field with his hands
Who will put his back to the plough
Wholl take the mountain and give it to the sea
Dont look now it aint you or me
Dont look now someones done your starving
Dont look now someones done your praying too
Who will make the shoes for your feet
Who will make the clothes that you wear
Wholl take the promise that you dont have to keep
Dont look now it aint you or me
Who will take the coal from the mines
Who will take the salt from the earth
Wholl take the promise that you dont have to keep
Dont look now it aint you or me
