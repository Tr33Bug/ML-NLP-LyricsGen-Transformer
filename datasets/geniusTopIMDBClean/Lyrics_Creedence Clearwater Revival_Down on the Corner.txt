Early in the evenin just about supper time
Over by the courthouse theyre starting to unwind
Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp
Down on the corner out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin
Bring a nickel tap your feet
Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poor boy twangs the rhythm out on his Kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance and doubles on kazoo
Down on the corner out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin
Bring a nickel tap your feet
Down on the corner out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin
Bring a nickel tap your feet
You dont need a penny just to hang around
But if youve got a nickel wont you lay your money down
Over on the corner theres a happy noise
People come from all around to watch the magic boy
Down on the corner out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin
Bring a nickel tap your feet
Down on the corner out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin
Bring a nickel tap your feet
Down on the corner out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin
Bring a nickel tap your feet
Down on the corner out in the street
Willy and the Poor Boys are playin
Bring a nickel tap your feet
