Last night
I saw a fire burning on
The palace lawn
Oer the land
The humble subjects watched in mixed
Emotion
Who is burning
Who is burning
Effigy
Who is burning
Who is burning
Effigy
Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The palace door
Silent majority
Werent keeping quiet
Anymore
Who is burning
Who is burning
Effigy
Who is burning
Who is burning
Effigy
Last night
I saw the fire spreading to
The country side
In the morning
Few were left to watch
The ashes die
Who is burning
Who is burning
Effigy
Who is burning
Who is burning
Effigy
Why
Why
Why
Effigy
