Hey look over yonder out in the rain
Soaking wet fever in my brain
Now I aint certain which way to go
But I got to move sure
Feeling blue blue blue blue blue 
Im feeling blue Im feeling blue
Hey look over yonder behind the wall
Theyre closing in Im about to fall
Now Im no coward but I aint no fool
Feel it in my bones my book is due
Hey look over yonder up in the tree
Theres a rope hanging just for me
Without a warning without a warning
Things are piling up to break me down
Hey look over yonder out in the street
People laughing by walking easy
Now Im no sinner but I aint no saint
If its happy you can say I aint
Im Feeling blue
