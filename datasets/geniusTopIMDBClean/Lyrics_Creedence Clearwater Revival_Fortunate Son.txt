Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh theyre red white and blue
And when the band plays Hail to the Chief
Ooh they point the cannon at you Lord
It aint me it aint me
I aint no senators son son
It aint me it aint me
I aint no fortunate one no
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord dont they help themselves no
But when the taxman come to the door
Lord the house lookin like a rummage sale yeah
It aint me it aint me
I aint no millionaires son no no
It aint me it aint me
I aint no fortunate one no
Yeah some folks inherit starspangled eyes
Ooh they send you down to war Lord
And when you ask em How much should we give
Ooh they only answer More more more more
It aint me it aint me
I aint no military son son Lord
It aint me it aint me
I aint no fortunate one one
It aint me it aint me
I aint no fortunate one no no no
It aint me it aint me
I aint no fortunate son no no no
It aint me
