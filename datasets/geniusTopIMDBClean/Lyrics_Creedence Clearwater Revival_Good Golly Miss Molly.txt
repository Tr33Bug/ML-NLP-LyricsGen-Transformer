Good golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and arolling
Cant hear your momma call
From the early early morning till the early early night
You can see Miss Molly rocking at the house of blue lights
Good golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and arolling
Cant hear your momma call
Well now momma poppa told me Son you better watch your step
If I knew my momma poppa have to watch my pop myself
Good golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and arolling
Cant hear your momma call
Were going to the corner gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me if its a nineteencarat golden thing
Good golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and arolling
Cant hear your momma call
Good golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and arolling
Cant hear your momma call
