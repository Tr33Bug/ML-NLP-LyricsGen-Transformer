Good Golly, Miss Molly Lyrics
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling
Can't hear your momma call

From the early early morning till the early early night
You can see Miss Molly rocking at the house of blue lights

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling
Can't hear your momma call
Well, now momma, poppa told me, "Son, you better watch your step"
If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my pop myself

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling
Can't hear your momma call

We're going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen-carat golden thing?

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling
Can't hear your momma call

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and a-rolling
Can't hear your momma callYou might also likeEmbed
