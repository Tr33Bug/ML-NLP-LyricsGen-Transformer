Well take me back down where cool water flow yall
Let me remember things I love Lord
Stoppin at the log where catfish bite
Walkin along the river road at night
Barefoot girls dancin in the moonlight
I can hear the bullfrog callin me aw
Wonder if my ropes still hangin to the tree aw
Love to kick my feet way down the shallow water
Shoo fly dragon fly get back to mother
Pick up a flat rock skip it across Green River
Well
Up at Codys camp I spent my days Lord
With flat car riders and crosstie walkers
Old Cody Junior took me over
Said Youre gonna find the world is smolderin
And if you get lost come on home to Green River
Well
Come on home
