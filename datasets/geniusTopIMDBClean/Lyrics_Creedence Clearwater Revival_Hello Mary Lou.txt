Hello Mary Lou Lyrics
"Hello Mary Lou, Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou, Goodbye heart

Passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oo I wanted you forever more
I'm not one that gets around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before
I said "Hello Mary Lou, Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou, Goodbye heart

Saw your lips I heard your voice
Believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
Thought about a moonlit night
My arms around you good and tight
That's all I had to see for me to say

"Hey, hey, Hello Mary Lou, Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, We'd never part
So Hello Mary Lou, Goodbye heart 
Yes, Hello Mary Lou, Goodbye heartYou might also likeEmbed
