Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou Im so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou Wed never part
So Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart
Passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
And oo I wanted you forever more
Im not one that gets around
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before
I said Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou Im so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou Wed never part
So Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart
Saw your lips I heard your voice
Believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldnt make me stay away
Thought about a moonlit night
My arms around you good and tight
Thats all I had to see for me to say
Hey hey Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou Im so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou Wed never part
So Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart 
Yes Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart
