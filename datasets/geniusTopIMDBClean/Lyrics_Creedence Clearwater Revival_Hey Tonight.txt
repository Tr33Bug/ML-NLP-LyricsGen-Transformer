Hey Tonight Lyrics
Hey, Tonight
Going to be tonight
Don't you know I'm flying
Tonight, tonight
Hey, come on
Going to chase tomorrow
Tonight, tonight

Going to get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's going to get religion
All night long
Hey, come on
Going to hear the sun
Tonight, tonight

Going to get it to the rafters
Watch me now
Jody's going to get religion
All night long

Aaaah!
Hey, Tonight
Gonna be tonight
Don't you know I'm flying
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonightYou might also likeEmbed
