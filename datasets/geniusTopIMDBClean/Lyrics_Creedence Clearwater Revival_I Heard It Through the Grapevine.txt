Oohooh bet youre wondering how I knew
Bout your plan to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys you know I love you more
Took me by surprise I must say when I found out yesterday
Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
And Im just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
You know that a man aint supposed to cry
But these tears I cant hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You couldve told me yourself that you found someone else
Instead
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
And Im just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
People say You hear from what you see
Not not not from what you hear
I cant help but being confused
If its true wont you tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy that you knew before
Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
And Im just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah


Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
And Im just about to lose my mind
Oohooh I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Aahaah I heard it through the grapevine
And Im just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
