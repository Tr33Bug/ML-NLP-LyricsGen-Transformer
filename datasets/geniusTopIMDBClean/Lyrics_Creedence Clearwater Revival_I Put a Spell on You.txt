I put a spell on you
Because youre mine
You better stop
The things that youre doing
I said watch out
I aint lying yeah
I aint gonna take none of your
Fooling around
I aint gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because youre mine
All right
I put a spell on you
Because youre mine
You better stop
The things that youre doing
I said watch out
I aint lying yeah
I aint gonna take none of your
Fooling around
I aint gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because youre mine
All right and I took it down
