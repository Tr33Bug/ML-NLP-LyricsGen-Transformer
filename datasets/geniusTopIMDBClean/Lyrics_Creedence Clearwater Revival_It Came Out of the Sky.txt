It Came Out of the Sky Lyrics
Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't b'lieve what he seen
Laid on the ground and shook, fearing for his life
Then he ran all the way to town screamin' "It came out of the sky"

Well, a crowd gathered 'round and a scientist said it was marsh gas
Spiro came and made a speech about raisin' the Mars tax
The Vatican said, "Woe, the Lord has come"
Hollywood rushed out an epic film
And Ronnie the Popular said it was a communist plot, yeah
Oh, the newspaper came and made Jody a national hero
Walter and Eric said they'd put him on a network TV show
The White House said, "Put the thing in the Blue Room"
The Vatican said, "No, it belongs to Rome"
And Jody said, "It's mine, but you can have it for seventeen million"

Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't b'lieve what he seen
Laid on the ground a-shakin', fearin' for his life
Then he ran all the way to town screamin' "It came out of the sky", yeahYou might also likeEmbed
