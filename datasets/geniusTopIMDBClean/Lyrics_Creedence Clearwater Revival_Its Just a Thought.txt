Its just a thought
But Ive noticed something strange
Getting harder to explain
All the years are passing by and by
Still I dont know what makes it go
Who said to wait and youll see
Its just a thought
But I wondered if you knew
That the song up there is you
They cant take it from you
If you dont give it away
Dont give it away Ooh  Its given away 
Its just a thought
But the word has come too late
That a bad idea will take
Just about a lifetime to explain
And dont you see
Good ones going to be much longer
Whos going to wait just to see
