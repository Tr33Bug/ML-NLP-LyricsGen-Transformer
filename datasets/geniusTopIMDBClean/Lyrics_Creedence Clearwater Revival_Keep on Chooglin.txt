Keep on Chooglinâ€™ Lyrics
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin'

Maybe you don't understand it
But if you're a natural man
You got to ball and have a good time
And that's what I call choogling
Here comes Mary looking for Harry
She going to choogle tonight
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer
He going to choogle tonight
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin'




Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Chooglin', chooglin'

If you can choose it, who can refuse it
Y'all be chooglin' tonight
Go on, take your pick, huh, right from the git go
You got to choogle tonight

Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Keep on chooglin'
Hooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin', chooglin'
