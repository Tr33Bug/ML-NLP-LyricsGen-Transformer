Maybe you dont understand it
But if youre a natural man
You got to ball and have a good time
And thats what I call choogling
Here comes Mary looking for Harry
She going to choogle tonight
Here comes Louie works in the sewer
He going to choogle tonight
Keep on chooglin

Chooglin chooglin chooglin chooglin
Keep on chooglin
Keep on chooglin

Chooglin chooglin
If you can choose it who can refuse it
Yall be chooglin tonight
Go on take your pick huh right from the git go
You got to choogle tonight
Keep on chooglin
Keep on chooglin
Keep on chooglin
Hooglin chooglin chooglin chooglin chooglin chooglin
