Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin my fame and fortune
And lookin for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
Rode in on the Greyhound
Ill be walkin out if I go
I was just passin through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord Im stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
I ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar
For every song I sung
Every time Ive had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know Id catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord Im stuck in Lodi again
