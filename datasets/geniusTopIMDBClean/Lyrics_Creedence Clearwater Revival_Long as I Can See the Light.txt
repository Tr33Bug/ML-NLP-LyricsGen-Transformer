Put a candle in the window
But I feel Ive got to move
Though Im going going Ill be coming home soon
Long as I can see the light
Pack my bag and lets get movin
Cause Im bound to drift a while
Well Im gone gone you dont have to worry no
Long as I can see the light
115  145
Guess Ive got that old travelin bone
Cause this feelin wont leave me alone
But I wont wont be losin my way no no
Long as I can see the light
Yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
Put a candle in the window
But I feel Ive got to move
Though Im going going Ill be coming home soon
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
