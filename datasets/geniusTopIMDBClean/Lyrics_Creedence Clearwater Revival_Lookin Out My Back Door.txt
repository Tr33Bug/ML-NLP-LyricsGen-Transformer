Just got home from Illinois lock the front door oh boy
Got to sit down take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in pretty soon Im singing
Doot doot doo looking out my back door
Theres a giant doing cartwheels a statue wearing high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
A dinosaur Victrola listening to Buck Owens
Doot doot doo looking out my back door
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Wont you take a ride on the flying spoon
Doot doo doo
A wondrous apparition provided by magician
Doot doot doo looking out my back door
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Wont you take a ride on the flying spoon
Doot doo doo
Bother me tomorrow today Ill buy no sorrows
Doot doot doo looking out my back door
Forward troubles Illinois lock the front door oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow today Ill buy no sorrows
Doot doot doo looking out my back door
