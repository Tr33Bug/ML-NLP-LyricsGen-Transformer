Im looking for a reason to stay
Im all wound up and tied in knots today
Im looking for a reason not to go
When the morning comes Ill be on my way
Every night I ask myself again
Just what it was that made our dream begin
It seemed like a good idea way back then
But Im wondering now what daydream took me in
Yesterday I tried once more to find
A way to share the trouble on my mind
It seems like you turn away every time
I used to like it here I cant remember why
