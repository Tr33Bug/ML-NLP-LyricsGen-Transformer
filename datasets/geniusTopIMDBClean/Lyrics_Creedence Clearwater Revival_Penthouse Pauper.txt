Now if I was a bricklayer
I wouldnt build just anything
And if I was a ball player
I wouldnt play no second string
And if I were some jewelry baby
Lord Id have to be a diamond ring
If I were a secret Lord I never would be told
If I were a jug of wine Lord my flavor would be old
I could be most anything
But it got to be twentyfour karat solid gold oh
If I were a gambler You know Id never lose
And if I were a guitar player
Lord Id have to play the blues
If I was a hacksaw My blade would be razor sharp
If I were a politician I could prove that monkeys talk
You can find the tallest building
Lord Id have me the house on top
Oh lets go
All right keep going
Im the penthouse pauper
I got nothing to my name
Im the penthouse pauper baby
I got nothing to my name
I can be most anything
Because when you got nothing its all the same
Oh lets move to this song
Lord look at my penthouse
