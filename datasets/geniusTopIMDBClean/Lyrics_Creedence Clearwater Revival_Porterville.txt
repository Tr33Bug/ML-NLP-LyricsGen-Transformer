Its been an awful long time since I been home
But you wont catch me going back down there alone
Things they said when I was young are quite enough to get me hung
I dont care I dont care 
They came and took my dad away to serve some time
But it was me that paid the debt he left behind
Folks said I was full of sin because I was the next of kin
I dont care I dont care 
Oooooooooooooooo
I dont care I dont care 
Folks were out one night to put me up a fence
And you can guess that Ive been running ever since
Aint no one thats bout to help and Ill keep on I tell myself
I dont care I dont care 
I dont care I dont care
I dont care I dont care 
Aint no one thats bout to help
And Ill keep on I tell myself
I dont care I dont care
I dont care I dont care 
Oooooooooooooooo
I dont care I dont care 
Oooooooooooooooo
I dont care I dont care
I dont care I dont care
I dont care I dont care 
Oooooooooooooooo
I dont care I dont care
I dont care I dont care
I dont care I dont care
