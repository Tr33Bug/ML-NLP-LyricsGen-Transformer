Move down the road I go
Move down the road I go
Theres mud in the water
Roach in the cellar
Bugs in the sugar
Mortgage on the home
Mortgage on the home
Theres garbage on the sidewalk
Highways in the back yard
Police on the corner
Mortgage on the car
Mortgage on the car
Move down the road I go
Theyre selling independence
Actors in the White House
Acid indigestion
Mortgage on my life
Mortgage on my life
Move down the road I go
Ramble tamble
Ramble tamble
Ramble tamble
