Run Through the Jungle Lyrics
Whoa, thought it was a nightmare
Lord, it all so true
They told me, don't go walkin' slow
The Devil's on the loose

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see
Thought I heard a rumblin'
Callin' to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan cries, "Take aim"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see


Over on the mountain
Thunder magic spoke
"Let the people know my wisdom
Fill the land with smoke"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to seeYou might also like7Embed
