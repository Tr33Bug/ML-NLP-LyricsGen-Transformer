Whoa thought it was a nightmare
Lord it all so true
They told me dont go walkin slow
The Devils on the loose
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa dont look back to see
Thought I heard a rumblin
Callin to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan cries Take aim
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa dont look back to see
Over on the mountain
Thunder magic spoke
Let the people know my wisdom
Fill the land with smoke
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa dont look back to see
