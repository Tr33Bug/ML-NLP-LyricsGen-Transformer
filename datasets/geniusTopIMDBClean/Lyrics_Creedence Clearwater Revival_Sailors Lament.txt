Woke up early feeling light  Shame its a shame 
Somebody got to me last night  Shame its a shame 
Sat down for a friendly duel  Shame its a shame 
With oneeyed jacks and jokers too  Shame its a shame 
Ooh sailor man  Shame its a shame  
Poormouth Henry turned on me  Shame its a shame 
Said Boy Im going to pick you clean  Shame its a shame 
Oh
Henry said Dont you mess that pile  Shame its a shame 
Had three aces and he had five  Shame its a shame 
Shame its a shame
