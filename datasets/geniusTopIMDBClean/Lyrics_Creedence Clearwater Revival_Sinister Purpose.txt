When the sky is gray
And the moon is hate
Ill be down to get you
Roots of earth will shake
Sinister purpose
Knocking at your door
Come and take my hand
Burn away the goodness
You and I remain
Did you see the last war
Well here I am again
I can set you free
Make you rich and wise
We can live forever
Look into my eyes
Mmmmmmmm
