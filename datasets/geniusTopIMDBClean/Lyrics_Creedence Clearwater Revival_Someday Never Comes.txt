First thing I remember was asking papa Why
For there were many things I didnt know
And Daddy always smiled took me by the hand
Saying someday youll understand
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son
Youd better learn it fast youd better learn it young
Cause someday never comes
The time and tears went by and I collected dust
For there were many things I didnt know
When Daddy went away he said try to be a man
And someday youll understand
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son
Youd better learn it fast youd better learn it young
Cause someday never comes
And then one day in April I wasnt even there
For there were many things I didnt know
A son was born to me mama held his hand
Saying someday youll understand
Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son
Youd better learn it fast youd better learn it young
Cause someday Never Comes
Ooh someday never comes
Think it was September the year I went away
For there were many things I didnt know
And I still see him standin tryin to be a man
I said someday youll understand


Well Im here to tell you now each and every mothers son
Youd better learn it fast youd better learn it young
Cause someday never comes
Ooh someday never comes
Mmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmm
Hmmmmmmmmm
