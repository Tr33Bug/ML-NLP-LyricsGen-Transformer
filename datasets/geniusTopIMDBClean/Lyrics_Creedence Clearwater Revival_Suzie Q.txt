Suzie Q Lyrics
Oh, Suzie Q, oh, Suzie Q
Oh, Suzie Q, baby I love you
Suzie Q

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk I like the way you talk
Suzie Q

Well, say that you'll be true
Well, say that you'll be true
Well, say that you'll be true and never leave me blue
Suzie Q

Well, say that you'll be mine
Well, say that you'll be mine
Well, say that you'll be mine, baby all the time
Suzie Q


Oh, Suzie Q, oh, Suzie Q

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk, Suzie Q
