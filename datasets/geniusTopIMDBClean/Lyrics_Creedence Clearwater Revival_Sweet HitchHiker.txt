Was riding alongside the highway
Rolling up the countryside
Thinking Im the devils heat wave
What you burn in your crazy mind
Saw a slight distraction standing by the road
She was smiling there yellow in her hair
Do you want to I was thinking Would you care
Sweet hitchahiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitchahiker
Wont you ride on my fast machine
Cruising on through the junction
Im flying about the speed of sound
Noticing peculiar function
Im no roller coaster shut me down
I turned away to see her
Whoa She caught my eye
But I was rolling down moving too fast
Do you want to she was thinking Can it last
Sweet hitchahiker
We could make music at the Greasy King  yeah 
Sweet hitchahiker
Wont you ride on my fast machine
Was busted up along the highway
Im the saddest riding fool alive
Wondering if youre goin my way
Wont you give a poor boy a ride
Now here she comes ariding
Lord shes flying high
She was rolling down moving too fast
Do you want to she was thinking Can I last


Sweet hitchahiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitchahiker
Wont you ride on my fast machine
Sweet hitchahiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitchahiker
Wont you ride on my fast machine
Sweet hitchahiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet hitchahiker
Wont you ride on my fast machine
Sweet hitchahiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
