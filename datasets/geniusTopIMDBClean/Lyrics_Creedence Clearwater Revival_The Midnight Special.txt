Well you wake up in the mornin
You hear the work bell ring
And they march you to the table
You see the same old thing
Aint no food upon the table
And no pork up in the pan
But you better not complain boy
You get in trouble with the man
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a ever lovin light on me
Yonder come miss Rosie
How in the world did you know
By the way she wears her apron
And the clothes she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
She come to see the govnor
She wants to free her man lord
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a ever lovin light on me
If youre ever in Houston
Well you better do the right
You better not gamble
There and you better not fight at all
Or the sheriff will grab ya
And the boys will bring you down
The next thing you know boy
Oh Youre prison bound


Well let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a ever lovin light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine a ever lovin light
On me
