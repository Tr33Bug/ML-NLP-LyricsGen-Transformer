You know the night time oh is the right time
Why do they why do they 
To be with the one you love  Why do they why do they 
I said the night time ooh is the right time  Why do they why do they 
To be with the one you love  Why do they why do they 
I said the night time ooh is the right time
Why do they why do they 
To be with the one you love  Why do they why do they 
Baby  Why do they why do they 
I said a baby  Why do they why do they 
Baby  Why do they why do they why do they 
Come on and drive me crazy Lord  Why do they 
You know I love you always thinking of you
Why do they why do they 
Hey baby oh I said a baby  Why do they why do they 
You know the night time is the right time
Why do they why do they 
To be with the one you love  Why do they 
Aaaah I wanna sing this song
I said the night time  Why do they why do they 
Oh is the right time
Why do they why do they 
To be  Why do they why do they 
With the one you love  Why do they why do they 
I said the night time  Why do they why do they 
Ooh is the right time
Why do they why do they 
To be  Why do they why do they  with the one you love  Why do they why do they 
I said the night time Why do they why do they  ooh is the right time
Why do they why do they 
To be with the one you love
