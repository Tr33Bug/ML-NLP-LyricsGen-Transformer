The Working Man Lyrics
Well, I was born on a sunday; on thursday I had me a job
I was born on a sunday; by thursday I was working out on the job
I ain't never had no day off since I learned right from wrong
Mama said I was bad, I did something to her head
Mama said I was bad, I did something to her head
And poppa threw me out, ooh, said, "I gotta earn my own way."

I ain't never been in trouble
I ain't got the time
I don't mess around with magic, child
What I got is mine
Whatever you say, lord, well, that's what I'm gonna do
Whatever you say, well, that's what I'm gonna do
Cause I'm the working man, lord, and I do the job for you

I ain't never been in trouble
I ain't got the time
I don't mess around with magic, child
What I got is mine

Every friday, well, that's when I get paid
Don't take me on friday, lord, cause that's when I get paid
Let me die on saturday night, ooh, before sunday gets my headYou might also likeEmbed
