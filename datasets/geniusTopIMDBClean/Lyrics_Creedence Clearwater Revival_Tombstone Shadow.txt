Tombstone shadow stretching across my path
Tombstone shadow stretching across my path
Every time I get some good news Ooh
Theres a shadow on my back
Saw the gypsy man way down in San Berdoo
Said I saw the gypsy man way down in San Berdoo
Five dollars on the table Ooh
Keep me way from my tomb
Oh Oh
Said I got thirteen months of bad luck
Bound to be some pain
Dont you do no traveling
Fly in no machines
Tombstone shadow stretching across my path
Every time I get some good news Ooh
Theres a shadow on my back
The man gave me a luck charm Cost five dollars more
Said Put some on your pillow
And put some on your door
He said Take a long vacation Ooh
For thirteen months or more
Oh Lord
Tombstone shadow stretching across my path
Tombstone shadow stretching across my path
Every time I get some good news Ooh
Theres a shadow on my back
Oh oh Lord
Oh Lord
