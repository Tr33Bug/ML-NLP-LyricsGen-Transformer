Theres a place up ahead and Im goin
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away come away if youre goin
Leave the sinkin ship behind
Come on the risin wind
Were goin up around the bend
Oooh
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettings good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood
Come on the risin wind
Were goin up around the bend
Oooh
You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
Theres an ear for what you say
Come on the risin wind
Were goin up around the bend
Yeah
Oooh
Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And well meet by the big red tree
Theres a place up ahead and Im goin
Come along come along with me


Come on the risin wind
Were goin up around the bend
Yeah
Doo doo doodoo
Doo doo doodoo ooh
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doodoo yeah
Doo doo doodoo
Doo doo doo doo all right
