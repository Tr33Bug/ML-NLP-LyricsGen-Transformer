Late last night I went for a walk
Down by the river near my home
Couldnt believe with my own eyes
And I swear Ill never leave my home again
I saw a man walking on the water
Coming right at me from the other side
Calling out my name do not be afraid
Feet begin to run pounding in my brain
I dont want to go I dont want to go
No no no no no
I dont want to go
Mmmmmmm
