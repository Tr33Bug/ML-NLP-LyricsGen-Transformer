Long as I remember the rain been coming down
Clouds of mystery pouring confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages trying to find the sun
And I wonder still I wonder
Wholl stop the rain
I went down Virginia seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder still I wonder
Wholl stop the rain
Heard the singers playing how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring falling on my ears
And I wonder still I wonder
Wholl stop the rain
