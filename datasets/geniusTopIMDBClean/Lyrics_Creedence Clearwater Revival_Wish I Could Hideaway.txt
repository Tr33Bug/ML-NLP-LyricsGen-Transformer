Wish I Could  Hideaway Lyrics
Howdy friend begging your pardon
Is there something on your mind
Youve gone and sold all your belongings
Is that something in your eye
Well I know you really never
Liked the way it all goes down
Go on Hideaway
Whats that you say
Were all bound for the graveyard
Oooh I wish you well
Think its going to rain
Oh whats the difference
Is there some way I can help
Because you know Im going to miss you
When youre gone oh Lord
Wish I Could Hideaway
Hold on give yourself a chance
I can hear the leaving train
All aboard Goodbye goodbye goodbye
Oooh I wish you well
See you soon maybe tomorrow
You can never tell
Because you know Im going to miss you
When youre gone oh
Wish I could Hideaway
Hideaway
