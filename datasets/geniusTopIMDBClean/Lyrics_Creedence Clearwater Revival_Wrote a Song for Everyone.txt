Met myself a coming county welfare line
I was feeling strung out Hung out on the line
Saw myself a going down to war in June
All I want all I want is to write myself a tune
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldnt even talk to you
Got myself arrested Wound me up in jail
Richmond bout to blow up communication failed
If you see the answer nows the time to say
All I want all I want is to get you down to pray
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldnt even talk to you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldnt even talk to you
Saw the people standing thousand years in chains
Somebody said its different now look its just the same
Pharaohs spin the message round and round the truth
They could have saved a million people how can I tell you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldnt even talk to you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldnt even talk to you
Wrote a song for everyone
Wrote a song for truth
Wrote a song for everyone
And I couldnt even talk to you
