Dream beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find your song
Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes and rise
Higher still
Endless thrill
To the land of love
Beyond love
Come alive
Angel eye
Forever watching you and I
You are the night you are the ocean
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed
Theres no such thing as competition
To find our way we lose control
Remember loves our only mission
This is a journey of the soul
The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your homes a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams
