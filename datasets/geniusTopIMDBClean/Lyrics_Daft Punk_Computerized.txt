She says Im cold
Only time Im comfortable kissing is sending X and Os
I send a message back to dispute this fact but this I know
I hope to find my love like we used to before dialup
Whatever happened to our phone sex
Right now cant think of anything we dont text
I broke her heart on the email
Im so cold Ima just spare yall the details
I cant even tell yall whats real
I got an iTouch but I cant feel

Past was the word now Im living in the future
Start mackin on my black berry
She got jealous I was tappin on my Blackberry
So she didnt keep in touch
And I cant tell the difference
We aint see each other much
Aside from some late night texts
A couple Os a few Xs
My current feels just like my exes
Different characters same letters
Red light another message
Spilling her heart out what a mess this is
PS this is BS I cant even spell it out
Am I that unaffectionate

Somebody tell me whats real
I dont know how I feel
Somebody tell me whats real
I dont know how I feel
Somebody tell me whats real
I dont know how I feel
Somebody tell me whats real
I dont know how I feel
Somebody tell me whats real
Past was the word now Im living in the future
She said it got better and worser
And its supposed to be viceversa
I dont know I kinda like this surf stuff
We used to see tears when we hurt stuff
I guess it got faster but colder
We iChat thats how she comes over
Thats better than not seeing her
And Im so glad Im serving her like Serena
She can YouTube in the arena
And we close no matter how many miles between us
I told her Welcome to the future
Thats just how it is Im a user
