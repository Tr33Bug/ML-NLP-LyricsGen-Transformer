Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream Im dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling Ive waited so long
Dont stop come a little closer
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger
Theres nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long
The time is right to put my arms around you
Youre feeling right you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it this dream was all gone
Ooh I dont know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true
Ooh I dont know what to do
About this dream and you
Well make this dream come true
Why dont you play the game
Why dont you play the game
