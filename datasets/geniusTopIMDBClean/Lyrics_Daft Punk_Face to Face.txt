Whats going on Could this be my understanding
Its not your fault I was being too demanding
I must admit its my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that youd be someone different
Theres not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
Its amazing what youll find face to face
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are

I turned away because I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I realised you werent wrong it was a mere illusion
It really didnt make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
Its not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are
Dancing
You are

It really didnt make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
Its not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face
