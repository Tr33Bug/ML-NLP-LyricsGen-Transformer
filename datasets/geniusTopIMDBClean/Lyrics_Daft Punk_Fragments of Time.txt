Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And its crystal clear that I dont ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I cant stay
Ill just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Ill just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Familiar faces Ive never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like Im seventeen
And its crystal clear that I dont ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I cant stay
Ill just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Ill just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Ill just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Ill just keep playing back
These fragments of time
These moments will shine
