Fragments of Time Lyrics
Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine


I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go
These moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
These moments will shineYou might also like12Embed
