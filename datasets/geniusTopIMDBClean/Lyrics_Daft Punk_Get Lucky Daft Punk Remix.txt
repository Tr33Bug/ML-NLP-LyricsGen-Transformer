Get Lucky  Daft Punk Remix  Lyrics
Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning
Weve come too far
To give up who we are
So lets raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
Shes up all night to the sun Im up all night to get some
Shes up all night for good fun Im up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to the sun were up all night to get some
Were up all night for good fun were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky were up all night to get lucky
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this Im feeling
If you want to leave Im with it
Weve come too far
To give up who we are
So lets raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
Shes up all night to the sun Im up all night to get some
Shes up all night for good fun Im up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to the sun were up all night to get some
Were up all night for good fun were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Weve come too far
To give up who we are
So lets raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
Shes up all night to the sun Im up all night to get some
Shes up all night for good fun Im up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to the sun were up all night to get some
Were up all night for good fun were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
