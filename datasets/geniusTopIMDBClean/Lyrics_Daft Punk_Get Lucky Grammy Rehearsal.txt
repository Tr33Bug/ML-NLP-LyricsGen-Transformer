Get Lucky  Grammy Rehearsal  Lyrics
Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning
Weve come too far to give up who we are
So lets raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
Shes up all night to the sun
Im up all night to get some
Shes up all night for good fun
Im up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to the sun
Were up all night to get some
Were up all night for good fun
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky  x4 
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this Im feeling
If you wanna leave Im with it
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky

Were up all night to get harder
Were up all night to get better
Were up all night to get faster
Come on come on come on come on 
Were up all night to get stronger
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Ahh freak out
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Freak out
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Freak out
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Freak out
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Freak out
Were up all night to get lucky
Were up all night to get lucky
Freak out
Harder better faster stronger
Freak out
More than ever hour after our work is never over
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
For you
There might be a brighter star
But in my eyes
The light of you is all I see
unfinished
