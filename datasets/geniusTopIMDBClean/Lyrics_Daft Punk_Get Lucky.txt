Like the legend of the phoenix huh
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning uhhuh
The force from the beginning
Look
Weve come too far
To give up who we are
So lets raise the bar
And our cups to the stars
Shes up all night til the sun
Im up all night to get some
Shes up all night for good fun

If you wanna leave Im with it uhhuh
