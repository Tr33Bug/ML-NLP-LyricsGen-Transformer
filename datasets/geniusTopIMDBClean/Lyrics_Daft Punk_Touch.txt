Touch touch
I remember touch
Touch touch
I remember touch
Where do I belong
Touch I need something more
I remember touch
I need something more in my mind
Touch I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see
A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A halfforgotten song
Where do I belong
Tell me what you see
I need something more
Kiss suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin
A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch where do you lead
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more
Home hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre home
Hold on if love is the answer youre
Touch sweet touch
Youve given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
Youve almost convinced me Im real
I need something more
I need something more
