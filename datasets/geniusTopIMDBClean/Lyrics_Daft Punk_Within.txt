There are so many things that I dont understand
Theres a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore but the doors look the same
I am lost I cant even remember my name
Ive been for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Ive been for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am

Many rooms to explore but the doors look the same
Where are the locks to try the key 
I am lost I cant even remember my name
And I wonder why 
Ive been for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Ive been for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Ive been for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
Ive been for some time
Looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
