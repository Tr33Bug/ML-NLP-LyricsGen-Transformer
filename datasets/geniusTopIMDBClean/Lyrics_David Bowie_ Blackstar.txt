Blackstar  Lyrics
In the villa of Ormen in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle ahah ahah
In the centre of it all in the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile ahah ahah
At the centre of it all at the centre of it all
Your eyes your eyes
Ahahah
Ahahah
In the villa of Ormen in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle ahah ahah
At the centre of it all at the centre of it all
Your eyes your eyes
Ahahah
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place and bravely cried
Im a blackstar Im a blackstar 
How many times does an angel fall
How many people lie instead of talking tall
He trod on sacred ground he cried loud into the crowd
Im a blackstar Im a blackstar Im not a gangstar 
I cant answer why  Im a blackstar 
Just go with me  Im not a filmstar 
Ima take you home  Im a blackstar 
Take your passport and shoes  Im not a popstar 
And your sedatives boo  Im a blackstar 
Youre a flash in the pan  Im not a marvel star 
Im the Great I Am  Im a blackstar 
Im a blackstar way up on money Ive got game
I see right so wide so openhearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams diamonds in my eyes
Im a blackstar Im a blackstar 
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place and bravely cried
Im a blackstar Im a stars star Im a blackstar 
I cant answer why  Im not a gangstar 
But I can tell you how  Im not a flam star 
We were born upsidedown  Im a stars star 
Born the wrong way round  Im not a white star 
Im a blackstar Im not a gangstar
Im a blackstar Im a blackstar
Im not a pornstar Im not a wandering star
Im a blackstar Im a blackstar


In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle
Ahah ahah
At the centre of it all your eyes
On the day of execution only women kneel and smile
Ahah ahah
At the centre of it all your eyes your eyes
Ahahah
