Andy Warhol Lyrics
This is "Andy Warhol"—
Yes it is, 
—and it's take one, now we do take one
It's— it's Warhol, actually
What did I say?
Hol, it's Hol as in holes
Andy Warh-
Huh? Andy Warho-
Andy War-War-ol, like hol—hol—
"Andy Warhol" take one
Ha
Are you ready?
Yeah, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
You might also like
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all4Embed
