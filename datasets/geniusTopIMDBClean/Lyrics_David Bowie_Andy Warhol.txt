Ha
Are you ready
Yeah ahhahahahaha
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
Id like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol Silver Screen
Cant tell them apart at all
Andy walking Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when hes fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
Hell think about paint
And hell think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do


Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol Silver Screen
Cant tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol Silver Screen
Cant tell them apart at all
