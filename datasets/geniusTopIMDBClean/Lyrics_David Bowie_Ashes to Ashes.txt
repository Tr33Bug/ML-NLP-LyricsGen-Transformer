Do you remember a guy thats been
In such an early song
Ive heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no dont say its true
They got a message from the Action Man
Im happy hope youre happy too
Ive loved all Ive needed to love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I aint got no money and I aint got no hair
But Im hoping to kick but the planet is glowing
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an alltime low
Time and again I tell myself
Ill stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
Im stuck with a valuable friend
Im happy hope youre happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
Ive never done good things
Ive never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue whoa whoa
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an alltime low


My mama said to get things done
Youd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
Youd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
Youd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
Youd better not mess with Major Tom
