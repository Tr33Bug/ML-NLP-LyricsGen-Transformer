Cat People  Putting Out Fire  Lyrics
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Its been so long
Feel my blood enraged
Its just the fear of losing you
Dont you know my name
And youve been so long
And Ive been putting out fire
With gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
Its been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Youve been so long
And its been so long
And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Youve been so long
Well its been so long


And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline
Been so long 
Been so long  and its been so long
Been so long  Ive been putting out fire
Been so long  its been so long
Been so long  been putting out fire
Been so long  its been so long
Been so long  putting out fire
Been so long 
Been so long  so long so long 
Been so long  so long so long 
Been putting out fire  been so long so long so long 
Been putting out fire  been so long so long so long 
Been so long
Been so long so long so long 
Been so long so long so long 
Been putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Been so long
Been so long
And Ive been putting out fire
Ive been putting out fire
