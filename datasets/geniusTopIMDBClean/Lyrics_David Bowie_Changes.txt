Oh yeah
Mmm
Still dont know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild a million deadend streets and
Every time I thought Id got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But Ive never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
Im much too fast to take that test
Chchchchchanges  Turn and face the strange 
Chchchanges dont want to be a richer man
Chchchchchanges  Turn and face the strange 
Chchchanges just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I cant trace time
Oh yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
Theyre quite aware of what theyre going through
Chchchchchanges  Turn and face the strange 
Chchchanges dont tell them to grow up and out of it
Chchchchchanges  Turn and face the strange 
Chchchanges wheres your shame
Youve left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you cant trace time
Strange fascination fascinating me
Ah changes are taking the pace Im going through
Chchchchchanges  turn and face the strange 
Chchchanges oh look out you rock n rollers
Chchchchchanges  turn and face the strange 
Chchchanges pretty soon now youre gonna get older
Time may change me
But I cant trace time
I said that time may change me
But I cant trace time
