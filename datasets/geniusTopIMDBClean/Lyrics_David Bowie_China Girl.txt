Ohohohoh little China Girl
Ohohohoh little China Girl
I could escape this feeling with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw the stars crashing
Im a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the mornings wheres my little China Girl
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down
Im feeling tragic like Im Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head plans for everyone
Its in the white of my eyes
My little china girl
You shouldnt mess with me
Ill ruin everything you are
You know Ill give you television
Ill give you eyes of blue
Ill give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says shh
She says shh
She says
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says shh
She says
Ohohohoh little China Girl
Ohohohoh little China Girl
Ohohohoh little China Girl
Ohohohoh little China Girl
