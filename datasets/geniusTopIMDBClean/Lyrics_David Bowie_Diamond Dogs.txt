This aint rock n roll this is genocide
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Brownings Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
Im sure youre not protected for its plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come  Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come  Oh baby come on to me
Will they come  Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below oh Tarzan go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed Diamond Dogs are stabilised
Will they come  Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come  Oh baby come on to me
Will they come  Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs


Ooooooh  call them the Diamond Dogs
Ooooooh  call them the Diamond Dogs
Oh hoo
Ah ooh
In the year of the scavenger the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk scurry to the ditch
Just another future song lonely little kitsch
Theres gonna be sorrow  try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come  Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come  Oh baby come on to me
Will they come  Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Ooooooh call them the Diamond Dogs
Ooooooh call them the Diamond Dogs
Bowwow woof woof bowwow wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs call them they call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs call them call them ooh hoo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool Diamond Dogs rule OK
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs 
Beware of the Diamond Dogs 
Beware of the Diamond Dogs 
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
