Cash girls suffer me Ive got no enemies
Im walking down
Its nothing to me
Its nothing to see
If Ill never see the English evergreens Im running to
Its nothing to me
Its nothing to see
Im dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
Im trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those oligarchs with foaming mouths come
Now and then
Cant believe for just one second Im forgetting you
Im trying to
Im dying to
Dollar days survival sex
Honour stretching tails to necks
Im falling down
Its nothing to me
Its nothing to see
If Ill never see the English evergreens Im running to
Its nothing to me
Its nothing to see
Im dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
Im trying to
Its all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
Im falling down
Dont believe for just one second Im forgetting you
Im trying to
Im dying to
Im trying to
Im dying to
Im trying to
Im dying to
Im trying to
Im dying to
Im trying to
Im dying to
