Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing  Sighing 
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in  Cry in 
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying  Dying 
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying  Lying 
I heard telephones opera house favourite melodies
I saw boys toys electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat skinny people
And all the tall short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought Id need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadnt have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an icecream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Dont think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you youre beautiful
I want you to walk
Weve got five years stuck on my eyes
Five years what a surprise
Weve got five years my brain hurts a lot
Five years thats all weve got
Weve got five years what a surprise
Five years stuck on my eyes
Weve got five years my brain hurts a lot
Five years thats all weve got
Weve got five years stuck on my eyes
Five years what a surprise
Weve got five years my brain hurts a lot
Five years thats all weve got
Weve got five years what a surprise
Weve got five years stuck on my eyes
Weve got five years my brain hurts a lot
Five years thats all weve got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years
