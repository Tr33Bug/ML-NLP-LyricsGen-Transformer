Golden years gold whop whop whop
Golden years gold whop whop whop

Lifes taking you nowhere angel
Come get up my baby 
Look at that sky lifes begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby 
Theres my baby lost thats all
Once Im begging you save her little soul
Golden years gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings angel
Come get up my baby 
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back walk tall act fine
Come get up my baby 
Ill stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothings gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Some of these days and it wont be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
Come get up my baby 
Dont cry my sweet dont break my heart
Doing all right but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day
I believe oh Lord I believe all the way
Come get up my baby 
Run for the shadows run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
Theres my baby lost thats all
Once Im begging you save her little soul
Golden years gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Dont let me hear you say lifes taking you nowhere angel
Come get up my baby 
Run for the shadows run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
Ill stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothings gonna touch you in these golden years
