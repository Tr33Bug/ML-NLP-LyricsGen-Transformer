One two 
Well shes a tonguetwisting storm
Shell come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
Shes a funkythigh collector
Laying on electric dreams
Well come on come on
Weve really got a good thing going
Well come on well come on
If you think were gonna make it you better hang on to yourself
We cant dance we dont talk much we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
Youre the Blessed were The Spiders From Mars
Well come on come on
Weve really got a good thing going
Well come on well come on
If you think were gonna make it you better hang on to yourself
Come on
Lay it on
Come on come on
Weve really got a good thing going
Well come on well come on
If you think were gonna make it you better hang on to yourself


Well come on come on
Weve really got a good thing going
Well come on well come on
If you think were gonna make it you better hang on to yourself
Come on ah come on ah come on ah come on ah
Come on ah come on ah come on ah come on ah
Come on ah come on ah come on ah come on ah
Come on ah come on ah come on ah come on ah
