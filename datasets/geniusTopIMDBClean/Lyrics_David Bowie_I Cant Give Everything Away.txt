I know somethings very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I cant give everything
I cant give everything away
I cant give everything away
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
Thats the message that I sent
I cant give everything
I cant give everything away
I cant give everything away
I cant give everything
I cant give everything away
I cant give everything away
I know somethings very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes
I cant give everything
I cant give everything away
I cant give everything away
I cant give everything
I cant give everything away
I cant give everything away
