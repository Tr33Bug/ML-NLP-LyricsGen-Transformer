When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
Well all the people have got their problems
That aint nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes itll take you right up and sometimes down again
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
Satisfaction satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
Ive got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
Shes acalling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants
You can give her something too
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
