Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint wont dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow and a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
Cause if you stay with us youre going to be pretty kooky too
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Dont pick fights with the bullies or the cads
Cause Im not much cop at punching other peoples dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then well throw it on the fire and take the car downtown
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of kooks hung up on romancing
