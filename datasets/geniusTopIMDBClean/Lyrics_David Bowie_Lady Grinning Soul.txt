Shell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne shell wear
Silver and Americard
Shell drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
Shell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
But she wont stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
