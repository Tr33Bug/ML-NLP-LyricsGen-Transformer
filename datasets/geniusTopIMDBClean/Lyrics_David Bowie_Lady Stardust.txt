People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright
The band was all together
Yes he was alright
The song went on forever
Yes he was awful nice
Really quite outta sight
And he sang all night long
Femme fatales emerged from shadows to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs of darkness and dismay
And he was alright
The band was all together
Yes he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise and he sang
All night all night long
Ooh how I sighed
When they asked if I knew his name
Oh it was alright
The band was all together
Yes he was alright
And the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise he sang
All night long

 Get some pussy now
