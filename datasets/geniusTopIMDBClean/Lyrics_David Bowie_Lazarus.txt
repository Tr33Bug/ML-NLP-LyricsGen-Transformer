Look up here Im in heaven
Ive got scars that cant be seen
Ive got drama cant be stolen
Everybody knows me now
Look up here man Im in danger
Ive got nothing left to lose
Im so high it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Aint that just like me
By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass
This way or no way
You know Ill be free
Just like that bluebird
Now aint that just like me
Oh Ill be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh Ill be free
Aint that just like me
