Ah ah ah ah
Lets dance 
Lets dance 
Lets dance  put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Lets dance  to the song theyre playing on the radio
Lets sway  while colour lights up your face
Lets sway  sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run Ill run with you
And if you say hide well hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower
Lets dance 
Lets dance 
Lets dance  for fear your grace should fall
Lets dance  for fear tonight is all
Lets sway  you could look into my eyes
Lets sway  under the moonlight this serious moonlight
And if you say run Ill run with you
And if you say hide well hide
Because my love for you would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms and tremble like a flower
Lets dance 
Lets dance 


Lets dance  put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Lets dance  to the song were playing
Lets sway 
Lets sway  under the moonlight this serious moonlight
Lets dance 
Lets 
Lets 
Lets 
Lets sway 
Lets 
Lets dance lets dance lets dance lets dance lets dance
Lets dance 
Lets sway
Lets sway
Lets dance lets dance lets dance lets dance lets dance
Lets dance
