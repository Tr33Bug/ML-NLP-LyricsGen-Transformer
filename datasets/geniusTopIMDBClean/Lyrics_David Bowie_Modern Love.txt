I know when to go out
Know when to stay in
Get things done
I catch the paper boy
But things dont really change
Im standing in the wind
But I never wave byebye
But I try
I try
Theres no sign of life
Its just the power to charm
Im lying in the rain
But I never wave byebye
But I try
I try
Never going to fall for
Modern love  Walks beside me
Modern love  Walks on by
Modern love  Gets me to the church on time
Church on time  Terrifies me
Church on time  Makes me party
Church on time  Puts my trust in God and man
God and man  No confessions
God and man  No religion
God and man  Dont believe in modern love
Its not really work
Its just the power to charm
Still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye
But I try
I try


Never going to fall for
Modern love  Walks beside me
Modern love  Walks on by
Modern love  Gets me to the church on time
Church on time  Terrifies me
Church on time  Makes me party
Church on time  Puts my trust in God and man
God and man  No confessions
God and man  No religion
God and man  Dont believe in modern love
Modern love  Walks beside me
Modern love  Walks on by
Modern love  Gets me to the church on time
Church on time  Terrifies me
Church on time  Makes me party
Church on time  Puts my trust in God and man
God and man  No confessions
God and man  No religion
God and man  Dont believe in modern love
Modern love modern love modern love modern love
Modern love modern love modern love modern love
Modern love modern love modern love modern love 
Modern love walks beside me  Modern love 
Modern love walks on by  Modern love 
Modern love walks beside me  Modern love 
Modern love walks on by  Modern love 
Never gonna fall for
Modern love modern love modern love modern love
