Oh! You Pretty Things Lyrics
Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window, what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me

All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to?
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for

All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of the coming race
The Earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
You might also like
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Oh, you Pretty Things (Oh, you Pretty Things)
Don't you know you're driving your Mamas and Papas insane?
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior19Embed
