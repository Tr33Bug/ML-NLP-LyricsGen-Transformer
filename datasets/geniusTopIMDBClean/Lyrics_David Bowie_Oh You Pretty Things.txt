Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
Ive made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stay
Oh you Pretty Things  Oh you Pretty Things 
Dont you know youre driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things  Oh you Pretty Things 
Dont you know youre driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Dont kid yourself they belong to you
Theyre the start of the coming race
The Earth is a bitch weve finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stay
Oh you Pretty Things  Oh you Pretty Things 
Dont you know youre driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things  Oh you Pretty Things 
Dont you know youre driving your Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
Gotta make way for the Homo Superior
