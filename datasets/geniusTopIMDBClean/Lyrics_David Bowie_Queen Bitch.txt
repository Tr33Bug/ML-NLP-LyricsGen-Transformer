Im up on the eleventh floor
And Im watching the cruisers below
Hes down on the street
And hes trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh my hearts in the basement
My weekends at an all time low
Cause shes hoping to score
So I cant see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind
Oh not her
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bippertybopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
Oh yeah
Shes an oldtime ambassador
Of sweet talking night walking games
Oh and shes known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it
She dont make false claims
But shes a queen and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now shes leading him on
And shell lay him right down
Yes shes leading him on
And shell lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes it could have been me
Why didnt I say why didnt I say
No no no


Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bippertybopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It dont feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
And hes down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And Im phoning a cab
Cause my stomach feels small
Theres a taste in my mouth
And its no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah it could have been me
Why didnt I say why didnt I say
No no no
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bippertybopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
Ooh
You betcha
Oh yeah
Uhhuh
Mmm
