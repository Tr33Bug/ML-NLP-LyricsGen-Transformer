Im closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowleys uniform
Of imagery
Im living in a silent film
Portraying Himmlers sacred realm
Of dream reality
Im frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I aint got the power anymore
No I aint got the power anymore
Im the twisted name on Garbos eyes
Living proof of Churchills lies
Im destiny
Im torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry
Should I kiss the vipers fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
Im sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I aint got the power anymore
Dont believe in yourself
Dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Ah
Ah
Im not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
Im living on
Im tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Cant take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith


If I dont explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
Im sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I aint got the power anymore
Dont believe in yourself
Dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Ah
Ah
Dont believe in yourself
Dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Ah
Ah
