Time takes a cigarette puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger then another finger then cigarette
The walltowall is calling it lingers then you forget
Oh oh oh oh youre a rock n roll suicide
Youre too old to lose it too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you dont eat when youve lived too long
Oh no no no youre a rock n roll suicide
Chevy brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Dont let the sun blast your shadow
Dont let the milk float ride your mind
Youre so natural religiously unkind
Oh no love youre not alone
Youre watching yourself but youre too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care
Oh no love youre not alone
No matter what or who youve been
No matter when or where youve seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
Ive had my share Ill help you with the pain
Youre not alone
Just turn on with me and youre not alone
Lets turn on and be not alone  Wonderful 
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful  Wonderful 
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful  Wonderful 
Oh gimme your hands
