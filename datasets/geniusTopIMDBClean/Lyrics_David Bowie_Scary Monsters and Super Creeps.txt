Scary Monsters  and Super Creeps  Lyrics
She had an horror of rooms she was tired you cant hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
Well she couldve been a killer if she didnt walk the way she do
And she do
She opened strange doors that wed never close again
She began to wail jealousys scream
Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now shes stupid in the street and she cant socialise
Well I love the little girl and Ill love her till the day she dies
She wails Jimmys guitar sound jealousys scream
Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running running scared


Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keep me running running scared
