Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Doodoodoodoo doodoodoodoo doodoodoo 
Dont you wonder sometimes
Bout sound and vision
Blue blue lectric blue
Thats the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read nothing to say
Blue blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head
Dont you wonder sometimes
Bout sound and vision
