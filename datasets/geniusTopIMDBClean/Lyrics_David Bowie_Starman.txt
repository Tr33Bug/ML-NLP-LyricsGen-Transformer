Hey now now
Goodbye love
Didnt know what time it was the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock n roll
Lotta soul he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That werent no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive
Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hed like to come and meet us
But he thinks hed blow our minds
Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows its all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey thats far out so you heard him too
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Dont tell your poppa or hell get us locked up in fright
Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hed like to come and meet us
But he thinks hed blow our minds
Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows its all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie


Starman waiting in the sky
Hed like to come and meet us
But he thinks hed blow our minds
Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows its all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
