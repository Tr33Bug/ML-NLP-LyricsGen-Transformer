The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
Here are we one magical moment
Such is the stuff from where dreams are woven
Bending sound dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you drive like a demon
From station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love
Wonder who wonder who wonder when
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink drink drain your glass raise your glass high
Its not the sideeffects of the cocaine
Im thinking that it must be love
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European canon is near
I must be only one in a million
I wont let the day pass without her
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
Should I believe that Ive been stricken
Does my face show some kind of glow
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European canon is here yes its here
Its too late Its too late
Its too late Its too late
Its too late
The European canon is near
Its not the sideeffects of the cocaine
Im thinking that it must be love
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
I must be only one in a million
I wont let the day pass without her
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European canon is here yes its here
Should I believe that Ive been stricken
Does my face show some kind of glow
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European canon is here yes its here
Its too late Its too late
Its too late Its too late
Its too late
The European canon is here
