Sue  Or in a Season of Crime  Lyrics
Sue
I got the job
Well buy the house
Youll need to rest
But now well make it
Sue
The clinic called
The xrays fine
I brought you home
I just said home
Sue you said you want it writ
Sue the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words
For I know that you have a son
Oh folly Sue
Ride the train Im far from home
In a season of crime none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue Ive pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face
I touched your face
Sue goodbye
Sue I found your note
That you wrote last night
It cant be right
You went with him
Sue I never dreamed
Im such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown
