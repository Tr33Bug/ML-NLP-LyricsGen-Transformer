Suffragette City Lyrics
(Hey man) Oh, leave me alone, you know
(Hey man) Oh, Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) My schooldays insane
(Hey man) My work's down the drain
(Hey man) Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
(Hey, man) Oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
(Hey, man) I can't take you this time, no way
(Hey, man) Dear droogie, don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right
Oh, hit me

Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
And don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Whoa, she's all right
