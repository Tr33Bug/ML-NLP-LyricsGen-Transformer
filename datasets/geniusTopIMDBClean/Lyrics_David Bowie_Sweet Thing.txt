Its safe in the city
To love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isnt it me
Putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash
Will you see that Im scared and Im lonely
So Ill break up my room and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it boys get it here thing
For hope boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Im glad that youre older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile isnt that me
Im in your way and Ill steal every moment
If this trade is a curse then Ill bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburgers and
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it boys get it here thing
For hope boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
