And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like the hope it was
And the goodmen tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicely shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing they swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was stone and he was wax
So he could scream and still relax unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and lo It was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
And the Devil may be here
But he cant sing about that
Oh and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers
Now the dress is hung the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead he could be not he could be you
Hes chameleon comedian Corinthian and caricature
Shooting up pieinthesky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutchhungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh and we were gone
Kings of oblivion
We were so turned on
In the mindwarp pavilion
Lay me place and bake me pie
Im starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes and door unlocked
I might just slip away hey
Just for the day  hey  hey
Please come away hey
Just for the day hey
Please come away hey
Please come away
Just for the day
Please come away
Please come away
Please come away
Please come away
Away
Away
