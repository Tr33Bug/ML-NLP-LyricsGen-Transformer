A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers
And ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New Yorks a gogo and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie
Woohoo
Get back one 
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
The Jean Genie  hes outrageous he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie let yourself go oh
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him she loves him but just for a short while
Shell scratch in the sand wont let go his hand
He says hes a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
The Jean Genie  hes outrageous he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie let yourself go whoaoh
Hes so simple minded he cant drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved
Woohoo
Woohoo
Oh the Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
The Jean Genie  hes outrageous he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie let yourself go oh
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
The Jean Genie  hes outrageous he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie let yourself go oh
Go
Go go
