Translations
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasnt there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no not me
I never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago
Who knows Not me
We never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows Not me
We never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the world
