Time  Hes waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me Boy
Time  He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me Boy
Time  In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain
Regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Well I look at my watch it says 925 and I think
Oh God Im still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
Li li li li li li li li li li

You  Are not a victim
You  Just scream with boredom
You  Are not evicting time
Chimes  Goddamn youre looking old
Youll freeze and catch a cold
Cause youve left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard
But keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind
But love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real and dreamless
Perhaps youre smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I have to give
Is guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
