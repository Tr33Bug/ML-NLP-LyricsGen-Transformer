Valentine told me whos to go
Feelings hes treasured most of all
The teachers and the football star
Its in his tiny face
Its in his scrawny hand
Valentine told me so
Hes got something to say its Valentines Day
The rhythm of the crowd
Teddy and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
Hes got something to say its Valentines Day
Valentine told me how it feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall
Its in his tiny face
Its in his scrawny hand
Valentine knows it all
Hes got something to say its Valentines Day
Yeah 
Valentine Valentine
Yeah   Woo   Woo 
Valentine Valentine
Its in his scrawny hand
Its in his icy heart
Its happening today
Valentine Valentine
Its in his scrawny hands
Its in his icy heart
Its happening today
Valentine Valentine
