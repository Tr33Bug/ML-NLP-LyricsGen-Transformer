They pulled in just behind the fridge
He lays her down he frowns
Gee my lifes a funny thing
Am I still too young
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring took his babies
It took him minutes took her nowhere
Heaven knows shed have taken anything but
All night 
She wants the young American
Young American young American 
She wants the young American 
All right 
She wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid shell take anything
But the freak and his type all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand but
Showing nothing he swoops like a song
She cries Where have all Papas heroes gone
All night 
She wants the young American
Young American young American 
She wants the young American 
All right 
But she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more
All night
He wants the young American
Young American young American 
He wants the young American 
All right  All right
He wants the young American


Do you remember your President Nixon
Do you remember the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday
Have you been the unAmerican
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
bout Leather leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well well well would you carry a razor
In case just in case of depression
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the AfroSheeners
Aint that close to love
Well aint that poster love
Well it aint that Barbie doll
Her hearts been broken just like you and
All night 
All night you want the young American
Young American  young American
You want the young American  All right
All right
You want the young American
You aint a pimp and you aint a hustler
A pimps got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Blacks got respect and whites got his soul train
Mamas got cramps and look at your hands ache
I heard the news today oh boy 
I got a suite and you got defeat
Aint there a man who can say no more
And aint there a woman I can sock on the jaw
And aint there a child I can hold without judging
Aint there a pen that will write before they die
Aint you proud that youve still got faces
Aint there one damn song that can make me break down and cry
All night
I want the young American
Young American  young American
I want the young American 
All right
I want the young American young American
Young American young American 
I want the young American 
All night 
You want I I want you
Young American young American 
I want the young American 
All right 
All I want is the young American
Young American young American 
I want the young American 
All night
