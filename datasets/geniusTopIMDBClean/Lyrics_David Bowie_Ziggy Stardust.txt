Oh yeah
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders From Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggys band
Ziggy really sang
Screwedup eyes and screweddown hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick em by smiling
He could leave em to hang
He came on so loaded man
Well hung and snowwhite tan
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands
Oh yeah
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With Godgiven ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind  ah 
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band
Oh yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar
