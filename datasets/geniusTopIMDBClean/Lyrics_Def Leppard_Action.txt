So you think youll take another piece of me
To satisfy your intellectual need
Do you want do you want
Action action action action
Gonna bring you down
Cause youve been pushing me
Youve got to recognize my superiority
Liar liar liar liar
You know you believed it
Higher higher higher higher
Cause Im the main man
And thats why everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
Ive got what everybody needs satisfaction guarantees
That everybody wants a piece of the action
Oh I was suicidal cause you was my idol
Baby baby baby bring it to your knees
Oh there was a time I would have walked the line
But you bled me dry with your insatiable greed
Liar liar liar liar
You know you believed it
Higher higher higher higher
Cause Im the main man
And thats why everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
Ive got what everybody needs satisfaction guarantees
That everybody wants a piece of the action
Do you want do you want action
Everybody wants everybody needs
Everybody wants everybody needs
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
Ive got what everybody needs satisfaction guarantees
That everybody wants a piece of the action action action
Action action action action
