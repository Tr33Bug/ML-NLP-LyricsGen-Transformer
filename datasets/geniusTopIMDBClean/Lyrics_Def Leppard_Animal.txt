A wild ride over stony ground
Such a lust for life the circus comes to town
We are the hungry ones on a lightning raid
Just like a river runs like a fire needs flame
Oh I burn for you
I got to feel it in my blood whoa oh
I need your touch dont need your love whoa oh
And I want and I need and I lust animal
And I want and I need and I lust animal
I cry wolf given mouth to mouth
Like a moving heartbeat in the witching hour
Im running with the wind a shadow in the dust
And like the driving rain hey like the restless rust
I never sleep
Huh Oh Cry wolf baby cry tough
Going to hunt you like an uh uh animal
Going to take your love and run
And I want  And I want 
And I need  And I need 
And I lust  And I lust 
Animal  Animal 
And I want  Take me 
And I need  Tame me 
And I lust  Make me 
Animal  Your Animal 

And I want  Show me 
And I need  Stroke me 
And I lust  Let me be your 
Animal  Animal 
And I want  I want 
And I need  Ooh ooh ooh 
And I lust
Animal  Animal
