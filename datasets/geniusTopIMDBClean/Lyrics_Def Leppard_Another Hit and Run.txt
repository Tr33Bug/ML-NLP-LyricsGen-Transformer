Union Jack is back with a hole in his head
Hes getting badly burned every time
Hes laughing at me and dancing on my sneakers
And his sixties songs are blowing up my speakers
I say You got no respect
Respect for authority
Youre just playing your dirty tricks
And then come crying to me
Hit and run
Hit and run
Its just a hit and run
Another hit and run
The bulldog lost his bite and his breath has gone bad
And the whole damn world is really laughing mad
I say You got no respect
Respect for authority
Youre just playing your dirty tricks
And then come crying to me
Hit and run
Hit and run
Its just a hit and run
Another hit and run
Hit it oh yeah
Oh bring it down
Oh you bring it down


I said you aint got no respect
I said you aint got no respect
No you aint got no respect
And you hit me when Im down
Hit and run
Hit and run
Its just a hit and run
I said its just another hit and run
Oh yeah hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run
Its just another hit and run
Hit and run
