Billys got a gun hes on the run
Confusion in his mind the blind leads the blind
Yeah Billys got a gun hes going to shoot you down
Hes got evil in his eyes got a reason to despise
Theres danger in the air
Can you feel it in the air
Theres danger in the air 
Danger
Such a strange emotion 
Can you feel it in the air
Oh yeah 
Oh he was locked inside a room without a door
His innocence he suffered for in a world of black and white
They were wrong and he was right
Just looking for a clue its a nightmare come true
Hes going underground to track that danger down
Oh Billy and why you got that gun
Can you feel it in the air
Theres danger in the air 
Danger
Such a strange emotion 
Can you feel it in the air
Oh yeah 
Never give him an even break
Getting caught is the chance you take
It could be your last mistake
You could be so hopeless 
As a bird with a broken wing
Like a sheep in a lions den
Going to fall but you wont know when
Hes going to get you 


You hear footsteps in the night see shadows on the wall
And the ghostly sound of silence as the mist begins to fall
Then a scream rang out like thunder but the lightning was too late
As the rain came down on the crimson ground was the hand of fate
And a crowd of people gathered around but Billy couldnt wait
Can you feel it in the air
Theres danger in the air 
Danger
Such a strange emotion 
Can you feel it in the air
Oh yeah 
Aah you better run  Never give him an even break
Better run  Getting caught is the chance you take
You better run  It could be your last mistake
Yeah Billys got a gun 
As a bird with a broken wing  Oh Billy 
As a sheep in the lions den  Oh Billy 
Going to fall but you wont know when
Yeah the heat is on hes going to get you 
Bang bang
