Gypsy sittin looking pretty
A broken rose with laughin eyes
Youre a mystery always runnin wild
Like a child without a home
Youre always searchin searchin for a feeling
But its easy come and easy go
Oh Im sorry but its true
Youre bringin on the heartache
Takin all the best of me oh cant you see
You got the best of me oh cant you see
Youre bringin on the heartbreak
Bringin on the heartache
Youre bringin on the heartbreak
Bringin on the heartache
Cant you see Oh
Youre such a secret misty eyed and shady
Lady how you hold the key
Oh youre like a candle your flame slowly fadin
Burnin out and burnin me cant you see
Just tryin to say to you
Youre bringin on the heartache
Takin all the best of me oh cant you see
You got the best of me oh cant you see
Youre bringin on the heartbreak
Bringin on the heartache
Youre bringin on the heartbreak
Bringin on the heartache
Cant you see cant you see
