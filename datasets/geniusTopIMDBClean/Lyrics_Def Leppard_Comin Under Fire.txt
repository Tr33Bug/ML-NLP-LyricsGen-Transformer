Your kind of woman gotta heart of stone
But watch it break when I get you alone
Take a chance come lay down with me
Oh I want to make it
Slow and steady never lost the race
Dont stop running Im a fool for the chase
Play the game surrender to me
Baby I dont want to fake it
Is it any wonder
You got me coming under fire
Coming like thunder
You know you make me walk the wire
Its so easy to put on a show
Your body says yes but you wont let it go
But my passion it wont slip away
Oh Im not going crazy
Under fire
You got me coming under fire
You got me coming under fire
Oh yeah Im coming under fire
You body says yes but baby please let it go
Let it go yeah yeah
You got me Im coming my back to the wall
No bed of roses aint no bed at all
Im walking the wire I stumble and fall
I got my message but I aint gonna crawl
Under fire
You got me coming under fire
You got me coming under fire
Oh yeah Im coming under fire
