Lets welcome home the soldier boy
Far away far away 
No angel of mercy just a need to destroy
Far away far away 
Lets toast the hero with blood in his eyes
The scars on his mind took so many lives
Die hard the hunter
Welcome home soldier boy
Put down your pistol yeah put down your toy
Yeah they can take the gun away from you
But never take away your attitude
They cant do that no no no they cant do that
You got no enemy no front line
The only battles in the back of your mind
You dont know how to change from bad to good
You brought the war to your neighborhood
You cant do that you cant do that
They cant do that no no no they cant do that
Die hard 
Youre caught in a trap
Hunter 
Theres no looking back
Die hard 
Hes lost in the crowd
Hunter 
Die hard and proud
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter


Back in the city hes a man on the loose
He is the shadow thats following you
He takes no prisoners when hes hunting for game
Hes got a bullet and it carries your name
You cant do that you cant do that you cant do that
Die hard 
Youre caught in a trap
Hunter 
Theres no looking back
Die hard 
Hes lost in the crowd
Hunter 
Die hard and proud
Die hard 
Youre caught in a trap
Hunter 
Theres no looking back
Die hard 
Hes lost in the crowd
Hunter 
Die hard and proud
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
Die hard the hunter
You cant do that
You cant do that no no no
