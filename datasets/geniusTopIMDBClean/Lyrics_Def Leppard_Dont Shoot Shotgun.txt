Run for cover
Dont shoot Shoot
Shes so dangerous
Shotgun gun
Dont shoot shotgun
Maybe Im wrong maybe Im right
Falling head over heals at the speed of light
Hey little Miss Heaven on earth
Whoa wont you walk this way but I see a red alert
Oh my senses say keep away so dont shoot
Dont shoot shotgun dream on nightmare
Touch and go dove turned destroyer
She cut you up shes a slave of love
Run for cover shes so dangerous
Undercover shes so shameless
Dont shoot shotgun
You got me biting my lip
Dont shoot shotgun
You shooting straight from the hip
So dont shoot shotgun
Shoot me baby
Hit and miss flesh and blood
Shes sweet and indiscreet she cant get enough
A little midnight madness oh baby you cant hide
So wild and unpredictable step aside
Because youre youre shooting wide
Run for cover shes so dangerous
Undercover shes so shameless
Dont shoot shotgun
You got me biting my lip
Dont shoot shotgun
You shooting straight from the hip
Oh shake it shake it
Ah take this little hit and miss
Dont shoot shotgun
You got me biting my lip
Dont shoot shotgun
You shooting straight from the hip
Dont shoot it dont shoot shotgun
Shake it shake it take this little hit and miss
Dont shoot shotgun
Oh shoot it Dont shoot it
Oh shotgun Shoot me baby
Let it blow
