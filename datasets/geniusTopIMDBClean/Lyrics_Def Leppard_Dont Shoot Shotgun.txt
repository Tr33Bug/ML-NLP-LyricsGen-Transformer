Donâ€™t Shoot Shotgun Lyrics
Run for cover
Don't shoot! Shoot!
She's so dangerous
Shotgun, gun
Don't shoot shotgun

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right
Falling head over heals at the speed of light
Hey little Miss Heaven on earth
Whoa, won't you walk this way but I see a red alert
Oh, my senses say keep away, so don't shoot
Don't shoot shotgun dream on nightmare
Touch and go dove turned destroyer
She cut you up, she's a slave of love
Run for cover, she's so dangerous
Undercover, she's so shameless
Don't shoot shotgun
You got me biting my lip
Don't shoot shotgun
You shooting straight from the hip
So don't shoot shotgun
Shoot me, baby!

Hit and miss, flesh and blood
She's sweet and indiscreet, she can't get enough
A little midnight madness oh baby, you can't hide
So wild and unpredictable step aside
Because you're, you're shooting wide
Run for cover, she's so dangerous
Undercover, she's so shameless

Don't shoot shotgun
You got me biting my lip
Don't shoot shotgun
You shooting straight from the hip
Oh shake it, shake it!
Ah, take this, little hit and miss

Don't shoot shotgun
You got me biting my lip
Don't shoot shotgun
You shooting straight from the hip
Don't shoot it don't shoot shotgun
Shake it, shake it take this little hit and miss
You might also like
Don't shoot shotgun
Oh shoot it! Don't shoot it
Oh shotgun! Shoot me, baby
Let it blow!Embed
