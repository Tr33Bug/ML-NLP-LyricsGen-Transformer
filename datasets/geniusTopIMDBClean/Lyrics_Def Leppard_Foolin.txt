Lady luck never smiles
So lend your love to me awhile
Do with me what you will
Break the spell take your fill
On and on we rode the storm
The flame has died and the fire has gone
Oh this empty bed is a night alone
I realized that long ago
Is anybody out there
Anybody there
Does anybody wonder
Anybody care
Oh I just got to know
If youre really there and you really care
Because baby Im not
Fffoolin ah fffoolin fffooling ah fooling
Wont you stay with me a while
Close your eyes dont run and hide
Easy love is no easy ride
Just waking up from what we had
Could stop good love from going bad
Is anybody out there
Anybody there
Does anybody wonder
Anybody care
Oh I just got to know
If youre really there and you really care
Because baby Im not
Fffoolin ah fffoolin fffooling ah fooling
Oh I just got to know
If youre really there and you really care
Because baby Im not
Fffoolin ah fffoolin fffooling ah fooling
Im not fooling myself  Not fooling myself 
Im not fooling myself  Not not not fooling myself 
Im not fooling myself  Not not not fooling myself 
Im not fooling myself  Not not not fooling myself
