Feeling like its all over
Feeling like theres no love
Feeling like its not easy
Breathing life in the dust
On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There aint going to be heroes
There aint going to be anything oh
Here it comes here comes the night
Here it comes hell in the night
Here it comes here comes the night
When we all fall down
When we walk into silence
When we shadow the sun
When we surrender to violence oh
Then the damage is done
Put away that gun
I dont want to be there
I dont want to be anywhere oh
Here it comes here comes the night
Here it comes hell in the night
Here it comes here comes the night
Were fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for
Were fighting with the Gods of war but Im a rebel
And I aint going to fight no more no way
On a countdown to zero
Take a ride on the nightmare machine
There aint going to be heroes
There aint going to be anything oh
Here it comes here comes the night
Here it comes hell in the night
Here it comes here comes the night
Were fighting for the Gods of war
But what the hell we fighting for
Were fighting with the Gods of war
And I aint going to fight no more
Stop 
Stop fighting for the Gods of war
Stop fighting for the Gods of war 
Yeah what the hell we fighting for
What in the hell we fighting for 
Were fighting with the Gods of war
Heavy
