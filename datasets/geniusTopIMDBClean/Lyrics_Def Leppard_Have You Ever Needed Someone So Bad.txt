Here I am Im in the wrong bed again
Its a game I just cant win
There you are breathing soft on my skin yeah
Still you wont let me in so come on
Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby let the moment take your heart away
Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah
Have you ever wanted someone you just couldnt have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad
And youre the girl I got to have
I got to have you baby yeah oh come on
There you go midnight promises again yeah
But theyre broken by the dawn
You want to go further faster everyday baby
But in the morning youll be gone and Im alone
Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby let the moment take your heart away
Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah
Have you ever wanted someone you just couldnt have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad
Every dream I dream is like
Some kinda rash and reckless scene
To give out such crazy love
You must be some kind of drug
And if my time dont ever come
For me youre still the one
Damned if I dont damned if I do
I got to get a fix on you
Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah
Have you ever wanted someone you just couldnt have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad
And youre the girl I got to have
I got to have you baby yeah
Its a game I just cant win oh
Have you ever needed someone so bad yeah
Have you ever wanted someone
Have you ever wanted someone you just couldnt have 
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
