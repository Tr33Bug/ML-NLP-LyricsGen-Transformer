Hey boys Miss Magic is back
No Hollywood waste or tinsel trash
A street kid shes no stray cat
Heaven on legs shes feline flash
Takes a good woman to play a good man
And no one plays like Heaven can
She said Leave your name at the sound of the tone
Call you right back when I get home
Better watch out when were all alone
Heaven is a girl I know so well
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that Ive got to have
And she makes me feel better when Im feeling bad
Hey guys Miss Magic is mine
No silicone smile shes a vintage wine
Bombshell blonde red lipstick on
Aqualine fine shes a real wild one
Heaven is a girl I know so well
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that Ive got to have
And she makes me feel better when Im feeling bad
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true
Oh no one does it good like Heaven do no
She got the rhythm to drive me crazy
She got the rhythm of love


She said Leave your name at the sound of the tone
The lights are out but theres somebody home
Better watch out when were all alone
Heaven is a girl I know so well
And she makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that Ive got to have
And she makes me feel better when Im feeling bad
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true
Oh no one does it good like Heaven do yeah
Heaven is a girl that Ive got to have
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl she makes dreams come true
And no one does it good like Heaven do
That voodoo that you do
