Heaven Is Lyrics
Hey boys, Miss Magic is back
No Hollywood waste or tinsel trash
A street kid, she's no stray cat
Heaven on legs, she's feline flash
Takes a good woman to play a good man
And no one plays like Heaven can

She said, "Leave your name at the sound of the tone
Call you right back when I get home"
Better watch out when we're all alone
Heaven is a girl I know so well
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
And she makes me feel better when I'm feeling bad

Hey guys, Miss Magic is mine
No silicone smile, she's a vintage wine
Bombshell blonde, red lipstick on
Aqualine fine, she's a real wild one


Heaven is a girl I know so well
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
And she makes me feel better when I'm feeling bad
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true
Oh, no one does it good like Heaven do, no

She got the rhythm to drive me crazy
She got the rhythm of love
You might also like
She said, "Leave your name at the sound of the tone"
The lights are out but there's somebody home
Better watch out when we're all alone

Heaven is a girl I know so well
And she makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
And she makes me feel better when I'm feeling bad
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true
Oh, no one does it good like Heaven do, yeah
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have
She makes me feel good when I feel like Hell
Heaven is a girl, she makes dreams come true
And no one does it good like Heaven do
That voodoo that you doEmbed
