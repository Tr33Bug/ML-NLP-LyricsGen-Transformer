High ‘n’ Dry (Saturday Night) Lyrics
Saturday, I feel right
I been drinking all day
Yes, I got a date, a midnight ride
I had to get it away

Yeah, I'm not a loner, I'm not a fool
Don't need a reason, reason to be cool
I got my whiskey, I got my wine
I got my woman and this time the lights are going out
(Saturday night) High
(Saturday night) High 'n' dry
(Saturday night) I'm high
(Saturday night) High 'n' dry

Ow, I feel bad, I feel mean
I'm up and down and in between
On the bottle, I'm on the line
I'm up and feeling fine

Oh, I'm not a loner, I'm not a fool
Don't need a reason, reason to be cool
I got my whiskey, I got my wine
I got my woman and this time the lights are going out

(Saturday night) High
(Saturday night) High 'n' dry
(Saturday night) I'm high
(Saturday night) High 'n' dry
Oh, take me high

Saturday, kicking out
Her train was coming to me
I gotta move, number one
Saturday night on the run
You might also like
(Saturday night) High
(Saturday night) High 'n' dry
(Saturday night) Got my whiskey
(Saturday night) Got my wine
(Saturday night) Got my woman
(Saturday night) High 'n' dry
You gotta try me tonight1Embed
