High n Dry  Saturday Night  Lyrics
Saturday I feel right
I been drinking all day
Yes I got a date a midnight ride
I had to get it away
Yeah Im not a loner Im not a fool
Dont need a reason reason to be cool
I got my whiskey I got my wine
I got my woman and this time the lights are going out
Saturday night  High
Saturday night  High n dry
Saturday night  Im high
Saturday night  High n dry
Ow I feel bad I feel mean
Im up and down and in between
On the bottle Im on the line
Im up and feeling fine
Oh Im not a loner Im not a fool
Dont need a reason reason to be cool
I got my whiskey I got my wine
I got my woman and this time the lights are going out
Saturday night  High
Saturday night  High n dry
Saturday night  Im high
Saturday night  High n dry
Oh take me high
Saturday kicking out
Her train was coming to me
I gotta move number one
Saturday night on the run


Saturday night  High
Saturday night  High n dry
Saturday night  Got my whiskey
Saturday night  Got my wine
Saturday night  Got my woman
Saturday night  High n dry
You gotta try me tonight
