Hysteria Lyrics
Out of touch, out of reach, yeah
You could try to get closer to me
I'm in love, I'm in deep, yeah
Hypnotized, I'm shaking to my knees

I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

Out of me, into you, yeah
You can hide, it's just a one way street
Oh, I believe I'm in you, yeah
Open wide that's right, dream me off my feet
Oh, believe in me

I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near
You might also like
I got to know tonight
If you're alone tonight
Can't stop this feeling
Can't stop this fire

Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria, oh, can you feel it, do you believe it?
It's such a magical mysteria
When you get that feeling better start believing
Because it's a miracle, oh, say you will, ooh babe
Hysteria when you're near

I get hysterical, hysteria
When you get that feeling, you'd better believe it
Better start believing, because it's a miracle
Oh, say you will, oh babe, say you will

Get closer to me, get closer baby
Baby, closer, get closer, closer to me7Embed
