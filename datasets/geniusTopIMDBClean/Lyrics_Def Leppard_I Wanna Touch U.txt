I Wanna Touch U Lyrics
I want to touch you
Until we're stuck like glue
I want to touch you, yeah

I get high on you
I'm on fire over you
And I can't let you go, I can't let you go
I got love on the rise and I burn like a fire
Got my eye on the prize, got love in my sights
And I can't let you go, I can't let you go
Give me no reasons, give me no rhymes
Give me that feeling all of the time

I want to touch you
Until we're stuck like glue
I want to touch you, yeah
Baby, that is true

I want to touch you
Nobody else will do, no
I want to touch you
Because a little too much
Could never be enough, no

I get wired on you and I thrill to your touch
Yeah, I excite over you
Can't stop this landslide of love
No no I can't let you go, I can't let you go, oh

You might also like


Yeah, yeah
Give me no reasons, give me no rhymes
Give me that feeling all of the time



I wanna touch you
Nobody else but you, baby
I want to touch you
Until we get enough
I want to touch you
Yeah baby let's go ride
I wanna touch you
Baby, you excite
I want to touch, touch you
Because a little too much
Could never be enough, nowEmbed
