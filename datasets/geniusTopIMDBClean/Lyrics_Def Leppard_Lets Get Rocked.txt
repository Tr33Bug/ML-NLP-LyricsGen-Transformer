Do you wanna get rocked
Lets get lets get lets get lets get rocked
Im your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing in fact thats what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy dont agree
Because when I try to get away he says he got plans for me
Get your butt right out of bed
Stop bugging me
Get up and move your sleepy head
Dont shake my tree
He said Mow the lawn who me
Walk the dog not my style man
Take out the trash no way
Tidy your room come on get real
Sorry Dad got to disappear
Lets get the rock out of here
Seven day weekend up all night
In at the deep end hang on tight
It wont take a minute it wont take long
So get on in it come on come on come on
Lets get lets get lets get lets get rocked
Lets get lets get lets get lets get rocked
Lets go all the way get it night and day
Come on lets get lets get lets get lets get rocked
Im your average ordinary everyday dude
Driving with my baby to get her in the mood
Shes dialing through my radio and Im ready to make my move
What she got aint rock n roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin Mozart Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach Tchaikovsky violins
Turn it off that aint my scene
Well Im sorry girl heres my confession

Seven day weekend up all night
In at the deep end hang on tight
It wont take a minute it wont take long
So get on in it come on come on come on
Lets get lets get lets get lets get rocked
Lets get lets get lets get lets get rocked
Lets go all the way get it night and day
Come on lets get lets get lets get lets get rocked

Every time I want to love you I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows Im sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
