If youve got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites
When you make love do you look in the mirror
Who do you think of does he look like me
Do you tell lies And say that its forever
Do you think twice or just touch and see
Ooh babe
Oh yeah
When youre alone do you let go
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show
Ooh come on
I dont want to touch you too much baby
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I dont want to be there when you decide to break it
No
Love bites love bleeds
Its bringing me to my knees
Love lives love dies
Its no surprise
Love begs love pleads
Its what I need
When Im with you are you somewhere else
Am I getting through or do you please yourself
When you wake up will you walk out
It cant be love if you throw it about
Ooh babe
I dont want to touch you too much baby
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
Oh


Love bites love bleeds
Its bringing me to my knees
Love lives love dies
Its no surprise
Love begs love pleads
Its what I need
I dont want to touch you too much baby
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I dont want to be there when you decide to break it
No
Love bites love bleeds
Its bringing me to my knees
Love lives love dies
Love bites love bleeds
Its bringing me to my knees
Love lives love dies
Its no surprise
Love begs love pleads
Its what I need
If youve got love in your sights
Watch out
Love bites
