Love and Affection Lyrics
You got the fire, baby
I got the heat, can you handle it?
I got the time, baby
You got the need, oh surrender it

Oh, it's a passion crime
With a danger sign
Oh, can you handle it?
You're just another girl
I'm just another man
It's just another night
Don't give me love and affection
Or what you think it should be
Don't give me love, the wrong reason, yeah
It won't matter to me

I got the heart, baby
You got the beat, take a chance on me
We got the night baby
We got the dream, oh imagine it

Oh, it's a passion crime
With a danger sign
Oh, can you handle it?
You're just another girl
I'm just another man
It's just another night
Don't give me love and affection
Or what you think it should be
Don't give me love
The wrong reason, yeah
It won't matter to me

I don't need your understanding
Oh babe, can't you understand me?
Come on, try it and see
You might also like
Oh, it's a passion play in a different way
Oh can you handle it? Yeah
You're just another girl
I'm just another man
It's just another night
Don't give me love and affection
Or what you think it should be
Don't give me love
The wrong reason, yeah
It won't matter to me

I don't need your understanding
Oh babe, can't you understand me?
I don't need it
(I don't need) don't need your heart
(I don't need) no understanding
(I don't need) no affection
Don't need your love
Don't give me love and affection
Don't give me love
Give me what you got
I don't need it
I don't need it
I don't need your understandingEmbed
