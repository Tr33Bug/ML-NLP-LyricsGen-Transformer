Mirror Mirror  Look into My Eyes  Lyrics
Mirror mirror
Just watching with your eye of glass
Youre just a fortune wheel
With something that I wanna ask
Mirror mirror
Got my fate lying in your hands
Youre the fool youre the juggler
Hangman and lover youre not like no other
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me what you see
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me is it true
Take a look into my eyes  Oh when I look at you
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me is it me
Is it really me
Mirror mirror
Gotta know just what you see
My crystal ball
Youre looking so sly and so sleazy
Mirror mirror
Hanging there with that crack in your eye
You make me stumble make me blind
Time after time and line by line
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me what you see
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me is it true
Take a look into my eyes  Oh when I look at you
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me is it me
Mirror mirror
Oh tell me
Youre the fool youre the juggler
I aint met a lover youre like no other so
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me what you see
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me is it true
Take a look into my eyes  Oh it just cant last
Take a look into my eyes  Gonna have to smash the glass
Take a look into my eyes 
Take a look into my eyes  Ah yeah
Take a look into my eyes 
Take a look into my eyes 
Take a look into my eyes 
Take a look into my eyes  Take a look take a look
Take a look into my eyes  Look into my eyes
Take a look into my eyes  Tell me is it real
Baby baby baby baby
