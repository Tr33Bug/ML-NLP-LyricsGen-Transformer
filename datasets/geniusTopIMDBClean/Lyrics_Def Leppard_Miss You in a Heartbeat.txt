I believe that there is something deep inside
That shouldnt be from time to time
I sure found out thought love was such a crime
The more you care the more you fall
No need to worry no need to turn away
Cause it dont matter anyway
Baby
Ooh I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh I miss you right away
Ooh I miss you in a heartbeat
Cause it aint love if it dont feel that way
When we touch I just lose my selfcontrol
A sad sensation I cant hide
To love is easy it aint easy to walk away
I keep the faith and theres a reason why
No need to worry no need to turn away
Cause it dont matter anyway
Baby
Ooh I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh I miss you right away
Ooh I miss you in a heartbeat
Cause it aint love if it dont feel that way
Now I aint big on promises
But Ill be true to you
Cause Id do about anything yeah
For someone like
Baby for you
Ooh I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh I miss you right away
Ooh I miss you in a heartbeat
Cause it aint love if it dont feel that way
