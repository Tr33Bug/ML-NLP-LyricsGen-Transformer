Huh
Im outta luck outta love
Gotta photograph picture of
Passion killer youre too much
Youre the only one I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
Youre all I want my fantasy
Oh look what youve done to this rock n roll clown
Ohoh look what youve done
Photograph 
I dont want your  Photograph 
I dont need your  Photograph 
All Ive got is a photograph
But its not enough
Id be your lover if you were there
Put your hurt on me if you dare
Such a woman you got style
You make every man feel like a child oh
You got some kinda hold on me
Youre all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free so far from me
Youre all I want my fantasy
Oh look what youve done to this rock n roll clown
Ohoh look what youve done
I gotta have your  Photograph 
I dont want your  Photograph 
I dont need your  Photograph 
All Ive got is a photograph
Youve gone straight to my head
Oh look what youve done to this rock n roll clown
Ohoh look what youve done
