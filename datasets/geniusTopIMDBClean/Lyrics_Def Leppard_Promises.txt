Last night I was blown away
I said a million things Id never say
I was knocked right down it got to me
Going to get me some of your chemistry
You want me to promise you
That everything is true
I wont make promises that I cant keep
I wont make promises that I dont mean
Ill even mean the things I tell you in my sleep yeah
I wont make promises babe that I cant keep
Oh my my I lost control
I told you everything I said it all
You came right out and said to me
Going to get me some of your honesty
I wont make promises that I cant keep
I wont make promises that I dont mean
Ill even mean the things I whisper in my sleep
Oh let me tell you

You got to believe me
I wont make promises that I cant keep
Oh baby believe me now
I wont make promises that I dont mean
Oh why wont you believe me now
Ill even mean the things I whisper in my sleep yeah

Baby you got to believe me
