Well in the middle of the night and the early morning light
You can hear them a million miles away
Theyll be banging on their drums banging on your door
Waving their flags telling you to score
Watch out for the rock brigade  rock brigade 
Oh no its the rock brigade  rock brigade 
Look out for the rock brigade
Leading you away away
So when they hit your town youd better get down
Im telling no lies to you mister
Because they live for rocknroll theyll try to steal your soul
Might even try to steal your sister
So in the middle of the night or the early morning light
If you hear them coming your way
Well youd better watch your step dont step out of line
Because here they come one more time
Watch out for the rock brigade  rock brigade 
Oh no its the rock brigade  rock brigade 
Look out for the rock brigade  rock brigade 
You better watch for the rock brigade  rock brigade 
I say watch out for the rock brigade  rock brigade 
Keep your eyes on the rock brigade  rock brigade 
Dont let your eyes off the rock brigade  rock brigade 
Theyll be leading you away away away
