Rock Rock (Till You Drop) LyricsHold on to your hat, hold on to your heart
Ready, get set to tear this place apart
Don't need a ticket
Only place in town that'll take you up to heaven
And never bring you down
Anything goes
Anything goes
Women to the left, women to the right
There to entertain you and take you through the night
So grab a little heat and come along with me
'Cause your mama don't mind what your mama don't see
Anything goes
It's alright, come on
Anything goes
We're gonna rock rock 'til you drop
Rock rock, never stop
We're gonna rock rock 'til you drop
I said rock rock to the top
Ridin' into danger, laughin' all the way
Fast, free and easy, livin' for today
Got to lip service, get it while you can
Hot, sweat, n' nervous love on demand
Anything goes
Ow!
Anything goes all night long
We're gonna rock rock 'til you drop
Come on, rock rock, never stop
You gotta rock rock 'til you drop
Ohhh
Rock rock to the top
Oh yeah!  Let's go!
(Guitar solo)

It's what I got goin' through me
Don't ever stop, do it to me
Rock rock, you really move me
Oh yeah
Here we go!
Rock rock 'til you drop
Come on, rock rock, never stop
You gotta rock rock 'til you drop
We're gonna rock rock 'til you drop, gonna take it to the top
Rock rock 'til you drop
Yeah, oh
Rock rock, never stop
Come on, come on, come on!
Yeah!
Hold on, hold on, hold tight
We're gonna rock tonight.  Too loud
Too loud, man, too loud1Embed
