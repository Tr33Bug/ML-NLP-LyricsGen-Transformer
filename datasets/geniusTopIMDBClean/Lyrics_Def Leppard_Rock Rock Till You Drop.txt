Rock Rock  Till You Drop  LyricsHold on to your hat hold on to your heart
Ready get set to tear this place apart
Dont need a ticket
Only place in town thatll take you up to heaven
And never bring you down
Anything goes
Anything goes
Women to the left women to the right
There to entertain you and take you through the night
So grab a little heat and come along with me
Cause your mama dont mind what your mama dont see
Anything goes
Its alright come on
Anything goes
Were gonna rock rock til you drop
Rock rock never stop
Were gonna rock rock til you drop
I said rock rock to the top
Ridin into danger laughin all the way
Fast free and easy livin for today
Got to lip service get it while you can
Hot sweat n nervous love on demand
Anything goes
Ow
Anything goes all night long
Were gonna rock rock til you drop
Come on rock rock never stop
You gotta rock rock til you drop
Ohhh

Oh yeah  Lets go
Guitar solo 
Rock rock give it to me
