Living by the law is a bloody necessary bore
Everybody are you getting what youre looking for
Living by the rule is something that you got to do
But does it matter if we  Break a rule or two 
Get up break out
Dont be the odd one out
Living on the edge Im a try and keep a level head
Oh 
Every morning its a bummer getting out of bed
Same old story doesnt nothing ever ever change
Yeah they lock me up and then they let me out again
Get up break out
Dont be the odd one out
Come on its alright
Were hot tonight
You better run
Run run riot 
You got to run
Run run riot 
You know the time has come
Run run riot 
I mean everyone
Run yeah run riot 
Oh got to riot babe
Going through the motions desperation guaranteed
Whoa get frustrated easily
Pedal to the metal senses working overtime
Oh a fight to the finish babe draw the line
Run
Run run riot 
You got to run
Run run riot 
You know the time has come
Run run riot 
I mean everyone
Run yeah run riot 


Speak to me
They lock me up they let me out
But Im up and running
I scream and shout
You better run
Run run riot 
You got to run
Run run riot 
You know the time has come
Run run riot 
Come on run with me
Run run riot 
Run run riot 
Hey Ill take you from your misery
Come on stick with me
