Stagefright LyricsI said, welcome to my show!
It's just a-you and me baby
We got the whole damn night to go

You're holding out on me, while I'm on fire
If you can't stand the heat, then you should try
Victim of my vices, you know you are
You skate on ice to paradise, stairway to the stars

Stagefright all night, won't you let go
All night stagefright, on with the show
You come on like a lady dressed to kill
Never thought you could be caught, but you will
A little understanding, a little love
A headline act around the back, is what I'm thinking of

Stagefright all night, won't you let go
All night stagefright, on with the show
Stagefright all night, you're dream starts today
All night stagefright, is only a heartbeat away

You're going for my head, you're going down
Getting good at being bad, you're hanging round
A fun inspired asylum, toys for the boys
Love on the rocks, forget-me-nots, you got no changeYou might also like1Embed
