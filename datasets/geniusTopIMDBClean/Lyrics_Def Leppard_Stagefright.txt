I said welcome to my show
Its just ayou and me baby
We got the whole damn night to go
Youre holding out on me while Im on fire
If you cant stand the heat then you should try
Victim of my vices you know you are
You skate on ice to paradise stairway to the stars
Stagefright all night wont you let go
All night stagefright on with the show
You come on like a lady dressed to kill
Never thought you could be caught but you will
A little understanding a little love
A headline act around the back is what Im thinking of
Stagefright all night wont you let go
All night stagefright on with the show
Stagefright all night youre dream starts today
All night stagefright is only a heartbeat away
Youre going for my head youre going down
Getting good at being bad youre hanging round
A fun inspired asylum toys for the boys
Love on the rocks forgetmenots you got no change
