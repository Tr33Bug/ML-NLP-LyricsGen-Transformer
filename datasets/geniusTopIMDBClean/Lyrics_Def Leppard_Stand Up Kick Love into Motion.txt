Stand Up  Kick Love into Motion  Lyrics
I got to know right now
Its got to be this time
I want to show you how
Going to make you change your mind
Theres an empty chair at my table yeah
Theres an empty look in your eyes
Ooh thats right
I just happen to be a man
And you happen to be a woman
We happen to be together
Try to stop this thing coming
Stand up kick love into motion
Take a little love and shake it all around stand up
Stand up kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground
Down to the ground baby come on
Stand up stand up for love
Im going to play your game
I want to play with fire
I want to breathe your air yeah
Baby going to take you there
If you lay your cards on the table ooh yeah
Ill lay my love on the line
Til youre mine
I just happen to be a man
And you happen to be a woman
And we happen to be together
Try to stop this thing coming
Stand up kick love into motion
Take a little love and shake it all around stand up
Stand up kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground
Down to the ground baby come on
Stand up stand up for love
Yeah
You couldnt get it much better
You never had it so good
Stand up together
And when youre ready to
Youre going to get what you should
Little by little
Like a fine wine
My love is like a motor
Running all the time
Step by step
Easy and slow
On the stairway to heaven
What a way to go
Stand up kick love into motion
Take a little love and shake it all around stand up
Stand up kick love into motion
Cmon take me in your arms and throw me to the ground
Stand up kick love into motion
Take me in your arms and show me what you found stand up
Stand up kick love into motion
My love is like a motor running all the time stand up
Stand up yeah kick love into motion
I said step by step
Go easy go slow stand up
Stand up kick love into motion
On a stairway to heaven
What a way to go
