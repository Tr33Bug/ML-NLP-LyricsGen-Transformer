Loves complicated love it or hate it
Im in this to win
You dont have to believe it take it or leave it
Just let it begin
From two different worlds we come crashing in
Its like a brand new day  ooh 
Stand shoulder to shoulder soldier to soldier
So show me the way
So take what you want take what you need
Take anything but just leave some for me
Take what you like if you like what you see
Theres a price to be paid cause it sure aint for free
Life is elective the unexpected
Its part of the deal
So dont try to move me this aint like a movie
This ending is real
From two different worlds we come crashing in
Its like a perfect storm  ooh 
Stand shoulder to shoulder
Soldier to soldier
So just bring it on
So take what you want take what you need
Take anything but just leave some for me
So take what you like if you like what you see
Theres a price to be paid cause it sure aint for free
All alone return to stone
As the king is overthrown
The truth begins to shine
And its mine
For now and forever


So take what you want take what you need
Take anything but just leave some for me
So take what you like if you like what you see
Theres a price to be paid cause it sure aint for free
Whoawhoa whoawhoa 
Whoawhoawhoawhoa 
Whoawhoa whoawhoa 
Whoawhoawhoawhoa
