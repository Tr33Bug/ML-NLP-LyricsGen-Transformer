Aaah Ooh
I dont want to play the waiting game
And drift away leaving an illusion
I dont want to hide its foolish pride
To close my eyes a touch away from wanting you
Dont try to look away when youre face to face
I see your eyes that animal emotion
You dont have to set your tender trap
Its in those eyes its going to happen anyway
Moving to the rhythm of your heartbeat yeah
Im wanting willing touching you well be
Moving to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Ooh babe when you get that rhythm
Going to move into your room
Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight so right this night could be dynamite
Wait and see if it pleases you it pleases me
Theres nothing I can say its no mystery
Its in your eyes those eyes are where I wanted them
So give me heart and soul I lose control
Cant stop my eyes from falling into fantasy
Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight so right this night could be dynamite
Wait and see check it out


Tonight give me love with no disguise
Tonight I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight I want to win the greatest prize
Tonight so right this night could be dynamite
Wait and see if it pleases you it pleases me
