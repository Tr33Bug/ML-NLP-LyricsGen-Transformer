Somewhere in the distance
I hear the bells ring
Darkness settles on the town
As the children start to sing
And the lady across the street
She shuts out the night
Theres a cast of thousands waiting
As she turns out the light
But its too late
Too late
Too late
Too late for love
Too late
Too late
Too late
Too late
London boys are gazing
Girls go hand in hand
With a pocket full of innocence
Their entrance is grand
And the queen of the dream
Stands before them all
She stretches out her hand
As the curtains start to fall
But its too late too late too late
Too late for love
Too late too late too late
Too late
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you
Are the actor and the clown theyre waiting for their cue
And theres a lady over there shes acting pretty cool
But when it comes to playing life she always plays the fool
But its too late too late too late
Too late for love
Too late too late too late
Too late


Is it all too late
Much too late
Cant you see its all too late
Yeah its too late
But its too late too late too late
Too late for love
Too late too late too late
Too late
But its too late too late too late
Too late for love
Too late too late too late
Too late
