Walk away if you want to
Its ok if you need to
You can run but you can never hide
From the shadow thats creeping up beside you
Theres a magic running through your soul
But you cant have it all
Whatever you do 
Ill be two steps behind you
Wherever you go 
And Ill be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and Ill be two steps behind
Take the time
To think about it
Walk the line you know you just cant fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire thats burning up inside me
Theres a magic running through your soul
But you cant have it all
Whatever you do 
Ill be two steps behind you
Wherever you go 
And Ill be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and Ill be two steps behind
Theres a magic running through your soul
But you you cant have it all
Whatever you do 
Ill be two steps behind you
wherever you go 
And Ill be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around and Ill be two steps behind
Two steps behind
Yeah baby
Two steps behind
Ohh sugar
Two steps behind
