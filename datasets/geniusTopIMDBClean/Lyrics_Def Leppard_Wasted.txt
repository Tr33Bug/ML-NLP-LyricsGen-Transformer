Well Ive been lying awake all night just thinking of you
But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view
Ive got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills
And I know that Im leading a life that kills
Wasted  Ive wasted my time
Wasted  Im shooting a line
Wasted  Im stuck in a hole
Wasted  Im losing control
And Ive been meaning to call Ive been wanting to phone
You see I dont like the thought of leaving you here alone
Well Ive seen things down here that are fit for a queen
Ive seen things down here that should never be seen
Wasted  Ive wasted my money
Wasted  Ive wasted you honey
Wasted  Im out of my brain
Wasted  Im going insane
Im running in thin air
Theres nothingness everywhere
Ive got to get out oh wont you help me
Ive got to get out oh wont you help me
Ive got to get out oh wont you help me get out
I thought I saw you just the other day
But it couldnt be you because you had nothing to say
Hes going away they told all my friends
Well now Ill be stuck in here until the misery ends
Wasted  Ive wasted my time
Wasted  Im shooting a line
Wasted  Im out of my head
Wasted  I wish I was dead
