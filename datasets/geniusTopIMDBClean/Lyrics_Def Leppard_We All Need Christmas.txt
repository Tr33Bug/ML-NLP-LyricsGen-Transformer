So heres to you and all you do
Lets raise a glass to all thats past and to the future long may it last
Ohh let it last
And may the light shine on you and trust your hopes to see it through
Forever after let it be true for me and you
We all need Christmas we all need someone to need
Open your heart and let love breathe this Christmas
So say a prayer to light the day for those weve lost along the way
They may be gone but they still remain in our hearts in our name
We all need Christmas we all need someone to need
Open your heart and let love breathe
We all need Christmas we all need love to succeed
Follow your heart and let love lead this Christmas
We all need Christmas we all need someone to need
Open your heart and let love breathe
We all need Christmas we all need love to succeed
Follow your heart and let love lead this Christmas
