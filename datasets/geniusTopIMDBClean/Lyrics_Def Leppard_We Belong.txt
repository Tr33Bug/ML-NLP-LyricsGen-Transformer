Sometimes I feel I dont belong here
Sometimes I just dont feel
I feel so uninvited
A wound that never heals
I need a little shelter
Just for a little while
Sometimes I hide the sadness
Behind a painted smile
If you cast the first stone
I will roll it away
I will kneel at your throne
Hold my hands up and pray
I will hold back the tide
Push the oceans aside
Save the day
But I can be stronger
Youre all that I am
Youre all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
So dont hold me back
Dont hold me down
Just hold me and dont let go
Youre all that I am
Youre all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me Im right
Cause this cant move on
Not if we belong
Whatever happened to forgiveness
Are the words too hard to say

What happened to the answers
They disappeared along the way
I hide behind the madness
Still looking for the clues
And theres nothing left to chance
When theres nothing left to lose
And the voice in my head
Screams the words I believe
And the light in the dark
Is the air that I breathe
Youre all that I am
Youre all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
So dont hold me back
Dont hold me down
Just hold me and dont let go
Youre all that I am
Youre all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me Im right
Cause this cant move on
Back where we belong
As you cast the first stone
And I roll it away
And I kneel at your throne
These words that I say
Youre all that I am
Youre all that I see
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
So dont hold me back
Dont hold me down
Just hold me and dont let go
Youre all that I am
Youre all that I do
The end of the rainbow
Is waiting for you
So tell me Im right
Cause this cant be wrong
Not if we belong
The keys to the kingdom
Are waiting for me
