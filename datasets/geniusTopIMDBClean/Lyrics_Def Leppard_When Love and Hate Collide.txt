You could have a change of heart if you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone girl for the hundredth time
I got your number on my wall but I aint gonna make that call
When divided we stand baby united we fall
Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it
All I know I cant fight this flame
You could have a change of heart if you would only change your mind
Cause Im crazy bout you baby time after time
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Cant stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide
I dont wanna fight no more I dont know what were fighting for
When we treat each other baby like an act of war
I could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger hits you right between the eyes
Theres a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know got to win this time
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Cant stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide


You could have a change of heart if you would only change your mind
Cause Im crazy bout you babyCrazyCrazy
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
If you have a heart at all
Without you
Cant stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide
