No promises no guarantees
When you come down here youre already on your knees
You want to ride white lightning then sign your name
If you want to dance with the Devil
You got to play his way play the game
You got to taste that sweetness
Because you cant say no
But are you ready for the nightmare when you cant let go
Like a soldier of fortune when the money runs dry
You got rivers of bitter tears in your eyes
You want to leave but you cant let go
You want stop but you cant say no
Youll never laugh about it you just cant live without it
You had enough but you just want more
You never get what youre looking for
Youll never laugh about it never
You got both ends burning like a moth to a flame
Youre going off the rails like a runaway train
Its a no win situation theres no way out
And no one will ever hear you
Scream and shout
Run hes coming to claim you
Run nowhere to hide away
Run you dance with danger
Run oh you got to ride the
White lightning on a dead end street
White lightning where the deadbeats meet
White lightning its a one way ride
White lightning oh theres nowhere to hide
Oh can you believe me babe
Such a lonely road you ride
Its not easy when you dont know why
Such a heavy load you hide
You never leave no matter how you try
White lightning can you feel it can you feel it
White lightning its so dangerous
White lightning no promises no guarantees
White lightning
