In the beginning God made the land
Then he made the water and creatures then he made man
He was born with a passion love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something missing something lost
So he came with the answer heres what it cost
One part love one part wild one part lady one part child
I give you  Women women 
Lots of pretty women
Men men  They cant live without them
Women women  Lots of pretty women
Men men  They cant live without them
And in the garden lust began
The animal instinct the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger an appetite
And filling with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love one part child
One part lover one part wild
I give you  Women women 
Lots of pretty women
Men men  They cant live without them
Women women  Lots of pretty women
Men men  They cant live without them
Skin on skin
Let the love begin
Women
It was one part love one part wild
One part lover one part child
A whole lot of fire a little bit of ice
A whole lot of something you cant sacrifice


I give you  Hair eyes skin on skin
Legs  Legs
Thighs  Thighs
Whats that spell  Spell whats that spell 
Whats that spell  Whats that spell
Whats that spell   Women women 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Women  Women
Women  Calling every girl
Women women  All around the world
Women  Women
Women  Oh we cant live without them
Women  Women
