Im not sure what Im looking for anymore
I just know that Im harder to console
I dont see who Im trying to be instead of me
But the key is a question of control
Can you say what youre trying to play anyway
I just pay while youre breaking all the rules
All the signs that I find have been underlined
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled
All this running around well its getting me down
Just give me a pain that Im used to
I dont need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
Theres a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience repentance unknown
Close your eyes pay the price for your paradise
Devils feed on the seeds that are sown
I cant conceal what I feel what I know is real
No mistaking the faking I care
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there
On a note full of hope not despair
All this running around well its getting me down
Just give me a pain that Im used to
I dont need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
All this running around well its getting me down
Just give me a pain that Im used to
I dont need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
