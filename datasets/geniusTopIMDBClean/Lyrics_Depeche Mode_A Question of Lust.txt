Fragile like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me Id never willingly do you harm
Apologies are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child you make me smile when you care for me
And you know
Its a question of lust its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting what weve built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Independence is still important for us though
We realise 
Its easy to make the stupid mistake of letting go
Do you know what I mean 
My weaknesses you know each and every one
It frightens me 
But I need to drink more than you seem to think before Im anyones
And you know
Its a question of lust its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting what weve built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Kiss me goodbye when Im on my own
But you know that Id rather be home
Its a question of lust its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting what weve built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Its a question of lust its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting what weve built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together


Its a question of lust its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting what weve built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Its a question of lust its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting what weve built up crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
