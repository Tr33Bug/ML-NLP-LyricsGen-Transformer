Ive got to get to you first
Before they do
Its just a question of time
Before they lay their hands on you
And make you just like the rest
Ive got to get to you first
Its just a question of time
Well now youre only fifteen
And you look good
Ill take you under my wing
Somebody should
Theyve persuasive ways
And youll believe what they say
Its just a question of time
And its running out for you
It wont be long until youll do
Exactly what they want you to
I can see them now
Hanging around
To mess you up
To strip you down
And have their fun
With my little one
Its just a question of time
And its running out for you
It wont be long until youll do
Exactly what they want you to
It wont be long until youll do
Exactly what they want you to
Sometimes I dont blame them
For wanting you
You look good
And they need something to do
Until I look at you
And then I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in our minds


Its just a question of time
Its just a question of time
Its just a question of time  It should be better 
Its just a question of time  It should be better with you 
Its just a question of time  It should be better 
Its just a question of time  It should be better with you 
Its just a question of time  It should be better 
Its just a question of time  It should be better with you 
Its just a question of time
