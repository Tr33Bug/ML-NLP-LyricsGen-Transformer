Do you mean this horny creep
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesnt come
This twisted tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Whos longing for some rest
And feeling numb
What do you expect of me
What is it you want
Whatever youve planned for me
Im not the one
A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And wont be satisfied
Wont be denied
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside
What am I supposed to do
When everything that Ive done
Is leading me to conclude
Im not the one
Whatever Ive done
Ive been staring down the barrel of a gun
Whatever Ive done
Ive been staring down the barrel of a gun
Whatever Ive done  Whatever whatever 
Is there something you need from me
Are you having your fun
I never agreed to be
Your holy one
Whatever Ive done
Ive been staring down the barrel of a gun
Whatever Ive done  Whatever whatever 
Ive been staring down the barrel of a gun
Whatever Ive done  Whatever whatever 
Ive been staring down the barrel of a gun
