My little girl drive anywhere
Do what you want I dont care
Tonight Im in the hands of fate
I hand myself over on a plate now
Oh little girl there are times when I feel
Id rather not be the one behind the wheel
Come pull my strings
Watch me move I do anything please
Sweet little girl I prefer
You behind the wheel and me the passenger
Drive Im yours to keep
Do what you want Im going cheap tonight
Youre behind the wheel tonight
Youre behind the wheel tonight
Youre behind the wheel tonight
Youre behind the wheel tonight
Youre behind the wheel tonight
