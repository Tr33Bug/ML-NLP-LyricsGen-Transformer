Black Celebration Lyrics
Let's have a black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day

I look to you, how you carry on
When all hope is gone, can't you see?
Your optimistic eyes seem like paradise
To someone like me
I want to take you in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today

Black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day

I look to you and your strong belief
Me, I want relief tonight
Consolation, I want so much
Want to feel your touch tonight

Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldn't do today

Black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
Black celebration (I'll drink to that)
Black celebration
Tonight
Black celebration (I'll drink to that)
Black celebration
