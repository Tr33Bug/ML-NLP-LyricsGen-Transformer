Lets have a black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That weve seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you how you carry on
When all hope is gone cant you see
Your optimistic eyes seem like paradise
To someone like me
I want to take you in my arms
Forgetting all I couldnt do today
Black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That weve seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you and your strong belief
Me I want relief tonight
Consolation I want so much
Want to feel your touch tonight
Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldnt do today
Black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
Black celebration  Ill drink to that 
Black celebration
Tonight
Black celebration  Ill drink to that 
Black celebration
Tonight
