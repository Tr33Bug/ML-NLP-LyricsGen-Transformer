Girl of sixteen whole life ahead of her
Slashed her wrists bored with life
Didnt succeed thank the Lord
For small mercies
Fighting back the tears mother reads the note again
Sixteen candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame its always the same
She goes down on her knees and prays
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humour
And when I die I expect to find him laughing
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humour
And when I die I expect to find him laughing
Girl of eighteen fell in love with everything
Found new life in Jesus Christ
Hit by a car ended up
On a life support machine
Summers day as she passed away
Birds were singing in the summer sky
Then came the rain and once again
A tear fell from her mothers eye


I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humour
And when I die I expect to find him laughing
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humour
And when I die I expect to find him laughing
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humour
And when I die I expect to find him laughing
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humour
And when I die I expect to find him laughing
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humour
And when I die I expect to find him laughing
