Put it on and dont say a word
Put it on the one that I prefer
Put it on and stand before my eyes
Put it on please dont question why
Can you believe
Something so simple
Something so trivial
Makes me a happy man
Cant you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy it is to please me
Because when you learn
Youll know what makes the world turn
Put it on I can feel so much
Put it on I dont need to touch
Put it on here before my eyes
Put it on because you realise
And you believe
Something so worthless
Serves a purpose
It makes me a happy man
Cant you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy it is to please me
Because when you learn
Youll know what makes the world turn
