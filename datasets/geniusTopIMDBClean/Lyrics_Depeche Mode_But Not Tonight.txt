Oh God its raining but Im not complaining
Its filling me up with new life
The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes
Theyre lighting my way tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
Just for a day on a day like today
Ill get away from this constant debauchery
The wind in my hair makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
But theyre not like tonight
Oh God its raining and Im not containing
My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own all on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
Id been mistaken for dead
But not tonight
