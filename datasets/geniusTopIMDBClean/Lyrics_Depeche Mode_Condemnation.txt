Condemnation tried
Here on the stand with the book in my hand
And truth on my side
Accusations lies
Hand me my sentence Ill show no repentance
Ill suffer with pride
If for honesty you want apologies
I dont sympathise
If for kindness you substitute blindness
Please open your eyes
Condemnation why
Because my duty was always to beauty
And that was my crime
Feel elation high
To know I can trust this fix of injustice
Time after time
If you see purity as immaturity
Well its no surprise
If for kindness you substitute blindness
Please open your eyes
