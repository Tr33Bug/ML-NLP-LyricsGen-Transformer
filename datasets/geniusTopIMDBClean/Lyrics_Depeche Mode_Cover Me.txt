Ive felt better
Ive been up all night
I can feel it coming
The morning light
The air is so cold here
Its so hard to breathe
We better take cover
Will you cover me
Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond you and me
I dreamt of us in another life
One weve never reached
You know were sinking
We could fade away
Im not going down
Not today
The air is so cold here
Too cold to see
We have to take cover
Cover me
Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond these broken bars
I pictured us in another life
Where were all super stars
