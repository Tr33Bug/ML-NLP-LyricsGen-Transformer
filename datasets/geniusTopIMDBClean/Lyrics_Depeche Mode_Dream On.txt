Can you feel a little love
As your boney fingers close around me
Long and spindly death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see
Hey you pale and sickly child
Youre death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take wont kill you
But careful what youre given mmh
Theres no time for hesitating
Pain is ready pain is waiting
Primed to do its educating
Unwanted uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you
Feel the fever coming
Youre shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that wont stop you itching
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on
Mmh mmh mmh mmh
Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines its wellrehearsed
It sucked you in it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take wont kill you
But careful what youre given
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream on
