Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me pierce right through me
Cant you understand Oh my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense words are trivial
Pleasures remain so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm


Enjoy the silence
