Oh little one
I will protect you
And surround you with my love
As well as any man can
As well as any man could
I will be there for you
Always
And when the black cloud
Rises
And the radiation falls
I will look you in the eye
And kiss you
And give you all my love
As well as any man can
As well as any man could
You are my eternal
Eternal
Love
