The handshake seals the contract
From the contract theres no turning back
The turning point of a career
In Korea being insincere
The holiday was funpacked
The contract still intact
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
Its a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
The graph on the wall
Tells the story of it all
Picture it now see just how
The lies and deceit gained a little more power
Confidence taken in
By a suntan and a grin
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves after all
Its a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything everything 
Everything everything 


The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts
