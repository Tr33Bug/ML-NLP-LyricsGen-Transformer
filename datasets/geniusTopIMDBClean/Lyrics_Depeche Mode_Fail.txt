Fail Lyrics
People
Do we call this trying?
We're hopeless
Forget the denying
Our souls are corrupt
Our minds are messed up
Our consciences bankrupt
Oh, we're fucked

People
What are we thinking?
It's shameful
Our standards are sinking
We're barely hanging on
Our spirit has gone
And once where it shone
I hear a lonesome song
People
How are we coping?
It's futile
To even start hoping
That justice will prevail
That truth will tip the scales
Our dignity has sailed
Oh, we've failedYou might also like2Embed
