People
Do we call this trying
Were hopeless
Forget the denying
Our souls are corrupt
Our minds are messed up
Our consciences bankrupt
Oh were fucked
People
What are we thinking
Its shameful
Our standards are sinking
Were barely hanging on
Our spirit has gone
And once where it shone
I hear a lonesome song
People
How are we coping
Its futile
To even start hoping
That justice will prevail
That truth will tip the scales
Our dignity has sailed
Oh weve failed
