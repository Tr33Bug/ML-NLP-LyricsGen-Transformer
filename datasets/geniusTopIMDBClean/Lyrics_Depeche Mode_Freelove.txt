If youve been hiding from love
If youve been hiding from love
I can understand where youre coming from
I can understand where youre coming from
If youve suffered enough
If youve suffered enough
I can understand what youre thinking of
I can see the pain that youre frightened of
And Im only here
To bring you free love
Lets make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
Ive been running like you
Ive been running like you
Now you understand why Im running scared
Now you understand why Im running scared
Ive been searching for truth
Ive been searching for truth
And I havent been getting anywhere
No I havent been getting anywhere
And Im only here
To bring you free love
Lets make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
Hey girl youve got to take this moment
Then let it slip away
Let go of complicated feelings
Then theres no price to pay
Weve been running from love
Weve been running from love
And we dont know what were doing here
No we dont know what were doing here
And were only here
Sharing our free love
Lets make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch no strings attached
Just free love
