I feel you your sun it shines
I feel you within my mind
You take me there you take me where the kingdom comes
You take me to and lead me through Babylon
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our love
I feel you your heart it sings
I feel you the joy it brings
Where heaven waits those golden gates and back again
You take me to and lead me through oblivion
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our love
I feel you your precious soul
And I am whole
I feel you your rising sun
My kingdom comes
I feel you each move you make
I feel you each breath you take
Where angels sing and spread their wings my loves on high
You take me home to glorys throne by and by
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our love
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our love
