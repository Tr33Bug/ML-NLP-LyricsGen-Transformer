In your room
Where time stands still
Or moves at your will
Will you let the morning come soon
Or will you leave me lying here
In your favourite darkness
Your favourite halflight
Your favourite consciousness
Your favourite slave
In your room
Where souls disappear
Only you exist here
Will you lead me to your armchair
Or leave me lying here
Your favourite innocence
Your favourite prize
Your favourite smile
Your favourite slave
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here


In your room
Your burning eyes
Cause flames to arise
Will you let the fire die down soon
Or will I always be here
Your favourite passion
Your favourite game
Your favourite mirror
Your favourite slave
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
