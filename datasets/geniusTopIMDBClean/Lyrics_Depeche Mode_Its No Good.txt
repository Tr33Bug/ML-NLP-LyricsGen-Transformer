Im gonna take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above
The gods decree
Youll be right here by my side
Right next to me
You can run but you cannot hide
Dont say you want me
Dont say you need me
Dont say you love me
Its understood
Dont say youre happy
Out there without me
I know you cant be
Cause its no good
Ill be fine
Ill be waiting patiently
Till you see the signs
And come running to my open arms
When will you realise
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide
Open up your eyes
You cant turn back the tide
Dont say you want me
Dont say you need me
Dont say you love me
Its understood
Dont say youre happy
Out there without me
I know you cant be
Cause its no good
Im going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above


Dont say you want me
Dont say you need me
Dont say you love me
Its understood
Dont say youre happy
Out there without me
I know you cant be
Cause its no good
Dont say you want me
Dont say you need me
Dont say you love me
Its understood
Dont say youre happy
Out there without me
I know you cant be
Cause its no good
