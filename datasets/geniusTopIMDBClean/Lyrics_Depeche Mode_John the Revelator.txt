John the Revelator put him in an elevator
Take him up to the highest high
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop
Let him tell his book of lies
John the Revelator hes a smooth operator
Its time we cut him down to size
Take him by the hand and put him on the stand
Let us hear his alibis
By claiming God as his holy right
Hes stealing a god from the Israelites
Stealing a god from the Muslim too
There is only one god through and through
Seven lies multiplied by seven
Multiplied by seven again
Seven angels with seven trumpets
Send them home on the morning train
Well whos that shouting John the Revelator
All he ever gives us is pain
Well whos that shouting John the Revelator
He should bow his head in shame
By and by
By and by
By and by
By and by
Seven lies multiplied by seven
Multiplied by seven again
Seven angels with seven trumpets
Send them home on the morning train
Well whos that shouting John the Revelator
All he ever gives us is pain
Well whos that shouting John the Revelator
He should bow his head in shame
