When Im with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just cant seem to get enough of
We walk together
Were walking down the street
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
Its getting hotter its a burning love
And I just cant seem to get enough of
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough


And when it rains
Youre shining down for me
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
Youre like an angel and you give me your love
And I just cant seem to get enough of
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
