Master and Servant Lyrics
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot like life

There's a new game we like to play, you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog, get me down on my knees
We call it master and servant
We call it master and servant

It's a lot like life, this play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

It's a lot like life and that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one

Domination's the name of the game
In bed or in life, they're both just the same
Except in one you're fulfilled at the end of the day

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

(Master and servant)
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot like life
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot like life
(Master and servant)
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot, it's a lot
It's a lot like life

It's a lot like life and that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one
Let's play master and servant (Come on)
Come on, master and servant (Come on)
Let's play master and servant (Come on)
Come on, master and servant (Come on)
Let's play master and servant (Come on)
Come on, master and servant (Come on)2Embed
