Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot like life
Theres a new game we like to play you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog get me down on my knees
We call it master and servant
We call it master and servant
Its a lot like life this play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality
Lets play master and servant
Lets play master and servant
Its a lot like life and thats whats appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one
Dominations the name of the game
In bed or in life theyre both just the same
Except in one youre fulfilled at the end of the day
Lets play master and servant
Lets play master and servant


Come on 
Come on 
Master and servant 
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot like life
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot like life
Master and servant 
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot its a lot
Its a lot like life
Its a lot like life and thats whats appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one
