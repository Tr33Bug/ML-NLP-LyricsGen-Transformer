Im taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where hes taking me
Taking me where I want to be
Im taking a ride with my best friend
Were flying high
Were watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Im taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me Im as safe as houses
As long as I remember whos wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again
Were flying high
Were watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Were flying high
Were watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down
See the stars theyre shining bright
Never let me down 
Everythings all right tonight
Never let me down 
See the stars theyre shining bright
Never let me down 
Everythings all right tonight
Never let me down 
See the stars theyre shining bright
Never let me down 
Everythings all right tonight
Never let me down 
See the stars theyre shining bright
Never let me down 
Everythings all right tonight
Never let me down
