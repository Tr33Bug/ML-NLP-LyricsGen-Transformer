No More  This is the Last Time  Lyrics
One more ride
I cant explain
Our hesitation
We stop and start again
Repeat the process
We repeat the lie
Time and time again
By and by
This is the last time
Ill say goodbye
The last time
Then we wont have to lie
The last time
Call it what you want
You dont mean a thing to me no more
You go your way
Ill go mine
Weve walked this line together
For the longest time
Weve climbed the mountain
In so many ways
Reach the top
Then slowly fade away
This is the last time
Ill say goodbye
The last time
Then we wont have to lie
The last time
Call it what you want
You dont mean a thing to me no more
Our crimes
Will pass us by
Crimes
They all fade and die
All those memories
All our pain
Will slowly disappear
Like the falling rain


This is the last time
Ill say goodbye
The last time
Then we wont have to lie
The last time
All those memories all our pain 
This is the last time
All those memories all our pain 
The last time
