People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
So were different colours and were different creeds
And different people have different needs
Its obvious you hate me though Ive done nothing wrong
Ive never even met you so what could I have done
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
Help me understand 
Help me understand help me understand 
Now youre punching and youre kicking and youre shouting at me
Im relying on your common decency
So far it hasnt surfaced but Im sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel from your head to your fists  Head to your fists 
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Why should it be 
Help me understand
I cant understand
What makes a man
Why should it be 
Hate another man
Help me understand
I cant understand
What makes a man
Why should it be 
Hate another man
Help me understand
