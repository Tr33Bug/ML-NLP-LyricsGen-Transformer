Poison Heart Lyrics
You have poison in your heart
Yeah I'm sure of it
I knew right from the start
From the moment we met
You know we have to break up
You'll always be alone

You know you've never ever been a friend
Now we're closer to the edge
Oh oh oh, no
Oh oh oh, no
There's poison in your mind
Yeah I'm sure of it
You've never been that kind
With all due respect
You know it's time to break up
You'll always be alone

You know you've never ever been a friend
Now we're closer to the end
Oh oh oh, no
Oh oh oh, no

We've been walking far too long this icy road
My broken heart is colder than a stone
I know you've never ever been a friend
Now you've pushed me to the end

Oh oh oh, no
Oh oh oh, noYou might also likeEmbed
