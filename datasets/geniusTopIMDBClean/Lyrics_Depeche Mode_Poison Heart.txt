You have poison in your heart
Yeah Im sure of it
I knew right from the start
From the moment we met
You know we have to break up
Youll always be alone
You know youve never ever been a friend
Now were closer to the edge
Oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no
Theres poison in your mind
Yeah Im sure of it
Youve never been that kind
With all due respect
You know its time to break up
Youll always be alone
You know youve never ever been a friend
Now were closer to the end
Oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no
Weve been walking far too long this icy road
My broken heart is colder than a stone
I know youve never ever been a friend
Now youve pushed me to the end
Oh oh oh no
Oh oh oh no
