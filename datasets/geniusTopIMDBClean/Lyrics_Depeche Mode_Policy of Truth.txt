You had something to hide
Should have hidden it shouldnt you
Now youre not satisfied
With what youre being put through
Its just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth
Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilized
You will always wonder how
It could have been if youd only lied
Its too late to change events
Its time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Now youre standing there tonguetied
Youd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell
Youll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
