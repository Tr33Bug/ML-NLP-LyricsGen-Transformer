Precious and fragile things
Need special handling
My God what have we done to you
We always tried to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put you through
Things get damaged things get broken
I thought wed manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
Angels with silver wings
Shouldnt know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope its your eyes Hes seeing through
Things get damaged things get broken
I thought wed manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two
Things get damaged things get broken
I thought wed manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
