Hey scum hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone
Hey scum hey scum
What are you going to do when karma comes
A calling
And youre falling
And theres nowhere left to run
And youre weeping
And not sleeping
And youre begging for your gun
Pull the trigger
Hey scum hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone
Hey scum hey scum
What will you do when judgement time has come
And youre kneeling
And youre squealing
And youre looking for someone
To bear witness
To your goodness
You cant even find your son
Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
You wouldnt even offer up your crumbs
To the dying
And the crying
Youre dead inside youre numb
Youre hollow
And shallow
Your empty life is done
Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
Hey scum hey scum
Pull the trigger
Hey scum hey scum
Pull the trigger
