Scum Lyrics
Hey scum, hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone
Hey scum, hey scum
What are you going to do when karma comes

A' calling
And you're falling
And there's nowhere left to run
And you're weeping
And not sleeping
And you're begging for your gun
Pull the trigger

Hey scum, hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone
Hey scum, hey scum
What will you do when judgement time has come

And you're kneeling
And you're squealing
And you're looking for someone
To bear witness
To your goodness
You can't even find your son

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

You wouldn't even offer up your crumbs

To the dying
And the crying
You're dead inside, you're numb
You're hollow
And shallow
Your empty life is done
You might also like
Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
Hey scum, hey scum
Pull the trigger
Hey scum, hey scum
Pull the trigger2Embed
