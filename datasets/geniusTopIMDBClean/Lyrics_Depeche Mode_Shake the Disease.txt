Im not going down on my knees begging you to adore me
Cant you see its misery and torture for me
When Im misunderstood
Try as hard as you can Ive tried as hard as I could
To make you see
How important it is for me
Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these
Understand me understand me
Understand me understand me
Some people have to be permanently together
Lovers devoted to each other forever
Now Ive got things to do
And Ive said before that I know you have too
When Im not there
In spirit Ill be there
Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these
Understand me understand me
Understand me understand me
Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these


Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these
Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these
