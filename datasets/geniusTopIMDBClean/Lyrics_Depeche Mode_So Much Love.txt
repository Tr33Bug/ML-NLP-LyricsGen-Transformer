I cant lie
I cant fake
I cant act
My hands shake
Theres disclosure
I must make
There is so much love in me
I cant run
I have tried
Theres a thorn
In my side
There is something
I cant hide
There is so much love in me
You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you cant shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So
Theres a fire
In my veins
The desire
Causes pain
I will say it
Again


There is so much love in me
You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you cant shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
