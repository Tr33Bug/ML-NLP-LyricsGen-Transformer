I want somebody to share share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts know my intimate details
Someone wholl stand by my side and give me support
And in return shell get my support
She will listen to me when I want to speak
About the world we live in and life in general
Though my views may be wrong they may even be perverted
Shell hear me out and wont easily be converted
To my way of thinking in fact shell often disagree
But at the end of it all she will understand me
I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone wholl help me see things in a different light
All the things I detest I will almost like
I dont want to be tied to anyones strings
Im carefully trying to steer clear of those things
But when Im asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
Though things like this make me sick
In a case like this Ill get away with it
