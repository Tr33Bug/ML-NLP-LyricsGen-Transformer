Therell be times when my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think Ive had enough from your sea of love
Ill take more than another riverful
Yes and Ill make it all worthwhile
Ill make your heart smile
Strangelove strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove thats how my love goes
Strangelove will you give it to me
Will you take the pain I will give to you
Again and again and will you return it
Therell be days when Ill stray
I may appear to be constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
Im not trying to say Ill have it all my way
Im always willing to learn when youve got something to teach
Oh and Ill make it all worthwhile
Ill make your heart smile
Pain will you return it
Ill say it again pain
Pain will you return it
Ill say it again pain
Pain will you return it
Ill say it again pain
Pain will you return it
I wont say it again
Strangelove strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove thats how my love goes
Strangelove will you give it to me
Strangelove strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove thats how my love goes
Strangelove will you give it to me
Strangelove strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove thats how my love goes
Strangelove will you give it to me


I give in
Again and again
I give in
Will you give it to me
I give in
Ill say it again
I give in
I give in
Again and again
I give in
Thats how my love goes
I give in
Ill say it again
I give in
