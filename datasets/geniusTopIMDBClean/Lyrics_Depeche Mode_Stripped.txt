Come with me into the trees
Well lay on the grass and let the hours pass
Take my hand come back to the land
Lets get away just for one day
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Metropolis has nothing on this
Youre breathing in fumes I taste when we kiss
Take my hand come back to the land
Where everythings ours for a few hours
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you make decisions without your television
Let me hear you speaking just for me
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you speaking just for me 
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you crying just for me 
Let me see you stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you speaking just for me
