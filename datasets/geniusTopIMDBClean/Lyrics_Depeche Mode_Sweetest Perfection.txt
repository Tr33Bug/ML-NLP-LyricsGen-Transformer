The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldnt finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind
I stop and I stare too much
Afraid that I care too much
And I hardly dare to touch
For fear that the spell may be broken
When I need a drug in me
And it brings out the thug in me
Feel something tugging me
Then I want the real thing not tokens
The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldnt finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind
Things youd expect to be
Having effect on me
Pass undetectedly
But everyone knows what has got me
Takes me completely
Touches so sweetly
Reaches so deeply
I know that nothing can stop me
Sweetest perfection
An offer was made
An assorted collection
But I wouldnt trade


The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldnt finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind
The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldnt finely hone
Nothing can stop me 
The sweetest infection
Takes me completely 
Of body and mind
Touches so sweetly 
Sweetest injection
Reaches so deeply 
Of any kind
Nothing can stop me 
The sweetest perfection
Takes me completely 
To call my own
Touches so sweetly 
The slightest correction
Reaches so deeply 
Couldnt finely hone
Nothing can stop me 
The sweetest infection
Takes me completely 
Of body and mind
Touches so sweetly 
Sweetest injection
Reaches so deeply 
Of any kind
Nothing can stop me
