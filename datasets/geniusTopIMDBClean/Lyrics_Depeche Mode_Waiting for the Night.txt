Im waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everythings dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
Im waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity
There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon
Im waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everythings dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
Im waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity
There is a sound in the calm
Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
Its easier here just to forget fear
And when I squinted
The world seemed rosetinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With halfclosed eyes
Things looked even better than when they were opened
Been waiting for the night to fall
I knew that it will save us all
Now everythings dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
Been waiting for the night to fall
Now everything is bearable
And here in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity
