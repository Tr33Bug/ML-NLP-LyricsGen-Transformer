Youve been kept down
Youve been pushed round
Youve been lied to
Youve been fed truths
Whos making your decisions
You or your religion
Your government your countries
You patriotic junkies
Wheres the revolution
Come on people
Youre letting me down
Wheres the revolution
Come on people
Youre letting me down
Youve been pissed on
For too long
Your rights abused
Your views refused
They manipulate and threaten
With terror as a weapon
Scare you till youre stupefied
Wear you down until youre on their side
Wheres the revolution
Come on people
Youre letting me down
Wheres the revolution
Come on people
Youre letting me down
The train is coming

The engines humming

So get on board
