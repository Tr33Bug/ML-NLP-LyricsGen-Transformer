Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique
Wrong
Wrong
Theres something wrong with me chemically
Something wrong with me inherently
The wrong mix in the wrong genes
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means
It was the wrong plan in the wrong hands
With the wrong theory for the wrong man
The wrong eyes on the wrong prize
The wrong questions with the wrong replies
Wrong
Wrong
I was marching to the wrong drum
With the wrong scum
Pissing out the wrong energy
Using all the wrong lines
And the wrong signs
With the wrong intensity
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook
Made the wrong move every wrong night
With the wrong tune played til it sounded right yeah
Wrong
Wrong  Too long 
Wrong  Too long 
Wrong  Too long 
Wrong  Too long 
Wrong  Too long 
Wrong  Too long 
I was born with the wrong sign  Wrong 
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy  Too long 
I took the wrong road  Wrong 
That led to the wrong tendencies  Too long 
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time  Wrong 
For the wrong reason  Too long  and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of  Wrong  the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique
Wrong
