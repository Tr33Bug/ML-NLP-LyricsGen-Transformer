If you need me call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
Ill be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
You see my love is alive
Its like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please my darling let it be me
I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words
No wind  no wind  no rain  no rain 
Nor winters cold
Can stop me babe  oh babe  baby  baby 
If youre my goal
No wind no rain
Can stop
If you want to go
I know I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
Youll always have me
And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close or the lips
That used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free
Aint no mountain high enough aah
Aint no valley low enough
Aint no river wide enough
To keep me from you
Aint no mountain high enough
Aint no valley low enough  say it again 
Aint no river wide enough
To keep me from you
Aint no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you
Aint no mountain high enough
Aint no valley low enough  one more time 
Aint no river wide enough  say it again 
To keep me from you
Aint no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you
Nothing in this world
