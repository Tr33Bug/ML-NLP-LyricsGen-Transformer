Ive never had this feeling before
Ive never wanted anyone more
And something in your eyes tells me
You feel the way that I do
I feel like you do 
If you would like to stay here all night
You know that I would say
Its all right
Though Im saying yes
I confess
Ive got more on my mind
Cause I want more of you
Than your time
All of you your body and soul
Every kind of love you can express
All the secret dreams youve never told
I want everything
And Ill take nothing less
All of you as long as you live
Everything youve never shared before
I want all of you that you can give
All your joys and all your sorrows
Your todays and your tomorrows
How I long to feel the warmth of your touch
And then if Im not asking too much
Id like to spend my life wandring through
All the wonders of you
And when were lying close in the dark
So close I feel each beat of your heart
I want you to reveal what you feel
All you hold deep inside
There is nothing I want you to hide
All of you your body and soul
Everything you want this love to be
I want all of you
All that you can give
And in return for all your giving
Let me give you all of me

All of you your body and soul
Every kind of love you can express
All the secret dreams youve never told
I want everything  everything  everything
All of you as long as you live
As long as you live 
Everything you want this love to be
I want all of you
All that you can give
In return  in return  I wanna give you
