You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying trying anything for you
Im in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I wanna get you where I can let you make all that love to me
Im on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there aint no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
We talk about love love love
We talk about love
We talk about love love love
We talk about love
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you swallow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you oh
You gotta plan your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying dying all you gotta do is
Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when youre lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love love love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
My arms will cover you all you gotta do
Get in the middle of a chain reaction  chain reaction 
You get a medal when youre lost in action  lost in action 
Dont pass me by
I wanna get your love all ready
For the sweet sensation instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover my lips will smother you
Sooner or later all you gotta do is
Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when youre lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready
For the sweet sensation instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
