Do you know where youre goin to
Do you like the things that life is showin you
Where are you goin to Do you know
Do you get what youre hopin for
When you look behind you theres no open doors
What are you hopin for Do you know
Once we were standin still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughin at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where youre goin to
Do you like the things that life is showin you
Where are you goin to Do you know
Now looking back at all weve planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be
Do you know where youre goin to
Do you like the things that life is showin you
Where are you goin to Do you know
Do you get what youre hopin for
When you look behind you theres no open doors
What are you hopin for Do you know
