Animal stalking you at night
Im a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe
Capture me my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstacy aint what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world
And you say
Thats impossible
Thats not impossible to do oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cause youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust you see
I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I dont ever wanna be
Eaten alive
Now I got you on the run
And the quicker my senses
And the chance is Im the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times
With a little stimulation
Itll come once more and you say
Thats impossible
Its not impossible to do oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cause youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see
I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I dont ever wanna be
Eaten alive
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cause youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see
I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Tie me to a tree crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave anything you say
I dont ever wanna be eaten alive
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cos youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust you see
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cos youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust you see
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cos youre dangerous
No more hearts I can trust you see
I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Tie me to a tree crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave anything you say
I dont ever wanna be eaten alive
