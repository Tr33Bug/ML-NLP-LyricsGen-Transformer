Good morning heartache
You old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
Thought we said goodbye last night
I tossed and turned
Until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish Id forget you
But youre here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now every day
I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache
Whats new
Stop haunting me now
Cant shake you no how
Just leave me alone
Ive got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues
Good morning heartache
Here we go again
Good morning heartache
Youre the one who knew me well
Might as well get used to you
Hangin around
Good morning heartache
Sit down
