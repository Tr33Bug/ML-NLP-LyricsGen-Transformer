Ingonyama nengw enamabala
Ingonyama nengw enamabala
Night and the spirit of life calling
Oh oh iyo mamela oh oh iyo
And the voice with the fear of a child answers
Oh oh iyo iyo mamela
Wait Theres no mountain too great
Hear these words and have faith
Oh oh iyo
Have faith
Hela hey mamela hela hey mamela
Hela hey mamela hela hey mamela
He lives in you he lives in me  hela hey mamela 
He watches over everything we see
Into the waters into the truth
In your reflection he lives in you
Dream and the voice in the wind whispers
Oh oh iyo iyo mamela oh oh iyo
Wait Theres no mountain too great
Hear these words and have faith
Oh oh iyo
He lives in you he lives in me
He watches over everything we see
Into the waters into the truth
In your reflection he lives in you
Ingonyama nengw enamabala
Ingonyama nengw enamabala
He lives in you he lives in me
He watches over everything we see
Into the water into the truth
In your reflection he lives in you
He lives in you  oh yeah  he lives in me
He watches over everything we see
Into the water into the truth
In your reflection he lives he lives he lives he lives in you
He lives he lives he lives in you
He watches over everything we see
