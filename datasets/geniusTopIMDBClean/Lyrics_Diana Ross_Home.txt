When I think of home I think of a place
Where theres love overflowing
I wish I was home I wish I was back there
With the things I been knowing
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin the scene makes it all clean
Maybe theres a chance for me to go back there
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where theres love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend let me start again
Suddenly my world has changed its face
But I still know where Im going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet Ive watched it growing
If youre listening God
Please dont make it hard to know
For us to believe in the things that we see
Tell us should we run away
Or should we try and stay
Or would it be better just to let things be
Living here in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So its real real to me
And Ive learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find a world full of love
Like yours like mine like home
