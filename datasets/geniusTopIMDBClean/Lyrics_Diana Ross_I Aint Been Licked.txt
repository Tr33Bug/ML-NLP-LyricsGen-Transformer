Roll down the gangway
So theyll see that its me
I know theyll wonder about my recovery
Yes I lost a love that promised happiness
What my heart wouldnt accept
Put me to the test
They keep a holding me down
But I rise
Yes it can be done
They keep a holding me down
But I rise
They cant make me run
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Got my second wind
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Tell em Im back again
Just say
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
Tell em for me
I aint been licked
Like outa nowhere my whole world fell apart
Till this day no one knows
What I felt in my heart
All those precious things
Inside me tried to still
Hands I thought would help
Pushed me over the hill
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Yes it can be done
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
They cant make me run
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Got my second wind
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Tell em Im back again
Just say
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
Tell em for me
I aint been licked
Keep a holding me down
But I rise
Just to start again
Rise
Show em that I can
Rise
Found a brand new dream
Rise
Just to prove one thing
Just say
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
Tell em for me
I aint been licked
I want the world to see
I aint been licked
Although my love is gone
I aint been licked
Somehow I carry one
I aint been licked
Ill find the strength somehow
I aint been licked
I think Im ready now
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
I aint been licked
