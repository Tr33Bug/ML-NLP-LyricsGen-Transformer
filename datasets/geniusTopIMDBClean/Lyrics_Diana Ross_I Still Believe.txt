In love I still believe
Its all I ever need
The reason that I breathe
I just cant get enough
An old familiar friend
Call it Heaven sent
It never has to end
I still believe in love
Love
Pulling me up whenever Im down
Giving me the faith I lost but now Ive found
Bringing me joy giving me life
Looking forward I can leave my past behind
Darling put your hands in mine
Were just having a good good time
Stepping out in a nw light
Were just having a good time  Good tim 
In love I still believe
Its all I ever need
The reason that I breathe
I just cant get enough
An old familiar friend
Call it Heaven sent
It never has to end
I still believe in love
Every smile every road
Theres a light that guides me everywhere I go
Through lonely nights it gets me close
Its in everything I know I know I know


Darling put your hands in mine
Were just having a good good time
Stepping out in a new light
Were just having a good time  Good time 
In love I still believe
Its all I ever need
The reason that I breathe
I just cant get enough
An old familiar friend
Call it Heaven sent
It never has to end
I still believe in love
Love
