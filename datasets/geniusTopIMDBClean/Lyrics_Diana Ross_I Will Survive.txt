This is dedicated to my girls
At first I was afraid I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
Then I spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so youre back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second youd be back to bother me
Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause youre not welcome anymore
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbyes
You think Id crumble
You think Id lay down and die
Oh no not I I will survive
For as long as I know how to love I know Ill stay alive
Ive got all my life to live
And Ive got all my love to give
Ill survive
I will survive
Hey hey
I I will survive 
Hey hey
I I will survive 
Every day
I I will survive 
Oh yeah
I I I I I I I I 


It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high
And you see me somebody new
Im not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now Im saving all my loving for someone whos loving me
Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
Youre not welcome anymore
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbyes
You think Id crumble
Did you think Id lay down and die
Oh no not I I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love I know Ill stay alive
Ive got all my life to live
And Ive got all my love to give
Ill survive
I will survive
Hey hey
Go now go walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause youre not welcome anymore
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbyes
Did you think Id crumble
Did you think Id lay down and die
Oh no not I I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love I know Ill stay alive
Ive got all my life to live
And Ive got all my love to give
Ill survive
I will survive
I will survive
I I will survive
