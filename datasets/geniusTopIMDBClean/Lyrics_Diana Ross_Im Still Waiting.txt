I remember when
I was five and you were ten boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you
Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said
Little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And Im still waiting
Im waiting
Ooh still waiting
Im just a fool
Ooh Im a fool
To keep waiting
For you
Im waiting
Ooh still waiting
Fot love
For you
Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said
Little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Little girl
Please dont wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And Im still waiting
Love has never shown his face
Since the day
You walked out that door
You filled my life with empty space
Come back
Cant you see its you Im waiting for
Dont you know Im waiting
Im waiting for love
For you
I miss you
Im waiting
Come on back boy
Come on back
Come on back
Come on back boy
I need you
I want you
Thats what my friends says
Oh buh huh
