Didnt know till today
That you would love for me to say
All of the things I feel
Though you dont doubt theyre real
Insecure very shy
Are the only reasons I have why
I never say the things that
You would love to hear
All the words I try
Disappoint me and I cry
So theyre words I dont often say
But its in my love its in my feeling
Its in the very same heart
That loved you from the start
Its in my heat its in the spirit
And its got me totally high
Its just hard me to say why
Kind of sad kind of blue
Because I wanted to tell you
That you are in my heart
Though we are far apart
Didnt know how to say
All the little things to make you stay
And not to keep assuming
You could read my mind
Youre the one I love
Though its hard for you to know
Cause the words I dont always say
But its in my love its in my feeling
Its in the very same heart
That loved you from the start
Its in the heat its in the spirit
And its got me totally high
Its just hard me to say why

Its hard for me
