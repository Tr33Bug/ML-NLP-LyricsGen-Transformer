Its my house and I live here
I wanna tell you 
Its my house and I live here
Theres a welcome mat at the door
And if you come on in
Youre gonna get much more
Theres my chair
I put it there
Everything you see
Is with love and care
Its my house and I live here
I wanna tell you 
Its my house and I live here
On the table there sits a rose
Through every window
A little light flows
Books of feeling on the shelf above
Cause it was built for love
I was built for love
Its my house and I live here
I wanna tell you 
Its my house and I live here
Theres a candle to light the stairs
Where my dreams await someone to share
Oh theres music on the radio
And good vibrations wont let me go
I put my name on the ceilin above
Cause it was buillt for love
It was built for love ooh
You say you wanna move in with me
You say you wanna move in with me
Got to follow the rules to get me
Got to follow the rules to get me
You wanna visit my house
Say you wanna drop by
Wanna visit my house yeah
To see me sometimes

Theres a welcome mat at the door
And if you come on in
Youre gonna get much more
I put my name in the ceilin above
Cause it was built for love
It was built for love
Its my house and I live here
I wanna tell you 
Its my house and I live here
