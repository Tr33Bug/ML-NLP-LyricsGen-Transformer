I cant cover up my feelings
In the name of love
Or play it safe
For a while that was easy
And if living for myself
Is what Im guilty of
Go on and sentence me
Ill still be free
Its my turn
To see what I can see
I hope youll understand
This times just for me
Because its my turn
With no apologies
Ive given up the truth
To those Ive tried to please
But now its my turn
If I dont have all the answers
At least I know
Ill take my share of chances
Aint no use of holding of
When nothing stays the same
So Ill let it rain
Cause the rain aint gonna hurt me
And Ill let you go
Though I know it wont be easy
Its my turn
With no more room for lies
For years Id seen my life
Through someone elses eyes
And now its my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least Ill own today
Its my turn
Yes its my turn
And there aint no use in holding of
When nothing stays the same
So Ill let it rain
Cause the rain aint gonna hurt me
And Ill let you go
Though I know it wont be easy
Its my turn
To see what I can see
I hope youll understand
This times just for me
Because its my turn
To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That youre still on my side
Because its my turn
Its my turn
Its my turn
To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage thats been done
But now its my turn
To reach and touch the sky
No ones gonna say
At least I didnt try
Its my turn
Yes its my turn
Its my turn
Its my turn
Its my turn
