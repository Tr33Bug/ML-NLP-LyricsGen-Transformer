I dont understand it cause you wont say yes
But you dont say no
You say you know we shouldnt you keep holding out
But you dont let go
Im giving up on trying
To sell you things that you aint buying
Its your move Ive made up my mind
Time is running out make a move
Oh we can go on do you understand
Its all in your hands its your move
Youre giving me the business with that old comeon
But you dont come across
You get me so excited dont you know youre such a tease
When I think youre getting hot youre not
So whats the problem Whats wrong
This kiss and miss you know it cant go on
Its your move Ive made up my mind
Time is running out make a move
Cause we cant go on I want you to know
Its your move your turn to go
Im giving up on trying
To sell you things that you aint buying
Its your move Ive made up my mind
Time is running out make a move
Oh we cant go on do you understand
Its all in your hands
Its your move Ive made up my mind
Time is running out make a move
Oh we cant go on do you understand
Its all in your hands
Its your move Ive made up my mind
Time is running out make a move
Oh we cant go on do you understand
Its all in your hands
Its your move Ive made up my mind
Time is running out
