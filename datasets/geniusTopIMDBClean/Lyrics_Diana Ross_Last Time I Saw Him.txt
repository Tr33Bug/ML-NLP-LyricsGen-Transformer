Last time I saw him
He sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him
He said Ill be back for more of this
Last time I saw him
We were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving
But he had to set us up
I gave him money
I know I invested well
Mamma doesnt trust him
But he loves me I can tell
Each day the greyhound
Arrives at nine o clock
But I dont start my crying
Til that last mans gotten off
Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhoundbound
But Im still waiting here
Without a fear
That bus will someday turn around
I had no letter
Its been six months maybe better
I try forgetting him
But I love him more then ever
I have decided
Ive waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong
He would return right on that bus
There must be trouble
So Im leavin on the double
If he cant get to me
I know he needs me desperately
Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said dont cry
Im coming back come rain or shine

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhoundbound
And as he waved goodbye
He said dont cry honey
Im coming back rain or shine hey
La de da la da do
Do la da da da da da
Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said dont cry
Im coming back come rain or shine
Da da la da da da da da
La da da da da da
Last time I saw him
He was greyhoundbound
