Sometimes we make each other cry
Sometimes were locked inside the prisons of our pride
Sometimes we break each others heart with the words we say
Let anger get in the way too many times
But always after all
Love is all that matters
After everything
One thing remains the same
One thing we cannot change oh
We all have one heart
And one heart needs another
Love love is all that matters
Love is all that matters
It matters after all
Sometimes we search this world for gold
When all we really need is just a hand to hold  To hold 
Sometimes we let the greatest treasure just slip away
With words we forget to say too many times
But always after all
Love is all that matters
After everything
One thing remains the same
One thing we cannot change oh
We we all have one heart
And one heart needs another
Love love is all that matters
Love is all that matters
It matters after all
After all that weve been through
It comes down to one simple truth
You need me I need you
Cause love is all that matters
Love is all that matters  Love is all that matters 
Love is all that matters  Love is all that matters 
It matters after all
Oh love is all that matters
Its the only thing that matters
It matters after all oh oh
Love is all that matters
