Since youve been away
Ive been down and lonely
Since youve been away
Ive been thinking of you
Trying to understand the reason you left me
What were you going through
Oooh oooh  Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Im missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Oooh oooh  Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Im missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
As I look around I see things that remind me
Just to see you smile made my heart filled with joy
I still recall all those dreams we shared together
Where did you run to boy
Oooh oooh  Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Im missing you
Tell me why the road turns   Tell me why the road turns 
Oooh oooh  Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Im missing you
Tell me why the road turns
Sometimes I wondered I didnt understand
Just where were you trying to go
Only you knew the plan
And I tried to be there but you wouldnt let me in
But now youve gone away boy
I feel so brokenhearted   Oh 
I knew the day we started that we were meant to be
If only youd let me
Ive cried so many tears   Oh 
Gotta face now all my fears   Oh oh 
We let time slip away
I need you boy here again
There was so much you gave me to my heart to my soul
There was so much of your dreams that were never told
You had so much hope for a brighter day
Why were you my flower plucked away
Oooh oooh  Im missing you 
Tell me why the road turns   Tell me why the road turns 
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh  Im missing you
Tell me why the road turns   Tell me why the road turns 
Tell me tell me why   Oooh oooh  Im missing you 
Tell me why the road turns   Tell me why the road turns 
Oh  Dont understand it   Oooh oooh Im missing you 
Oh oh  Oh oh oh oh oh   Tell me why the road turns 
Oooh oooh  Im missing you
Tell me why the road turns   Tell me why the road turns
