She said she wants a man
To always understand
But thats all right for her
Still it aint enough for me
She said she wants a guy
To keep her satisfied
But thats all right for her
But it aint enough for me
Still I dont care if hes young or old
Just make him beautiful 
I just want someone I can hold on to
I want muscles
All all over his body
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes 
I want muscles
All all over his body
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes 
They say they have to see
His real personality
But thats alright for them
Still it aint enough for me
I need what the eyes can see ah
His anatomy 
If thats alright for them
Still it aint enough for me
I dont care if hes young or old
Just make him beautiful
I just want some strong man to hold on to
I want muscles
All all over his body
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes 
I want muscles
All over his body
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes 

Muscle man I want to love you
In the sun Oil on your body
Come with me high in the cascades
Let this be weve got this thing made
Lost at sea hot in the desert
Stay with me you wont regret it
Take this love so deep to swim in
Come to me and let the love in
She said she wants a man
To always understand
But thats alright for her
Still it aint enough for me
I dont care if hes young or old
Just make him beautiful 
I just want someone I can hold on to
I want muscles
All all over his body
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes 
I want muscles
All over him all over him
I want muscles
All all over his body
I want muscles
I want all I can get
All over him all over him
I want muscles muscles muscles
