Love is called
My old piano
I have a ball
With my old piano
My baby entertains
The real life of my parties
But still retains
In all the dignity
His international style
Exudes an air of royalties
His eighty eight key smile
Is so pleasant to see
Love is called
My old piano
I have a ball
With my old piano
My old keyboard
Wont stand for a corner
He demands the middle of the room
Your heart disolves
While he tips you so gracefully
Till youre involved
In a babygrand affair
Love is called
My old piano
I have a ball
With my old piano
Love is called
My old piano
I have a ball
With my old piano
He entertains
The real life of my parties
But still retains
In all the dignity
His international style
Exudes an air of royalties
His eighty eight key smile
Is so pleasant to see
My old keyboard
Wont stand for a corner
He demands the middle of the room
Your heart disolves
While he tips you so gracefully
Till youre involved
In a babygrand affair
Love is called
My old piano
I have a ball
With my old piano
Love is called
My old piano
I have a ball
With my old piano
