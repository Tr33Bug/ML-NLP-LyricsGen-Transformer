Reach Out and Touch  Somebodys Hand  Lyrics
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Just try 
Take a little time out of your busy day
To give encouragement
To someone whos lost the way
Just try 
Or would I be talking to a stone
If I asked you
To share a problem thats not your own
We can change things if we start giving
Why dont you
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Just try 
If you see an old friend on the street
And hes down
Remember his shoes could fit your feet
Just try 
Try a little kindness
Youll see
Its something that comes very naturally
We can change things if we start giving
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
