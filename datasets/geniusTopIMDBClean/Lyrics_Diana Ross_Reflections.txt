Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me
Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
Oh Im all alone now
No love to sheild me
Trapped in a world
Thats a distorted reality
Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories
Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that Ive cried
Reflects the hurt I cant control
Cause although youre gone
I keep holding on
To the happy time
Ooh when you were mine
As I peer through window of lost time
Looking over my yesterday
And the love I gave all in vain
All the love  All the love that Ive wasted
All the tears  All the tears that Ive tasted
All in vain
Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream thats lost
From the hurt
That you have caused
Everywhere I turn
Its like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be
In you I put all my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world had turned to dust
After all the nights I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises are all thats left of loving you
Reflections of the way life used to be
Reflections of the love you took from me
In you I put all my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
