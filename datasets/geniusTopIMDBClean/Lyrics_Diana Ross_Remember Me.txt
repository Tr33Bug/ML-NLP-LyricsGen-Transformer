Remember Me Lyrics
Bye baby
See you around
Didn't I tell you
I wouldn't hold you down
Take good care of yourself, y'hear
Don't let me hear about you shedding a tear
You're gonna make it
You're gonna take it
Remember me as a sunny day
That you once had
Along the way
Didn't I inspire you a little higher
Remember me as a funny clown
That made you laugh when you were down
Didn't I, boy?
Didn't I, boy?
Remember me as a big balloon
At a carnival that ended too soon
Remember me as a breath of spring
Remember me as a good thing

Bye baby
See you around
I already know
About the new love you've found
What can I do but wish you well
What we had was really swell
I won't forget it, I have no regrets
You might also like
Remember me as a sound of laughter
And my face the morning after
Didn't the sky beckon us to fly?
Yes, you'l remember the times we fought
But don't forget me in your tender thoughts
Please, darlin'
Oh yeah
Remember me when you drink the wine
Of sweet success and I gave you my best
Remember me with every song you sing
Remember me as a good thing
Remember me as a sunny day
Please darling
Remember me as a good thing
Remember me when you drink the wine
Remember me as a good thing
Remember me as a big balloon
Don't forget me, darling1Embed
