Bye baby
See you around
Didnt I tell you
I wouldnt hold you down
Take good care of yourself yhear
Dont let me hear about you shedding a tear
Youre gonna make it
Youre gonna take it
Remember me as a sunny day
That you once had
Along the way
Didnt I inspire you a little higher
Remember me as a funny clown
That made you laugh when you were down
Didnt I boy
Didnt I boy
Remember me as a big balloon
At a carnival that ended too soon
Remember me as a breath of spring
Remember me as a good thing
Bye baby
See you around
I already know
About the new love youve found
What can I do but wish you well
What we had was really swell
I wont forget it I have no regrets


Remember me as a sound of laughter
And my face the morning after
Didnt the sky beckon us to fly
Yes youl remember the times we fought
But dont forget me in your tender thoughts
Please darlin
Oh yeah
Remember me when you drink the wine
Of sweet success and I gave you my best
Remember me with every song you sing
Remember me as a good thing
Remember me as a sunny day
Please darling
Remember me as a good thing
Remember me when you drink the wine
Remember me as a good thing
Remember me as a big balloon
Dont forget me darling
