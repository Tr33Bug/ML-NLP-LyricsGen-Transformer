Someday well be together
Say say say it again
Someday well be together
Oh yeah oh yeah
Youre far away

And just as sure my my baby
As there are stars above
I wanna say I wanna say I wanna say
Someday well be together
Yes we will yes we will
Say someday  some sweet day  well be together

Oh right from the stars
You you you posses my soul now honey
And I know I know you own my heart

Now now all I wanna do is cry cry
Hey hey hey

Just to kiss your sweet sweet lips
Hold you ever ever so tight
And I wanna say

Someday well be together
Yes we will yes we will
