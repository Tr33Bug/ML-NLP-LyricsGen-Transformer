Part 1 Soon As I Get Home
Miss one
Theres a feeling here inside
That I cannot hide
And I know Ive tried
But its turnin me around
Im not sure that im aware
If Im up or down or here or there
I need both feet on the ground
Maybe Im just goin crazy
Lettin myself get uptight
Im actin just like a baby
But Im gonna be
Im gonna be alright
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Part 2 Home
In a different place in a different time
Different people around me
I would like to know of that different world
And how different they find me
And just whats a Wiz
Is he big Will he scare me
If I ask to leave
Will the Wiz even hear me
How will I know then
If Ill ever get home again
Here I am alone
Though it feels the same
I dont know where Im goin
Im here on my own and its not a game
And a strange wind is blowin
Im so amazed at the things that I see here
Dont want to be afraid
I just dont want to be afraid
I just dont want to be here
In my mind this is clear
What am I doin here
I wish I was home
I wish I wish
I wish I wish
