I was lying there
Lying on the beach
I dreamed you were there
Feel the heat
The sun and the waves
When you touch my hand
We were on a desert island
And I had a dream
I was swept away
You and I are on an island
Where I thought the storm would never end
I saw your light on the horizon
And I knew that I was blown away again
No it doesnt matter
Yeah it doesnt matter
Cause nothing lasts forever
Cause nothing last forever
No it doesnt matter
No it doesnt matter
Cause nothing lasts forever
Nothing last forever
I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you
I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you
The rise and fall is endless
The risk you run of being lost in blue
You caught my drift while I was restless
When the current flows
Im gonna flow with you


No it doesnt matter
Yeah it doesnt matter
Cause nothing last forever
Nothing last forever
No it doesnt matter
No it doesnt matter
Cause nothing last forever
Nothing last forever
I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you
I was swept away
I was swept away
I was swept away with you
For a day
Or maybe for a lifetime
Break away
Is he throwing me a lifeline
If I say
That this will be the last time
Swept away
Will it end with you
I was swept away
Swept away
Swept away
No it wont no it wont
No it doesnt matter
Nothing last forever
