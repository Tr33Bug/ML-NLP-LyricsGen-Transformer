Take me to that place
Higher
Go hold on
Go
Take me higher 
Take me higher 
In my mind I see the possibilities
When it comes to love there are no boundaries
Do you think that you and I can work it out
Thats what true loves about
Baby we can find an answer if we look inside our hearts
Love will be there waiting for us
Baby we can rise above it if we leave our doubts behind us
We can learn to fly high above us
Theres a place up in the sky
Where the sun is shining
Take me higher
Take me higher 
Theres a place I long to be
Where the birds are flying
Take me higher
Take me higher 
See it on the news theres trouble eveywhere
Gotta reach out show somebody that you care
It aint good to let the bad news get us down
Lets spread some love around
Even if you want to go there
To a place above the clouds
Got to feel the power of love  power of love 
Baby we can rise above it if we leave our doubts behind
We can learn to fly high above us
Theres a place up in the sky
Where the sun is shining
Take me higher
Take me higher 
Theres a place I long to be
Where the birds are flying
Take me higher
Take me higher 
repeat 
You gotta reach out
Feel the power of love
Show somebody you care
Take me
Oh baby
Higher
Take me higher
Theres a place up in the sky
Where the sun is shining
Take me higher
Take me higher 
Theres a place I long to be
Where the birds are flying
Take me higher
Take me higher 
repeat 
Take me higher
Take me take me
Take me higher
Take me higher 
repeat three times 
Theres a place up in the sky
Where the sun is shining
Take me higher
Take me higher 
Theres a place I long to be
I want to go flying
Take me higher
