Every choice and step I make
Every word and breath I take
Youre the reason my world keeps turning
Like the blood running through my veins
Sunshine when theres only rain
Youre the reason my heart keeps learning
I will never let go of that feeling
Cause loving you it makes me feel strong
And when I feel the pain you are my healing
And I know beside you is where I belong
Cause loving feels like that feels like that woah
It will lift you up when that is what you need
Loving feels like that feels like that woah
I thank God that it is you whos loving me hey
Thank you for thank you for that  I just wanna say 
Thank you for thank you for that  Thank you for the love 
Thank you for thank you for that  I just wanna say thank you 
Thank you for thank you for that  Thank you for my life 
We survived the highs and lows
Sometimes thats how life goes
But together I know well make it
I wouldnt change a single day
No one else makes me feel that way
I know youll take care of my heart and never break it
I will never let go of that feeling
Cause loving you it makes me feel strong
And when I feel the pain you are my healing
And I know beside you is where I belong hey
Loving feels like that feels like that woah
It will lift you up when that is all you need
Loving feels like that feels like that woah
