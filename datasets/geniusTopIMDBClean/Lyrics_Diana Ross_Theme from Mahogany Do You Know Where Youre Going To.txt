Theme from Mahogany  Do You Know Where Youre Going To  Lyrics
Do you know where youre going to
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know
Do you get what youre hoping for
When you look behind you theres no open doors
What are you hoping for
Do you know
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where youre going to
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know
Now looking back at all weve passed
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be
Do you know where youre going to
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know
Do you get what youre hoping for
When you look behind you theres no open doors
What are you hoping for
Do you know
