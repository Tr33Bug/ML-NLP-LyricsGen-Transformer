Touch me in the mornin
Then just walk away
We dont have tomorrow
But we had yesterday
Hey wasnt it me who said
That nothin goods gonna last forever
And wasnt it me who said
Lets just be glad for the time together
It mustve been hard to tell me
That youve given all you had to give
I can understand your feelin that way
Everybodys got their life to live
Well I can say goodbye
In the cold mornin light
But I cant watch love die
In the warmth of the night
If Ive got to be strong
Dont you know I need to
Have tonight when youre gone
Til you go I need to
Lie here and think about
The last time that youll
Touch me in the mornin
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me
Empty like before
Hey wasnt it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us
Didnt we run away and hope
That time wouldnt try to find us
Didnt we run 
Didnt we take each other
To a place where no ones ever been
Yeah I really need you near me tonight
Cause youll never take me there again


Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
Weve seen how love can grow
Now well see how it dies
If Ive got to be strong
Dont you know I need to
Have tonight when youre gone
Til you go I need to
Hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and
Touch me in the mornin
In the mornin 
Were blue and gold
And we could feel one another livin
Then just walk away 
We walked with a dream to hold
And we could take what the world was givin
We dont have tomorrow 
Theres no tomorrow here
Theres only love and the time to chase it
But we had yesterday 
Yesterdays gone my love
Theres only now and its time to face it
Touch me in the mornin
