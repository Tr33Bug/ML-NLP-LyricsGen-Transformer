Until We Meet Again Lyrics
Who would have ever thought
The day could ever come
When we would see
A love like this fall into pieces

And it hurts me to know that now 'til then
I'll only have these memories, hey

And now there's no time left to pretend
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go
There's no way we can be friends
But you're always part of me
Until we meet again
Why while our love was strong
We still couldn't make it
Did time have to take our lives in different directions

And it hurts 'cause there's no way for me to reach you
We're so far apart
When did we grow so far apart? Oh

And now there's no time left to pretend
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go
There's no way we can be friends
(No way we can be friends)
But you're always part of me
Until we meet again

Oh, deep in my heart I know
I'll see you again
Well I don't know where or when
But 'til then, oh
You might also like
And now there's no time left to pretend
(There's no time, there's no time to pretend)
And it feels like it's the end
(It feels like it's the end)
But you're always in my heart, ooh
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go (Let you go)
There's no way we can be friends
(There's no way, no way)
But you're always part of me (Part of me)
Until we meet again
And now there's no time left to pretend
(There's no time, there's no time)
And it feels like it's the end
(It feels like it's the end)
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go
(Let you go, let you go)
There's no way we can be friends
(There's no way, no way)
But you're always part of me
Until we meet again
And now there's no time left to pretend
(There's no time, there's no time left to pretend)
And it feels like it's the end
But you're always in my heart
Until we meet againEmbed
