Who would have ever thought
The day could ever come
When we would see
A love like this fall into pieces
And it hurts me to know that now til then
Ill only have these memories hey
And now theres no time left to pretend
And it feels like its the end
But youre always in my heart
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go
Theres no way we can be friends
But youre always part of me
Until we meet again
Why while our love was strong
We still couldnt make it
Did time have to take our lives in different directions
And it hurts cause theres no way for me to reach you
Were so far apart
When did we grow so far apart Oh
And now theres no time left to pretend
And it feels like its the end
But youre always in my heart
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go
Theres no way we can be friends
No way we can be friends 
But youre always part of me
Until we meet again
Oh deep in my heart I know
Ill see you again
Well I dont know where or when
But til then oh
And now theres no time left to pretend
Theres no time theres no time to pretend 
And it feels like its the end
It feels like its the end 
But youre always in my heart ooh
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go  Let you go 
Theres no way we can be friends
Theres no way no way 
But youre always part of me  Part of me 
Until we meet again
And now theres no time left to pretend
Theres no time theres no time 
And it feels like its the end
It feels like its the end 
But youre always in my heart
Until we meet again
Now I have to let you go
Let you go let you go 
Theres no way we can be friends
Theres no way no way 
But youre always part of me
Until we meet again
And now theres no time left to pretend
Theres no time theres no time left to pretend 
And it feels like its the end
But youre always in my heart
Until we meet again
