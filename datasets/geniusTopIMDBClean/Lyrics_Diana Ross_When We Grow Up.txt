When we grow up will I be pretty
Will you be big and strong
Will I wear dresses that show off my knees
Will you wear trousers twice as long
Well I dont care if Im pretty at all
And I dont care if you never get tall
I like what I look like and youre nice small
We dont have to change at all
Hey
When we grow up will I be a lady
Will you be an engineer
Will I have to wear things like perfume and gloves
I can still pull the whistle while you steer
Well I dont care if Im pretty at all
And I dont care if you never get tall
I like what I look like and youre nice small
We dont have to change at all
When I grow up Im gonna be happy and do what I like to do
Like making noise and making faces and making friends like you
And when we grow up do you think well see
That Im still like you and youre still like me
I might be pretty you might grow tall
But we dont have to change at all
Spoken I dont want to change see cause I still want to be your friend forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
