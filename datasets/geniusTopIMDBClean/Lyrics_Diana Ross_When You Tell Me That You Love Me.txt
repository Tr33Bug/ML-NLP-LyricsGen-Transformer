I wanna call the stars
Down from the sky
I wanna live a day
That never dies
I wanna change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I wanna do
I wanna hold you close
Under the rain
I wanna kiss your smile
And feel the pain
I know whats beautiful
Looking at you
In a world of lies
You are the truth
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
Ill make you safe
No matter where you are
And bring you
Everything you ask for
Nothing is above me
Im shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
I wanna make you see
Just what I was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everythings easy now
I have you here
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
Ill make you safe
No matter where you are
And bring you
Everything you ask for
Nothing is above me
Im shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me

In a world without you
I would always hunger
All I need is your love to make me stronger
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
Ill make you safe
No matter where you are
And bring you
Everything you ask for
Nothing is above me
Im shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
You love me
When you tell me that you love me
