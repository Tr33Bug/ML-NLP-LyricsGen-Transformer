Sometimes when Im sitting all alone
I think of things that I have done
And start to wonder if theres one thing
That means more than others I have known
And suddenly its clear to me
Without your love where would I be
Your love has kept me going
Through good and bad times
Its kept me growing
Like a steady flame
Your love has kept on burning
Through sweet and sad times
Ill keep returning to the magic of your love
Through the years my dreams may come and go
For fortune is a fleeting time
And no one knows what time may bring
But through the highs and lows of it Ill know
That theres one thing of which Im sure
The one thing Ive been living for
Your love has kept me going
Through good and bad times
Its kept me growing
Like a steady flame
Your love has kept on burning
Through sweet and sad times
Ill keep returning to the magic of your love
Your love has kept me going
Through good and bad times
Its kept me growing
Like a steady flame
Your love has kept on burning
Through sweet and sad times
Ill keep returning to the magic of your love
Ill keep returning to the magic of your love
Your love
