TranslationsEspañolPortuguês2AM Lyrics[Chorus]
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Call my phone like you needed somethin'
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Beatin' on your back like you owe me some'

[Verse 1]
Go run it back and tell the news, news, news
Lil' buddy mad I got it lose or somethin'
Pulled up, or are you way too cool?
You in the house gettin' loose or somethin'
Drive me under (Yeah), make me wonder (Yeah)
Flight to London, oh, yeah
Drive me under, make mе wonder
Flight to London, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to rеlax at the crib, lil' baby
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Call my phone like you needed somethin'
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Beatin' on your back like you owe me some'

[Verse 2]
I just spent three long summers (I just spent three long)
Tryna get you back in the house, girl, cuddle (Girl, cuddle)
Tryna get you back in the house for the double up (Double up)
Hit you from the back watch how that booty bubble up
Yeah, best friend watch me juggle her, baddie
Get in the bed, baby, snuggle up, I'm daddy
Ride around fully loaded and it's automatic (Fully loaded)
You should see the catty skrrt, it got a fatty

[Chorus]
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Two in the morning, okay
Hard to relax at the crib, lil' baby
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Call my phone like you needed somethin'
Know I'm goin' in, okay
Beatin' on your back like you owe me some'
