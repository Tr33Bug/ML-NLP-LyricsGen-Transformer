Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh (Yeah-yeah)

[Chorus]
I don't go for no type of bogus shit (Ah)
She just wanna take a picture (Ah-ah), strike a pose with it
Twenty-five hundred on my bitch, she stole it (Yeah-yeah)
Woah, yo (Ooh)
Double decker, hoes in it
They know I'm for sure, they knock on my door with it
Donny on the road, couple bowls, I'm gone, get in it
They gon' go-go crazy, I'm out the door with it, yeah (Ooh, yeah)
'Til it's over ('Til it's over)
'Til it's over ('Til it's over)
'Til it's over ('Til it's over)
'Til it's over ('Til it's over)
[Verse]
It's another day, on another plane, on another flight (Uh-uh)
Now pull up, keep the door open, I'm going tonight (Yeah-yeah)
When I tried to fall in love with you, wasn't seemin' right
Wasn't seemin' right (Wasn't seemin' right)
Speed off in the Lambo', you hear the pipes bust
I just wanna hit her here for one night, 'cause
Going off with lil' shawty like a robbery, woah
Why would I waste my time if you ain't got time for me, woah
Two tone Patek (Shut up)
Two tone at yo' neck (Ah, haha)
Know I need respect (Woah)
Know I need respect (Woah)
You know I need my money, a hundred thousand checks (Uh huh)
I might call Zoey Dollaz and ride straight through the 'jects
I'm out in Florida, huh, blowin' that back, I'm blowin' it, huh
By the time my fit is on, cross that line, that border, huh
I gotta go fill me up (Fill me up)
Fill me up (Fill me up)
The border, huh

[Chorus]
I don't go for no type of bogus shit (Ah)
She just wanna take a picture (Ah-ah), strike a pose with it
Twenty-five hundred on my bitch, she stole it (Yeah-yeah)
Woah, yo (Ooh)
Double decker, hoes in it
They know I'm for sure, they knock on my door with it
Donny on the road, couple bowls, I'm gone, get in it
They gon' go-go crazy, I'm out the door with it, yeah (Ooh, yeah)
'Til it's over ('Til it's over)
'Til it's over ('Til it's over)
'Til it's over ('Til it's over)
