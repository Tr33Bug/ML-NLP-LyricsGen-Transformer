Back Up Lyrics[Chorus: Don Toliver & Wiz Khalifa]
Ohh, I had to get back up (Back up)
I had to get back up
Yeah, I can't take no loss (Mhm)
You better call back up
I really be down to finish
I don't play get down and get it
Talk 'bout that come slide, I'm with it
Niggas see me now, on God I'm litty
I know that you tryna go big
Better run up the cash, I love to spend
Better kill it and did it again
I'm ready in 10 know I'm down to win
I can't feel bad about it (Uh-uh)
I know you sad about it
Know you sad about it (Okay!)
Know you sad about it (Uh)
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I just got bags from Prada
Rolling up marijuana
I'm in a brand new model
It'll be here tomorrow
I don't got fears or problems
Only got real ones round him
Only got P's and ounces
It took a week to count it
Then I re-back up
Name the place and we back up
Running these racks up
Hunnid mills what we after
Dying from laughter, when it comes to hand outs never had one
Smoke with a bad one
Made a mill today, It ain't my last one

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Wiz Khalifa]
Ohh, I had to get back up (Back up)
I had to get back up
Yeah, I can't take no loss (Mhm)
You better call back up
I really be down to finish
I don't play get down and get it
Talk 'bout that come slide, I'm with it
Niggas see me now, on God I'm litty
I know that you tryna go big
Better run up the cash, I love to spend
Better kill it and did it again
I'm ready in 10 know I'm down to win
I can't feel bad about it (Uh-uh)
I know you sad about it
Know you sad about it (Okay!)
Know you sad about it (Uh)

I'm moving too fast, I can't stop
Wiping it down when the paint hot
Left hand on the wheel
I'm closing the top when the rain drop
I'm keeping the game in a headlock
When [?] the block, they my dreadlock
In the endzone, with the man down
One phone call, get it dead stop
I feel like I own the season
Say one thing, just give me a reason
Know you're mad, I'm undefeated
Top dog, making it even

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Wiz Khalifa]
Ohh, I had to get back up (Back up)
I had to get back up
Yeah, I can't take no loss (Mhm)
You better call back up
I really be down to finish
I don't play get down and get it
Talk 'bout that come slide, I'm with it
Niggas see me now, on God I'm litty
I know that you tryna go big
Better run up the cash, I love to spend
Better kill it and did it again
I'm ready in 10 know I'm down to win
I can't feel bad about it (Uh-uh)
I know you sad about it
Know you sad about it (Okay!)
Know you sad about it (Uh)3Embed
