Dying from laughter when it comes to hand outs never had one
Smoke with a bad one

Wiping it down when the paint hot
Left hand on the wheel
Im closing the top when the rain drop

When  the block they my dreadlock
In the endzone with the man down
One phone call get it dead stop

Say one thing just give me a reason

Top dog making it even
