Bang Bang Lyrics[Intro: Nancy Sinatra]
Ayy, Ramy, light up another blunt, bruh
Bang, bang, I hit the ground, bang, bang

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
She shot me down, bang, bang (Fuck), I could fuck now, bang, bang
I ride around, switch lanes, rep the gang, bang, bang (Uh)
H-Town, swang, bang, sippin' on codeine ('Deine)
Y'all don't know what I been through
She shot me down, bang, bang (Fuck), I could fuck now, bang, bang
I ride around, switch lanes, rep the gang, bang, bang (Uh)
H-Town, swang, bang, sippin' on codeine ('Deine)
Y'all don't know what I been through
[Verse 1: Don Toliver]
I'm lookin' through Donny's vision, I'm aimin' it with precision (Yeah)
I'm cookin' in Hells' Kitchen, I made the devil wash the dishes
Niggas greedy, niggas envy, pocket watchin', tryna get me (Uh-huh)
Niggas hella iffy, they contemplate snitchin'
Get in your bag for once, you don't do it enough
Hate to sound so tall, but I'm six digits up
You shot me down, now you really wanna fuck
Her head in the pillow while a nigga beat it up

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
She shot me down, bang, bang (Fuck), I could fuck now, bang, bang
I ride around, switch lanes, rep the gang, bang, bang (Uh)
H-Town, swang, bang, sippin' on codeine ('Deine)
Y'all don't know what I been through
She shot me down, bang, bang (Fuck), I could fuck now, bang, bang
I ride around, switch lanes, rep the gang, bang, bang (Uh)
H-Town, swang, bang, sippin' on codeine ('Deine)
Y'all don't know what I been through

[Verse 2: Don Toliver]
I pull up real fast and I talk a lot of cash
I finesse, she in it bad, she can get it, I'ma smash
She so wide body, let fit well in the back
Stackin' cash until I'm through, sellin' pack, that what I do
Empty the clip if you talkin' down
I done smashed all these hoes all around the town
I done hit one, passed one, pulled up in a digital dash one
Left her in a bag like the last one

She shot me down, bang, bang (Fuck), I could fuck now, bang, bang
I ride around, switch lanes, rep the gang, bang, bang (Uh)
H-Town, swang, bang, sippin' on codeine ('Deine)
Y'all don't know what I been through
She shot me down, bang, bang (Fuck), I could fuck now, bang, bang
I ride around, switch lanes, rep the gang, bang, bang (Uh)
H-Town, swang, bang, sippin' on codeine ('Deine)
Y'all don't know what I been through1Embed
