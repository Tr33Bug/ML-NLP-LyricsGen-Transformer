I had to sit you down to talk about it
It shows me a lot from your silence
You told all your friends that Im violent
But you can quit the cap know you lyin
I had to beat it up to stay inside
And your tears are happiness the way you cry
I keep a couple Xans up in my ride
I know you want it all but its all mine
Ohohohoh

I cant feel my legs  Legs 
I cant feel my
Ohohohoh
I cant feel my legs  Legs 
I cant feel my legs  Legs

Let me tell you bout a story bout a couple of Xans
I was fuckin round in Houston with a couple of fans
But excuse me they was groupies they was not in the plan
Either way we popped pills and we all held hands
I had to sit you down to talk about it
It shows me a lot from your silence
You told all your friends that Im violent
But you can quit the cap know you lyin
I had to beat it up to stay inside
And your tears are happiness the way you cry
I keep a couple Xans up in my ride
I know you want it all but its all mine

I had to sit you down to talk about it
It shows me a lot from your silence
You told all your friends that Im violent
But you can quit the cap know you lyin
I had to beat it up to stay inside
And your tears are happiness the way you cry
I keep a couple Xans up in my ride
I know you want it all but its all mine
