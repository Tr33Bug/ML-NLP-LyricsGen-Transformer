TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDouble Standards Lyrics[Intro: Lil Jack]
See I love me a groupie bitch
See I love me a groupie bitch
The way they turn on my back, got haters and they on my back
See I love me a groupie bitch
See I love me a groupie bitch
The way they turn on my back, got haters and they on my back

[Verse 1]
It's so hard to be human
It's so hard to just live and learn with all of your mistakes
It's double standards on all this (Ooh-ooh)
It's got you movin' with caution
That's what had you, they start talkin', sayin' you out way too often
With some friends that got some history of only baller hoppin'
Look at me, I ain't so flawless, had like twenty girls in Austin
It's like three or four a week (Yeah), I'm roundin' up, at least I'm honest
[Chorus]
No one changes over night
Thеy were lonely yеars, they were hard to fight
Fairytales don't come overnight
Gotta work for it, work for it
I see, I see you, baby, I do

[Verse 2]
They only see you (Only see you) for what you're worth (What you're worth)
That's not what I see when you in my face, yeah
That's not what I see when you at my place, yeah
That's not what I see, girl, you know you—

[Interlude: Lil Jack]
See I love me a groupie bitch
See I love me a groupie bitch
The way they turn on my back, got haters and they on my back
See I love me a groupie bitch
See I love me a groupie bitch
The way they turn on my back, got haters and they on my back

[Verse 3]
Is it so hard to do what you came to do? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Donny's got a hold on you
And I know you rather lie here than tell the truth (Yeah)
Well, I guess they out there talkin' 'bout some bitches I don't know about
I'm pressed 'bout you, better pull up with that room key
I'm pressed 'bout you
Ain't really into no small talk
I'm really outta your ball park
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You think it's way too easy
You'll never believe me
Life come back in full circle (Ooh, yeah)
I'm like whatever it is, I don't really need it
That right there, just might hurt you
