TranslationsPortuguêsDrugs N Hella Melodies Lyrics[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Sex full of adrenaline
This pussy put you right to sleep just like a sedative
Not to sound conceited, I'm not one to brag
But I'm the girl you needed that you never had
Some people only see the negative
Some people find a way to see the good in everything
I just wanna see you through the good and bad
Take you as you are and never give you back

[Refrain: Don Toliver]
No place I can't go (No place I can't go)
Love ain't here, no (Love ain't here, no)
Drugs and hella melodies
[Verse 1: Don Toliver]
On the ocean and it's private
Diamonds blingin', diamonds blindin'
Are you open for the timing?
See you dressed in designer, hold your mileage
Don't give it up, don't give it up, up
Don't give it, don't give it up
Don't give it up

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Sex full of adrenaline
This pussy put you right to sleep just like a sedative
Not to sound conceited, I'm not one to brag
But I'm the girl you needed that you never had
Some people only see the negative
Some people find a way to see the good in everything
I just wanna see you through the good and bad
Take you as you are and never give you back

[Verse 2: Don Toliver]
Caught my eye, I love your intellect (Intellect)
I guess I'll put you straight to sleep, I call it bed rest (Bed rest)
I just want your body like I never had (I just want your body like I—)
Take you out the house and never bring you back
Free my mind, you know what I'm into, yeah
Spend all days off in LA, I guess you into that (Into that)
I just wanna love you like a hundred racks (I just wanna love you, love you)
Take you out of town and never bring you back (Out of town and love you)

No place I can't go (No place I can't go)
Love ain't here, no (Love ain't here, no)
