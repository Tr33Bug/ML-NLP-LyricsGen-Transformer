Sex full of adrenaline
This pussy put you right to sleep just like a sedative
Not to sound conceited Im not one to brag
But Im the girl you needed that you never had
Some people only see the negative
Some people find a way to see the good in everything
I just wanna see you through the good and bad
Take you as you are and never give you back
No place I cant go  No place I cant go 
Love aint here no  Love aint here no 
Drugs and hella melodies
On the ocean and its private
Diamonds blingin diamonds blindin
Are you open for the timing
See you dressed in designer hold your mileage
Dont give it up dont give it up up
Dont give it dont give it up
Dont give it up
Sex full of adrenaline

Take you out of town and never bring you back  Out of town and love you

Love aint here no  Love aint here no
