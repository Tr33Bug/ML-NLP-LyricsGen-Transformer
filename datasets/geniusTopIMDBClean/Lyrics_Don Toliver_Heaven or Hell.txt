Well, what brings you to church this evenin'?
Fightin' love, fightin' hate or you're fightin' your demons?
Mama tried to talk to you, wouldn't kee— keep it
Sad story, if I had to shoot 'em bet it's Robert Horry
I know you can get comfortable with it
I hit the road and had to double up my digits (Woah)
My car is push-to-start, like, can you dig it?
Put it in the driveway, my key in your ignition
I know it get hot as hell
But you'll be a bad one, I wanna smoke some
I know it get hotter, yeah
I wanna smoke some

Ooh, yeah, I wanna smoke some (I wanna smoke some)
Take me to your house and let me poke some (Ooh)

Lean in my orange soda, I'm Kenan and Kel (Woah)
And in my own corners, I trap out the mail (Uh-huh)
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout and fuck your lil' scale
