Lemonade (Original) Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
The bitches they hate and you can't miss what you never had
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Off the juice (Juice), codeine got me tripping (Juice)
Copped the Coupe (Coupe), woke up, roof was missing (Yeah, yeah)
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
[Verse 1]
Why (Yeah, yeah, yeah), Why
Why you want to waste my time
I can tell you really hate your life
Bitch your watch the same as mine (Oh yeah)
I can't relate, designer frames, I'm blind today (Oh, oh)
I'm never late, the money calling, you need space

[Pre-Chorus]
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
The bitches they hate and you can't miss what you never had
(Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Off the juice (Juice), codeine got me tripping (Juice)
Copped the Coupe (Coupe), woke up, roof was missing (Yeah, yeah)
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (Ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
