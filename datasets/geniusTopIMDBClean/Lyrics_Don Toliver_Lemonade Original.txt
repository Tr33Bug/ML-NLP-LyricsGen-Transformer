Lemonade  Original  Lyrics
Xanny bars suicide door brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life so much money itll make you laugh hey
The bitches they hate and you cant miss what you never had

Copped the Coupe  Coupe  woke up roof was missing  Yeah yeah 
Ice  Ice  lemonade my neck was drippin

Xanny bars suicide door brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs

The bitches they hate and you cant miss what you never had
