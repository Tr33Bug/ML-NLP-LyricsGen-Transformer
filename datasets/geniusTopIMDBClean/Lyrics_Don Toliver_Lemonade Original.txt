Lemonade  Original  Lyrics
Xanny bars suicide door brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life so much money itll make you laugh hey
The bitches they hate and you cant miss what you never had
Hey hey 
Off the juice  Juice  codeine got me tripping  Juice 
Copped the Coupe  Coupe  woke up roof was missing  Yeah yeah 
Ice  Ice  lemonade my neck was drippin
Ice  Ice  lemonade my neck was drippin
Why  Yeah yeah yeah  Why
Why you want to waste my time

Xanny bars suicide door brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
Rockstar life so much money itll make you laugh hey
The bitches they hate and you cant miss what you never had
Hey hey

Copped the Coupe  Coupe  woke up roof was missing  Yeah yeah

Xanny bars suicide door brand new bag
College girls give a nigga head in my Rafs
