Main Attraction Lyrics[Intro]
I'm out in L.A. and I'm ballin'
I know you see me, I'm too Austin
CardoGotWings
I know I fuck her way too often, often

[Chorus]
It's a main attraction (Main)
Flipped her on the mattress (Flipped her on the)
Four by four, the action (Four by four)
Ripped her out of Saks 5th (Ripped her out)
Ooh, we traction (Ooh, we)
You ain't gotta ask it (You ain't gotta)
Got two girls multitasking (Got two), might pull up to Titanic (Titanic, yeah)
[Verse 1]
I don't know what you worship (I don't, I don't), but I think your satanic (I don't, yeah)
When I took you to my house (When I), I got up in your panties (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah, I had to break your heart, you went and told your family (I went, I went)
Remember when I wrecked your car, your father couldn't stand me (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
He can't stand me
Pulling up, coated candy (Pulling up)
Dirty dance with me (Yeah), got my bitch lookin' fancy (CardoGotWings)
Get the racks in, get the dope in the pantry
And relaxing, all that LA shit get nasty
Don't you do it to yourself when I'm not around (Don't you do it)
I know you love to do them drugs, you need to slow it down
I got blessed in that mob and yeah you know it now (Yeah)
You better not let me run into you, yeah it's going down, it's going down

[Chorus]
It's a main attraction (Main)
Flipped her on the mattress (Flipped her on the)
Four by four, the action (Four by four)
Ripped her out of Saks 5th (Ripped her out)
Ooh, we traction (Ooh, we)
You ain't gotta ask it (You ain't gotta)
Got two girls multitasking (Got two), might pull up to Titanic (Titanic, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Save all your stories for your IG (IG)
Yeah, I'm sippin' on this lean, it's in my IV (IV)
If I'm talkin' hella drunk then don't mind me (Mind me)
I might end up at your house and I'm reclinin’ (Reclinin’)
I scored a big bag and we spent that up
You so in love, I thought you had enough
I popped a addy, I think it's addin' up (CardoGotWings)
I'm H-Town, I'm too trill
I call her [?] for the deal
And you know I'm still poppin' them seals (Yeah)
And I love to pop them pills (Yeah, yeah)
Got a Xan right now in my car
Gettin' head like a superstar
You know these diamonds real
You know I tipped that drill
I pull up 'round your crib
I'm whippin' foreign wheel, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]

Got two girls multitasking (Got two), might pull up to Titanic (Titanic, yeah)1Embed
