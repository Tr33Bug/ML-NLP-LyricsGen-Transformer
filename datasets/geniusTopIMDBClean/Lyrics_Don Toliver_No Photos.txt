Huh, huh (Haha), huh, huh (Woo)

[Chorus]
Two hoes (Wet, wet)
I sent your girl back home in new clothes (Yeah, yeah)
Dodgin' paparazzi, keep that head on the low, low (Yeah, yeah)
When I’m in the trap, I can't do no photos
I can't do no photos, I can’t

Me and you, high mileage, don't tell 'em about it
The price is right, then I might buy it
Somewhere on the jet, I'm flyin'
Fuck 'em all, shawty cryin' (Woah-woah)
Officer, I got a stick in my boot
If you play around dumb, then a nigga might shoot (Boom, boom, boom)

[Verse 1]
I can't be greedy, I know they need me
Cookin’ up fettuccine
I got her in town eatin’ tortellini
She a bad, bad, bad, hella bad, bad
Oh, you're gonna pay a big bag, come see me (Gotta pay, gotta pay, gotta pay, gotta pay)
3400, I was clipping up two-piece
Comin’ up, my idol was Gucci
You're kinda bad, oh yeah (Hey)
You better go hide yourself (Oh-oh)
You're finna get high, oh yeah (High)
She do or die, oh yeah (Ooh)
Get in the ride, oh yeah
Get in the ride, oh yeah
Time to get high, oh yeah
Time to get high, oh yeah

Switched out her clothes then I told her, "Bye, bye, bye"

[Verse 2]
Eat it up clean like a cheesecake
She ain't fuckin' with him, he a cheapskate (Uh-huh)
Have your ho signin' up for the sweepstakes
I done ran through the lane with the heatwave
Got two in the cut, need to behave
Ha, yes, uh, I run up my check
I need that head on the freeway
Ah, yes, damn, I'm doin' my best (Doin' my best)
