[Chorus]
I run up a sack, yeah (damn)
I put my hands in the trap
Niggas talk a lot of shit but I know it's cap
I keep my eyes on my money, and my bitch
Hit my line up, what's up with that?
She wanna fuck around with a boss nigga
With them hundreds, what's up with that?
Yeah, yeah, what's up with that?
I run up a sack, yeah
I put my hands in the trap
Niggas talk a lot of shit but I know it's cap
I keep my eyes on my money and my bitch
And my lighter, what's up with that?
She wanna fuck around with a boss nigga
With them hundreds, what's up with that?
Yeah, yeah, what's up with that?
[Verse 1]
Niggas pull up with the honey buns (yeah)
Niggas pull up with a hundred guns (doo doo doo)
I got a chopper on 101 (yeah)
Tryna juug me a metric ton
Eatin' crab down at Benihan' (yeah)
Fuck around and you gon'  see the mob
Tell my niggas so wacky, they do the job (uh)

I been pimpin' on a bed of brawn
Young nigga, I be drippin' hard (hahaha)
I need my back end, yeah, that  back end
Yeah, I'm talkin' a hundred large (large)
I'ma stunt hard with the whole gang
We might pull up, a hundred cars (skrt)
I'ma do my thang, I'ma maintain

I can get you in with one call
Shopping sprees when I'm in the mall (yeah)
Got a bad bitch, she gon' buy it all (yeah)
I'ma spend a check, get the neck
Then I'm dippin' out just like a fuckin' dog
Niggas talk down on the Don
But me, I ain't goin', I'm stuck with y'all
I need a bag, I'ma get it all (damn)
