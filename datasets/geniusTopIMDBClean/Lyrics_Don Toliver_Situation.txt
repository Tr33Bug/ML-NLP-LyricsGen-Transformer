Situation Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm made for the situation, I'ma hit that boy with the spaces
And dawg, we cannot ride with you dependin' on your playlist
I'm only hitting her if she bad, it gotta be an A-list
I'm tryna stop, but I can't relax, I'm warming up to face it
Two-step in that party
Backstage, Jeff Hardy
Put her in that chokehold, WorldStar
Sound like a new car when I bought it
I always dreamed 'bout this lifestyle and happiness
Now that I got mine, I sit back and reminisce
[Verse]
Please don't judge me, I pop pills like M&M's
But I stack my M&M's, smoke weed with my kin and them
No joke, Rakim and them, and I like my denim ripped
And I just arrived and dined in L.A., R.I.P. to Nip
So I had to pour a four, R.I.P. to Pimp
I know y'all want my chips, but I still got all my dip
Remember that .38, it was still here on my hip
Only God know how I live
Only God know how I live, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm made for the situation, I'ma hit that boy with the spaces
And dawg, we cannot ride with you dependin' on your playlist
I'm only hitting her if she bad, it gotta be an A-list
I'm tryna stop, but I can't relax, I'm warming up to face it
Two-step in that party
Backstage, Jeff Hardy
Put her in that chokehold, WorldStar
Sound like a new car when I bought it
I always dreamed 'bout this lifestyle and happiness
Now that I got mine, I sit back and reminisce

[Outro]
I'm made for the situation, I'ma hit that boy with the spaces
And dawg, we cannot ride with you dependin' on your playlist
I'm only hitting her if she bad, it gotta be an A-list
I'm tryna stop, but I can't relax, I'm warming up to face it
Two-step in that party

Put her in that chokehold, WorldStar
Sound like a new car when I bought it
I always dreamed 'bout this lifestyle and happiness
Now that I got mine, I sit back and reminisceYou might also like7Embed
