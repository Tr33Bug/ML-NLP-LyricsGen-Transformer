Im made for the situation Ima hit that boy with the spaces
And dawg we cannot ride with you dependin on your playlist
Im only hitting her if she bad it gotta be an Alist
Im tryna stop but I cant relax Im warming up to face it
Twostep in that party
Backstage Jeff Hardy
Put her in that chokehold WorldStar
Sound like a new car when I bought it
I always dreamed bout this lifestyle and happiness
Now that I got mine I sit back and reminisce
Please dont judge me I pop pills like MMs
But I stack my MMs smoke weed with my kin and them
No joke Rakim and them and I like my denim ripped
And I just arrived and dined in LA RIP to Nip
So I had to pour a four RIP to Pimp
I know yall want my chips but I still got all my dip
Remember that 38 it was still here on my hip
Only God know how I live
Only God know how I live yeah
Im made for the situation Ima hit that boy with the spaces
And dawg we cannot ride with you dependin on your playlist
Im only hitting her if she bad it gotta be an Alist
Im tryna stop but I cant relax Im warming up to face it
Twostep in that party
Backstage Jeff Hardy
Put her in that chokehold WorldStar
Sound like a new car when I bought it
I always dreamed bout this lifestyle and happiness
Now that I got mine I sit back and reminisce
Im made for the situation Ima hit that boy with the spaces
And dawg we cannot ride with you dependin on your playlist
