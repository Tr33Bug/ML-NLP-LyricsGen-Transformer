Slippy Slide Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Hopped up off that jet, yeah she gave me headrest
Jumped right in that V, it came handy with a Tec
Let my dawgs free, let my dawgies out the vet
Know they sellin' free, yeah, they call it, "Be correct"

[Chorus]
I just wanna slippy on your slide (Slippy on your slide)
Slippy on your slide, slip (Slide)
Slippy on your slide, slip (Slippy)
Slippy on your slide, slip
[Verse 1]
Take me to the strip, I'ma pick out my dancer (Pick out my dancer)
She keep a nigga up, like a fist of a panther (Keepin' me up)
Don't short me on no ciggy, I don't deal with the cancer (Hell nah)
I'm dancin' like I'm Shiggy, I just poured up my Fanta (Poured it up)
Oh, I'm smokin' hella cookie, had me lit, Green Lantern
(Smokin' hella)
Linked up with shortie, flew her out from Atlanta (Yeah)
She hopped up out the jetty and her ass was fat
(Hopped it, hopped it)
I caught that heady as a matter of fact (Slurp, nigga)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopped up off that jet, yeah she gave me headrest
Jumped right in that V, it came handy with a Tec
Let my dawgs free, let my dawgies out the vet
Know they sellin' free, yeah, they call it, "Be correct"

[Chorus]
I just wanna slippy on your slide (Slippy on your slide)
Slippy on your slide, slip (Slide)
Slippy on your slide, slip (Slippy)
Slippy on your slide, slip

[Verse 2]
I keep me a .40 and that shit supersized (Yeah, yeah)
He play 'round with dyin', that shit be 25 to life (Oh, my)
Rollin' down that boulevard, I keep it on drive (Yeah, yeah)
One hand on that wheel, the other hand on them thighs
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm the one to beat your back, then grab the keys to that ride
(I'm the one to beat your)
We slide in that ignition, you like that pussy, it slide (It slide)
I was the one to pull up fast, sellin' packs at VLive (Skrrt)
Now, I'm back to run that track, I'm throwin' racks at G5, yeah, yeah
