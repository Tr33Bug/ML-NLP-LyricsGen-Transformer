Every day I wake up new whips hit the pavement
I had to watch my living I dont know no limits at all all all


I get a lil impatient  Yeah yeah 
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship
Sellin all Alicia Keys she on my playlist  Yeah yeah

I I I spilled lean all in my ride  Lean all in my ride 
Dumpin ashes on your thigh  Ashes on your thigh 
You might be ready for surprise oh
