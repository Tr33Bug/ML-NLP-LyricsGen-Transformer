Dumpin ashes on your thigh  Ashes on your thigh

Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship
Sellin all Alicia Keys she on my playlist  Yeah yeah

Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship
Sellin all Alicia Keys she on my playlist

All my cars from Europe his car from Avis
Every day I wake up new whips hit the pavement
I had to watch my living I dont know no limits at all all all
I get a lil impatient  Yeah yeah 
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship
Sellin all Alicia Keys she on my playlist  Yeah yeah 
I am not receiving you know I dont take shit
I I I spilled lean all in my ride  Lean all in my ride 
Dumpin ashes on your thigh  Ashes on your thigh 
You might be ready for surprise oh
