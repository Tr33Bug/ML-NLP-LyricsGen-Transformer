Time  It Smells Like Reefah Out Here  Lyrics
Excuse me is that reefer I smell
No sir
Uh uh dont lie to an old man boy it aint right You selfish bastards Yall gon stand out here and smoke a joint and aint gon ask old man if he want a hit
You want a hit old man
Do a crack whores pussy stank Hahaha Im a drug addict son I always want a hit
She love me she on my line
I dont want her for the whole damn time
I just want her for the one damn night
Saint Laurent mask with the old school Nike
I see you over there lil shawty you fine
Take her to the crib fuck a wine with the dine
But yeah Im comin back Im runnin up a check baby
You see me comin through Im pullin in a Vette baby
I know you want to have love have sex baby
I know I know you wanna ride with the real baby
But I gotta tell a lie safehouse my spy
Twotone thats a drug Im pouring an eight it straight drop
Got my wrist on Chris Rock diamonds make you do the criss cross
Im in my trap with a banger Im smokin a wood a fanger  Yeahyeah 
Bitch Im a dog

If I if I dont answer my phone then dont call  II II 
I dont want you in my life you not involved yeah
She love me she on my line
I dont want her for the whole damn time
I just want her for the one damn night
Saint Laurent mask with the old school Nike
I see you over there lil shawty you fine
Take her to the crib fuck a wine with the dine
She love me she on my line
I dont want her for the whole damn time
I just want her for the one damn night
Saint Laurent mask with the old school Nike
I see you over there lil shawty you fine
Take her to the crib fuck a wine with the dine
