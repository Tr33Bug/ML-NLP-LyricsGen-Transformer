TranslationsPortuguÃªsItalianoWhat You Need Lyrics[Intro]
What you need, lil' baby?
What you need, lil' baby?

[Chorus]
Tell me what you really, really need, lil' baby (Tell me what you)
Take you out and put you in double C, lil' babe
Have you out of town and in them cheeks, lil' baby (Oh, yeah)
Got you down and out and on your knees, lil' babe (Woah, woah)
I like two when I'm in the cut
If I take you to my crib, I put that way down in your gut
Donny's tired of talkin', oh, you saddy? "So what?"
Donny's tired of talkin', got them Xannies goin' up
[Bridge]
Shawty at the strip 'til the lease up
Tell me what you need, love, tell me what you need, love
Cash on the table if you need some
Tell me what you need, tell me what you need, love
Tell me what you need, tell me just what you like
Gucci, ah-ah
Whatever you need, whatever you need
Whatever you need

[Chorus]
Tell me what you really, really need, lil' baby (Tell me what you)
Take you out and put you in double C, lil' babe
Have you out of town and in them cheeks, lil' baby (Oh, yeah)
Got you down and out and on your knees, lil' babe (Woah, woah)
I like two when I'm in the cut
If I take you to my crib, I put that way down in your gut
Donny's tired of talkin', oh, you saddy? "So what?"
Donny's tired of talkin', got them Xannies goin' up

[Verse]
What's the price? Or what's the digits?
See you stackin' all your money, all your chicken
Thought you was right, and I was willin' (I was willin')
Don't you hop up in your car and get in your feelings (Ooh, woo)
I just wanted to be heard, but I made some millions
I done caught you late night in that club countin' your Benjamins
I know you steady touchin' on your body when you reminisce (You reminisce)
Whatever you want, count them dividends, yeah

Tell me what you really, really need, lil' baby (Tell me what you)
Take you out and put you in double C, lil' babe
Have you out of town and in them cheeks, lil' baby (Oh, yeah)
Got you down and out and on your knees, lil' babe (Woah, woah)
I like two when I'm in the cut
If I take you to my crib, I put that way down in your gut
Donny's tired of talkin', oh, you saddy? "So what?"
Donny's tired of talkin', got them Xannies goin' up

[Outro]
Donny's tired of talkin', got them Xannies
