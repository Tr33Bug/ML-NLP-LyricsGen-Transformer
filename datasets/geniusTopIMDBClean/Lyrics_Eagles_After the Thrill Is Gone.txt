Same dances in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just cant lose
Theres no telling what a man might use
After the thrill is gone
The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
Youre not quite lovers and youre not quite friends
After the thrill is gone oh
After the thrill is gone
What can you do when your dreams come true
And its not quite like you planned
What have you done to be losing the one
You held it so tight in your hand well
Time passes and you must move on
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
Youre afraid you might fall out of fashion
And youre feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
That aint no kind of loving at all well
Same dances in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You dont care about winning but you dont want to lose
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone
After the thrill is gone oh
After the thrill is gone
