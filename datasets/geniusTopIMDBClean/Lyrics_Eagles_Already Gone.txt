Well I heard some people talkin just the other day
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
But let me tell you I got some news for you
And youll soon find out its true
And then youll have to eat your lunch all by yourself
Cause Im already gone
And Im feelin strong
I will sing this victry song
Woo hoo hoo my my
Woo hoo hoo
The letter that you wrote me
Made me stop and wonder why
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
Just remember this my girl when you look up in the sky
You can see the stars and still not see the light
Thats right 
And Im already gone
And Im feelin strong
I will sing this victry song
Woo hoo hoo my my
Woo hoo hoo
Well I know it wasnt you who held me down
Heaven knows it wasnt you who set me free
So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains
And we never even know we have the key


But me Im already gone
And Im feelin strong
I will sing  I will sing  this victry song
Cause Im already gone
Yes Im already gone
And Im feelin strong
I will sing this victry song
Cause Im already gone
Yes Im already gone
Already gone
All right nightynight
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone
