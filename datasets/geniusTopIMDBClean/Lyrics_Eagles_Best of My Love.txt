Every night Im lying in bed
Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces
And loud empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Ohohohoh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
You get the best of my love 
Ohohohoh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
You get the best of my love 
Im going back in time
And its a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping
But every morning
I wake up and worry
Whats gonna happen today
You see it your way
And I see it mine
But we both see it slippin away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasnt enough
Ohuhoh but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love
Ohohohoh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
The best of my love 
Ohohohoh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
The best of my love 
Ohohohoh sweet darling
Evry night and day
You get the best of my love 
The best of my love 
Ohohohoh sweet darling
Ohohuh ohohuh
You get the best of my love 
The best of my love 
Ohohohoh sweet darling
You get the best of my love
The best of my love 
Ohohohoh sweet darling
Mhmhmhmh
You get the best of my love
You get the best of my love 
The best of my love
