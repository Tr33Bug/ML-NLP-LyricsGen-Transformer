Desperado
Why dont you come to your senses
Youve been out ridin fences
For so long now
Oh youre a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin you
Can hurt you somehow
Dont you draw the queen of diamonds boy
Shell beat you if shes able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you cant get
Desperado
Oh you aint getting no younger
Your pain and your hunger
Theyre driving you home
And freedom oh freedom
Well thats just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone
Dont your feet get cold in the wintertime
The sky wont snow and the sun wont shine
Its hard to tell the nighttime from the day
Youre losing all your highs and lows
Aint it funny how the feeling goes
Away
Desperado
Why dont you come to your senses
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be rainin
But theres a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
Let somebody love you 
You better let somebody love you
Before its too late
