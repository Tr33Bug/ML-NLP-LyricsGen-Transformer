I make my living off the evening news
Just give me something something I can use
People love it when you lose they love dirty laundry
Well I couldve been an actor but I wound up here
I just have to look good I dont have to be clear
Come and whisper in my ear give us dirty laundry
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up kick em all around
We got the bubbleheaded bleachblonde who comes on at five
She can tell you about the plane crash with a gleam in her eye
Its interesting when people die give us dirty laundry
Can we film the operation Is the head dead yet
You know the boys in the newsroom got a running bet
Get the widow on the set we need dirty laundry
You dont really need to find out whats going on
You dont really want to know just how far its gone
Just leave well enough alone keep your dirty laundry
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down
Kick em when theyre stiff kick em all around
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down 
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down 
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down 
Kick em when theyre stiff kick em all around 
Dirty little secrets dirty little lies
We got our dirty little fingers in everybodys pie
Love to cut you down to size we love dirty laundry
We can do the innuendo we can dance and sing
When its said and done we havent told you a thing
We all know that crap is king give us dirty laundry
Kick em when theyre up kick em when theyre down
