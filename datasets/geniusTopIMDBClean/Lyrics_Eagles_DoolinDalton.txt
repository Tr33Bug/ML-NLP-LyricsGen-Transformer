They were dueling DoolinDalton
High or low it was the same
Easy money and faithless women
Redeye whiskey for the pain
Go down Bill Dalton it must be Gods will
Two brothers lying dead in Coffeyville
Two voices call to you from where they stood
Lay down your law books now
Theyre no damn good
Better keep on moving DoolinDalton
Till your shadow sets you free
If youre fast and if youre lucky
You will never see that hanging tree
Well the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waiting for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy Lord cause nothing ever changed
Until Bill Doolin met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap just biding time
Then he laughed and said Im going
And so he left that peaceful life behind
Mmh
