DoolinDaltonDesperado  reprise  Lyrics
Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
All you bloodthirsty bystanders will you try to
Find your seats
Watch em duelin  duelin 
DoolinDalton  Dalton 
High or low  high low  its all the same
Easy money and faithless women
You will never kill the pain
Go down Bill Doolin dont you wonder why
Sooner or later we all have to die
Sooner or later thats a stonecold fact
Four men ride out and only three ride back
The queen of diamonds let you down
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out
And its finlly turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado
Is there gonna be anything left is there gonna be anything 
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
Aint it hard when youre all alone in the center ring 
Now theres no time left to borrow
Is there gonna be anything left 
Only stardust
Maybe tomorrow 
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
