Get Over It Lyrics
I turn on the tube and what do I see?
A whole lot of people crying, "Don't blame me"
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feeling sorry for themselves
Victim of this, victim of that
Your mamma's too thin and your daddy's too fat

Get over it
Get over it
All this whining and crying and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it
You say you haven't been the same since you had your little crash
But you might feel better if I gave you some cash
The more I think about it, Old Billy was right
Let's kill all the lawyers, kill 'em tonight
You don't want to work, you want to live like a king
But the big, bad world doesn't owe you a thing

Get over it
Get over it
If you donâ€™t wanna play then you might as well quit
Get over it, get over it

It's like going to confession every time I hear you speak
You're making the most of your losing streak
Some call it sick, but I call it weak
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, you drag it around like a ball and chain
You wallow in the guilt, you wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag, you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter, bringing everybody down
You bitch about the present and blame it on the past
I'd like to find your inner child and kick its little ass
You might also like
Get over it
Get over it
All this bitching and moaning and pitching a fit
Get over it, get over it

Get over it
Get over it
It's gotta stop sometime, so why don't you quit?
Get over it, get over itEmbed
