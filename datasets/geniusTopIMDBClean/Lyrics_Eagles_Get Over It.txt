I turn on the tube and what do I see
A whole lot of people crying Dont blame me
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feeling sorry for themselves
Victim of this victim of that
Your mammas too thin and your daddys too fat
Get over it
Get over it
All this whining and crying and pitching a fit
Get over it get over it
You say you havent been the same since you had your little crash
But you might feel better if I gave you some cash
The more I think about it Old Billy was right
Lets kill all the lawyers kill em tonight
You dont want to work you want to live like a king
But the big bad world doesnt owe you a thing
Get over it
Get over it
If you dont wanna play then you might as well quit
Get over it get over it
Its like going to confession every time I hear you speak
Youre making the most of your losing streak
Some call it sick but I call it weak
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah you drag it around like a ball and chain
You wallow in the guilt you wallow in the pain
You wave it like a flag you wear it like a crown
Got your mind in the gutter bringing everybody down
You bitch about the present and blame it on the past
Id like to find your inner child and kick its little ass
Get over it
Get over it
All this bitching and moaning and pitching a fit
Get over it get over it
Get over it
Get over it
Its gotta stop sometime so why dont you quit
Get over it get over it
