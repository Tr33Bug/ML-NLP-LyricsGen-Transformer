Springtime and the acacias are blooming
Southern California will see one more day
Dreamland and busness is booming
The birds are a singing as I drift away
She looks another year older
From too many lovers who used her and ran
But some nights oh she looks like an angel
And shes always willing to hold you again
So give her this dance
She cant be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than shes taken
And Ill go down doing the Hollywood Waltz
Springtime and the lady is grieving
The lovers just stand there with nothing to say
They got what they wanted
Theyre packing and leaving
To look for another to love the same way
So give her this dance
She cant be forsaken
Learn how to love her
With all of her faults
She gave more than shes taken
And Ill go down doing the Hollywood Waltz
The Hollywood Waltz
