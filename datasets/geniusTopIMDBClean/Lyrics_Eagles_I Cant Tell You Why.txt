Look at us baby up all night
Tearing our love apart
Arent we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark Ahhah
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I cant tell you why
When we get crazy it just aint right
Try to keep your head little girl 
Girl I get lonely too
You dont have to worry just hold on tight
Dont get caught in your little world 
Cause I love you
Nothings wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I cant tell you why
No baby I cant tell you why
I cant tell you why
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I cant tell you why
No no baby I cant tell you why
I cant tell you why
I cant tell you why
