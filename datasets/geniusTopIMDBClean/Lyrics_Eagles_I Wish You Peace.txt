I wish you peace when the cold winds blow
Warmed by the fires glow
I wish you comfort in the the lonely time
And arms to hold you when you ache inside
I wish you hope when things are going bad
Kind words when times are sad
I wish you shelter from the the raging wind
Cooling waters at the fevers end
I wish you peace when times are hard
The light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your your dreams are low
I wish you the strength to let love grow on
I wish you the strength to let love flow
I wish you peace when times are hard
The light to guide you through the dark
And when storms are high and your your dreams are low
I wish you the strength to let love grow on
I wish you the strength to let love flow
