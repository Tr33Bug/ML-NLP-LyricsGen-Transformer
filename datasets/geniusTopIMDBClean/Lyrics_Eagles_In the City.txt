Somewhere out there on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be something better
But theres nowhere else in sight
Its survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets dont have much pity
When youre down thats where youll stay
In the city  oh oh 
In the city  oh ohhh 
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows and life aint very pretty
No ones there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be something better
And I cant stay another night
In the city  oh oh 
In the city  oh ohhh 
In the city
In the city
In the city  oh ohhh
