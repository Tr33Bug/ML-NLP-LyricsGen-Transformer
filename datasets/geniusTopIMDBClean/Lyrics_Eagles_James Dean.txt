James Dean James Dean
I know just what you mean
James Dean you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look alright
If I could see it on the silver screen
You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Well talk about a lowdown bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop soda pop basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin all the rules
James Dean James Dean
So hungry and so lean
James Dean you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
Little James Dean up on the screen
Wondering who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
And took him down the road to eternity
James Dean James Dean you bought it sight unseen
James Dean James Dean you bought it sight unseen
You were too fast to live too young to die byebye
You were too fast to live too young to die byebye
Byebye byebye byebye bye bye
