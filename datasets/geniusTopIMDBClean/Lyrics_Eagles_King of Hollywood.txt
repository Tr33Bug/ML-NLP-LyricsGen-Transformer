Well he sits up there on his leatherette
Looks through pictures of the ones that he hasnt had yet
When he thinks he wants a closer look
He gets out his little black telephone book
Hes calling calling calling
Hes calling calling calling
Hes calling calling calling
Hes calling
Come sit down here beside me honey
Lets have a little heart to heart
Now look at me and tell me darling
How badly do you want this part
Are you willing to sacrifice
And are you willing to be real nice
All your talent and my good taste
Id hate to see it go to waste
We gon get you an apartment honey
We gon get you a car
Yeah were going to take care of you darling 
We gon make you a movie star
For years Ive seen em come and go
He says Ive had em all ya know
I handled everything in my own way
I made em what they are today
Guitar Solo 1
After while nothing was pretty
After while everything got lost
Still his Jacuzzi runneth over
Still he just couldnt get off
Hes just another power junky
Just another silk scarf monkey
Youd know it if you saw his stuff
The man just isnt big enough
