Its just another day in paradise
As you stumble to your bed
Youd give anything to silence
Those voices ringing in your head
You thought you could find happiness
Just over that green hill
You thought you would be satisfied
But you never will
Learn to be still
We are like sheep without a shepherd
We dont know how to be alone
So we wander around this desert
And wind up following the wrong gods home
But the flock cries out for another
And they keep answering that bell
And one more starryeyed messiah
Meets a violent farewell
Learn to be still
Now the flowers in your garden
They dont smell so sweet
Maybe youve forgotten
The heaven lying at your feet
There are so many contradictions
In all these messages we send
We keep asking 
How do I get out of here
Where do I fit in
Though the world is torn and shaken
Even if your heart is breaking
Its waiting for you to awaken
And someday you will

Learn to be still
You just keep on running
Keep on running
