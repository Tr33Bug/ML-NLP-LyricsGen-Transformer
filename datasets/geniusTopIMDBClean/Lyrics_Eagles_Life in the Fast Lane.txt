TranslationsEspaol
He was a hardheaded man he was brutally handsome
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up and he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless they said he was crude
They had one thing in common they were good in bed
Shed say Faster faster the lights are turnin red
Life in the fast lane surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane huh
Are you with me so far
Eager for action hot for the game
The coming attraction the drop of a name
They knew all the right people they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror lines on her face
She pretended not to notice she was caught up in the race
Out every evening until it was light
He was too tired to make it she was too tired to fight about it
Life in the fast lane surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane huh
Life in the fast lane everything all the time
Life in the fast lane uhhuh
Blowin and burnin blinded by thirst
They didnt see the stop sign took a turn for the worst
She said Listen baby you can hear the engine ring
Weve been up and down this highway havent seen a goddamn thing
He said Call the doctor I think Im gonna crash
The doctor say hes comin but you gotta pay in cash
They went rushin down that freeway messed around and got lost
They didnt care they were just dyin to get off and it was
Life in the fast lane surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane uhhuh
Life in the fast lane everything all the time
Life in the fast lane uhhuh
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane
