Long Road Out of Eden Lyrics
Moon shining down through the palms
Shadows moving on the sand
Somebody whispering the twenty-third psalm
Dusty rifle in his trembling hands
Somebody trying just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep

Silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky
Cold silver satellites, ghostly caravans passing by
Galaxies unfolding, new worlds being born
Pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn
And it's a long road out of Eden

Music blasting from an SUV
On a bright and sunny day
Rolling down the interstate
In the good old USA
Having lunch at the petroleum club
Smoking fine cigars and swapping lives
He said, "Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket!"
"Give me another piece of that pecan pie!"

Freeways flickering, cell phones chiming a tune
We're riding to utopia, road map says we'll be arriving soon
Captains of the old order clinging to the reins
Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains

But it's a long road out of Eden

Back home I was so certain
The path was very clear
But now I have to wonder
What are we doing here?
I'm not counting on tomorrow
And I can't tell wrong from right
But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight
You might also like

Weaving down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda
And now we're driving dazed and drunk
Been down the road to Damascus
The road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way
He said, "It's hard to stop this binging, once you get a taste"
"But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste"

Behold the bitten apple, the power of the tools
But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools

And it's a long road out of Eden2Embed
