Moon shining down through the palms
Shadows moving on the sand
Somebody whispering the twentythird psalm
Dusty rifle in his trembling hands
Somebody trying just to stay alive
He got promises to keep
Over the ocean in America
Far away and fast asleep
Silent stars blinking in the blackness of an endless sky
Cold silver satellites ghostly caravans passing by
Galaxies unfolding new worlds being born
Pilgrims and prodigals creeping toward the dawn
And its a long road out of Eden
Music blasting from an SUV
On a bright and sunny day
Rolling down the interstate
In the good old USA
Having lunch at the petroleum club
Smoking fine cigars and swapping lives
He said Give me another slice of that barbecued brisket
Give me another piece of that pecan pie
Freeways flickering cell phones chiming a tune
Were riding to utopia road map says well be arriving soon
Captains of the old order clinging to the reins
Assuring us these aches inside are only growing pains
But its a long road out of Eden
Back home I was so certain
The path was very clear
But now I have to wonder
What are we doing here
Im not counting on tomorrow
And I cant tell wrong from right
But Id give anything to be there in your arms tonight


Weaving down the American highway
Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk
Bloated with entitlement loaded on propaganda
And now were driving dazed and drunk
Been down the road to Damascus
The road to Mandalay
Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way
He said Its hard to stop this binging once you get a taste
But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste
Behold the bitten apple the power of the tools
But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools
And its a long road out of Eden
