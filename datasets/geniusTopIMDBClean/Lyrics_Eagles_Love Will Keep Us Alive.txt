I was standing
All alone against the world outside
You were searching
For a place to hide
Lost and lonely
Now youve given me the will to survive
When were hungry love will keep us alive
Dont you worry
Sometimes youve just got to let it ride
The world is changing
Right before your eyes
Now Ive found you
Theres no more emptiness inside
When were hungry love will keep us alive
I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby theres nothing I wouldnt do
Now Ive found you
Theres no more emptiness inside
When were hungry love will keep us alive
I would die for you
Climb the highest mountain
Baby theres nothing I wouldnt do
I was standing
All alone against the world outside
You were searching
For a place to hide
Lost and lonely
Now youve given me the will to survive
When were hungry love will keep us alive
When were hungry love will keep us alive
When were hungry love will keep us alive
