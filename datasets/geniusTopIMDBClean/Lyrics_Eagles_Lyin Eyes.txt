City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man and she wont have to worry
Shell dress up all in lace and go in style
Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend whos feelin down
But he knows where shes goin as shes leavin
She is headed for the cheatin side of town
You cant hide your lyin eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now youd realize
There aint no way to hide your lyin eyes
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
Because he makes her feel the way she used to feel
She rushes to his arms they fall together
She whispers that its only for a while
She swears that soon shell be comin back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile
You cant hide your lyin eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now youd realize
There aint no way to hide your lyin eyes
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night its gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
Shes so far gone she feels just like a fool
My oh my you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well so carefully
Aint it funny how your new life didnt change things
Youre still the same old girl you used to be
You cant hide your lyin eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now youd realize
There aint no way to hide your lyin eyes
There aint no way to hide your lyin eyes
Honey you cant hide your lyin eyes
