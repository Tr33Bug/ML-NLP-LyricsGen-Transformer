Tell me  how do you feel
Like youre rolling so fast that youre spinning your wheels
Dont feel too bad youre not all along
Were all trying to get along
With everybody else trying to go their way
Youre bound to get tripped and what can you say
Just go along until they turn out the lights
Theres nothing we can do to fight it
No mans got it made till hes far beyond the pain
And we who must remain go on living just the same
I once knew a man very talented guy
Hes sing for the people and people would cry
They knew that his song came from deep down inside
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes
And so he traveled along touch your heart then be gone
Like a flower he bloomed till that old hickory wind
Called him home
We who must remain go on laughing just the same
