Well my time went too quickly
I went licketysplitly out to my old fiftyfive
As I pulled away slowly feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive
And now the suns coming up
Im riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade and I lead the parade
Just a wishing Id stayed a little longer
Lord dont you know the feelings getting stronger
Six in the morning gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
Im headed home from your place
And now the suns coming up yes it is
Im riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Riding with lady luck
