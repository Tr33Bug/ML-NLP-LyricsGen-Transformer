Cruising down the center of a two way street
Wondering who is really in the drivers seat
Minding my business along comes big brother
Says son you better get on one side or the other
Im out on the border im walking the line
Dont you tell me about your law and order
Im trying to change this water to wine
After a hard day im safe at home
Fooling with my baby on the telephone
Out of nowhere somebody cuts in and
Says hmm you in some trouble boy we know where youre been
Im out on the border I thought this was a private line
Dont you tell me about your law and order
Im trying to change this water to wine
Never mind your name just give us your number mm
Never mind your face just show us your card mm
And we wanna know whose wing are you under
You better step to the right or we can make it hard
Im stuck on the border
All I wanted was some peace of mind
Dont you tell me bout your law and order
Im trying to change this water to wine
On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border
Leave me be  im just walking this line
On the border
On the border
All i wanted was some peace of mind peace of mind
Im out on the border
On the border
Cant you see im trying to change this water to wine
On the border
Dont you tell me bout your law and order
Sick and tired of all your law and order
On the border
Sick and tired of it
On the border
Im the man on the border
On the border
