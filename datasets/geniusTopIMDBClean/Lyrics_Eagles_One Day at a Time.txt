Well you know I was always the first to arrive at the party
Oh and the last to leave the scene of the crime
Well it started with a couple of beers
And it went I dont know how many years
Like a run away train heading for the
End of the line
Well I finally got around to admit that I might have a problem
But I thought it was just too damn big of a mountain to climb
Well I got down on my knees and said Hey
I just cant go on living this way
Guess I have to learn to live my life
One day at a time
Oh yeah one day at a time
Oh yeah one day at a time
Oh yeah one day at a time
Oh yeah one day at a time
Well I finally got around to admit that I was the problem
When I use to put the blame on everybodys shoulders but mine
All the friends I use to run with are gone
But I hadnt planned on living this long
Have to learn to live my life
One day at a time
It was something I was too blind to see
I got help from something greater then me
And I have to learn to live my life
One day at a time
