One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
Were gonna find out pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling the fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons and you got desires
Well I got a few of my own
Ooh someone to be kind to
In between the dark and the light
Ooh coming right behind you
Swear Im gonna find you one of these nights
One of these dreams
One of these lost and lonely dreams now
Were gonna find one
Mmm one that really screams
Ive been searching for the daughter of the devil himself
Ive been searching for an angel in white
Ive been waiting for a woman whos a little of both
And I can feel her but shes nowhere in sight
Ooh loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right  oh oh oh 
Ooh coming right behind you
Swear Im gonna find you one of these nights


One of these nights 
Mmm in between the dark and the light
Comin right behind you
Swear Im gonna find you
Get you baby one of these nights
One of these nights 
Hoo hoohoo
Hoo hoohoo
One of these nights 
I can feel you
I can feel
One of these nights 
Comin right behind you
Swear Im gonna find you now
One of these nights 
And it gets so dark
So dark and cold and lonely
One of these nights
One of these crazy crazy crazy nights
One of these nights 
Swear Im gonna find you
Comin right behind you now
One of these nights 
Hoo hoohoooo
One of these nights 
And I wanna say ahhh
One of these nights 
Ahh one of these one of these
One of these nights 
Ahh comin right behind you
Swear Im gonna find you
One of these nights 
One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
One of these nights
