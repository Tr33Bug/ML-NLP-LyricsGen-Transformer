Please Come Home for Christmas LyricsBells will be ringing this sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Year's will find you home
There will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again
Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once againYou might also like3Embed
