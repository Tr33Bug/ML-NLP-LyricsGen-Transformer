Bells will be ringing this sad sad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My babys gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing Silent Night
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas by New Years night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
So wont you tell me youll never more roam
Christmas and New Years will find you home
There will be no more sorrow no grief and pain
And Ill be happy happy once again
Ooh therell be no more sorrow no grief and pain
And Ill be happy Christmas once again
