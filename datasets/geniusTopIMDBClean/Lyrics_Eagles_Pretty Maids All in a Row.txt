Hi there how are you Its been a long time
Seems like weve come a long way
My but we learn so slow
And heroes they come and they go
And leave us behind as if were supposed to know
Why
Why
Why do we give up our hearts to the past
And why must we grow up so fast
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend its nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember places to go
Pretty maids all in a row
