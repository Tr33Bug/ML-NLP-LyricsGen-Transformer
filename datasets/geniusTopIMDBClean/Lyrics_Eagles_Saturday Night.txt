Ya
One two three
Two two three
Seems like a dream now it was so long ago
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight
She said Tell me oh tell me was I all right
Whatever happened to Saturday night
The years brought the railroad it ran by my door
Now theres boards on the windows and dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another mans side
And I pass the time with my pride
What a tangled web we weave
Go around with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell
The dancer from the dance
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Choosing a friend and losing a fight
She said Tell me oh tell me are you all right
Whatever happened to Saturday night
Whatever happened to Saturday night
