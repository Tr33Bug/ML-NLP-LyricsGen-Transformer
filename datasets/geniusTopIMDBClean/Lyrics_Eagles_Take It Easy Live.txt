Take It Easy  Live  LyricsWell Im running down the road tryin to loosen my load
Ive got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me two that wanna stone me
One says shes a friend of mine
Take it easy take it easy
Dont let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can dont even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy
Well Im a standing on a corner in Southern California
And such a fine sight to see
Its a girl my lord in a flatbed Ford
Slowin down to take a look at me
Come on baby dont say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
But we will never be here again so open up Im climbin in take it easy
Well Im running down the road trying to loosen
My load got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin for a lover who wont blow my cover
Shes so hard to find
Take it easy take it easy
Dont let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Come on baby dont say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Well you know we got it easy
We outta take it easy yeah
