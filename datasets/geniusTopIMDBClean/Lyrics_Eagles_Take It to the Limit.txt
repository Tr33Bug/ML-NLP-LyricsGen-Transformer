All alone at the end of the evening
When the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know Ive always been a dreamer
Spent my life running round 
And its so hard to change
Cant seem to settle down 
But the dreams Ive seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine
And when youre looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care 
And you cant find the door
Cant find it anywhere 
When theres nothing to believe in
Still youre coming back youre running back
Youre coming back for more
So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit  Weeee 
Take it to the limit  Cmon 
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit  Weeee 
Take it to the limit  You gotta 
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit  Weeee 
Take it to the limit  Come on and 
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit  Ahah 
Take it to the limit  Ahah 
Take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
