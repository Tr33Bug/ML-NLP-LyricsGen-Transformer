Its another tequila sunrise
Starin slowly cross the sky I said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by
Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And shes out runnin round
She wasnt just another woman
And I couldnt keep from comin on
Its been so long
Oh and its a hollow feelin
When it comes down to dealin friends
It never ends
Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
Its another tequila sunrise this old world
Still looks the same
Another frame mmm
