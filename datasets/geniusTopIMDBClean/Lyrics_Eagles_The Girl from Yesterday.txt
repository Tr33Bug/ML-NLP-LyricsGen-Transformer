It wasnt really sad the way they said goodbye
Or maybe it just hurt so bad she couldnt cry
He packed his things walked out the door and drove away
And she became the girl from yesterday
He took a plane across the sea
To some foreign land
She stayed at home and tried so hard to understand
How someone who had been so close could be so far away
And she became the girl from yesterday
She doesnt know whats right
She doesnt know whats wrong
She only knows the pain that comes from waiting for so long
And she doesnt count the teardrops
That shes cried while hes away
Because she knows deep in her heart
That hell be back someday
The lights on in the window shes waiting by the phone
Talking to a memory thats never coming home
She dreams of his returning and the things that he might say
But shell always be the girl from yesterday
