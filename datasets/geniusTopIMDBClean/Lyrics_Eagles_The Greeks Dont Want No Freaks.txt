Hey 
There was beer all over the dance floor
And the band was playing rhythm and blues
You got down and did the gator and half an hour later
You were barfing all over your girlfriends shoes
But the Greeks dont want no freaks
The Greeks dont want no freaks
Just put a little smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks dont want no freaks
Gator 
Yeah woooo woo Aaow 
She was the pride and the passion of Dixie
She did exactly what her daddy had planned
She was perfect little sister until somebody missed her
And they found her in the bushes with the boys in the band
But the Greeks dont want no freaks
No the Greeks dont want no freaks
So put a great big smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks dont want no freaks
No the Greeks dont want no freaks
Said the Greeks dont want no freaks
Just put that monster smile on them rosy cheeks
Cause the Greeks dont want no freaks
No the Greeks dont want no freaks
Ahhaaahh
