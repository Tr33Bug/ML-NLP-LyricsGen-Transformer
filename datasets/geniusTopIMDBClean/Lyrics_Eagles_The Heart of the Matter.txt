I got the call today I didnt wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside loves open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew Im learning again
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
Theres a yearning undefined
People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age
The trust and selfassurance that can lead to happiness
Theyre the very things we kill I guess
Pride and competition cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
Doesnt keep me warm
Im learning to live without you now
But I miss you Baby
The more I know the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out I have to learn again
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
There are people in your life whove come and gone
They let you down and hurt your pride
Better put it all behind you life goes on
You keep carrin that anger itll eat you inside
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think its about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
Ive been tryin to get down to the Heart of the Matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So Im thinkin about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if even if you dont love me anymore
