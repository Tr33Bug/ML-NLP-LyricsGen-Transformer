She came from Providence
One in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came
Across the sea
She heard about a place
People were smiling
They spoke about the red mans ways
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide
Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Cant wait to tell you all
What its like up there
And they called it paradise
I dont know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high
And then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do
Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And Jesus people bought em
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun
Sinking in the sea


You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did
So many years ago
They even brought a neon sign
Jesus is coming
They brought the white mans burden down
Brought the white mans reign
Who will provide the grand design
What is yours and what is mine
Cause there is no more new frontier
But we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs
And justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God
And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
And stand up and sing about
What its like up there
They call it paradise
I dont know why
You call someplace paradise
Kiss it goodbye
