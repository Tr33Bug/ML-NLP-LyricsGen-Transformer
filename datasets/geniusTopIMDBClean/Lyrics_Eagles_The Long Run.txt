I used to hurry a lot I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh that didnt get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldnt carry on that way
Oh I did some damage
I know its true
Didnt know I was so lonely
Till I found you
You can go the distance
Well find out
In the long run  In the long run 
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one  Is a strong one 
People talking about us
They got nothin else to do
When it all comes down
We will still come through
In the long run
Ooh I want to tell you
Its a long run
You know I dont understand
Why you dont treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
Cause all the debutantes in Houston baby
Couldnt hold a candle to you
Did you do it for love
Did you do it for money
Did you do it for spite
Did you think you had to honey
Who is gonna make it
Well find out
In the long run  In the long run 
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one  Is a strong one 
Well were scared
But we aint shakin
Kinda bent
But we aint breakin
In the long run
Ooh I want to tell you
Its a long run
In the long run
In the long run
Gonna find out ooh fafafafind out
Longlonglonglong longlonglonglong
Ooh runrunrun baby runrun baby
Long long long long
