The Sad Café Lyrics
Out in the shiny night, the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Café
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like "love" and "freedom"
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Café
Oh, expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by

Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind, inside the Sad Café
{Acoustic Solo}

The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free

Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why, it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café
Why don't you meet me at midnight, baby, inside the Sad Café
