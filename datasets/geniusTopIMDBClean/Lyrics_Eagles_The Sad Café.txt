The Sad Caf Lyrics
Out in the shiny night the rain was softly falling
Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Caf
Oh it seemed like a holy place protected by amazing grace
And we would sing right out loud the things we could not say
We thought we could change this world with words like love and freedom
We were part of the lonely crowd inside the Sad Caf
Oh expecting to fly
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by
Some of their dreams came true some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind inside the Sad Caf
Acoustic Solo
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore
Now that Glory Train it dont stop here no more
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
I dont know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
No use in asking why it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Caf
Why dont you meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Caf
Saxophone Solo
