Those Shoes Lyrics
Tell us what you're gonna do tonight to mama
There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows you're looking good enough
But you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have something to lose
Oh no, pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes?
Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You go to have your independence
But you don't know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
An' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You can't believe your reviews
Oh no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
{Guitar Solo}

They're looking at you, leaning on you
Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love
They're waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh, they got the kid glove
You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
You might also likeOh, no, you can't do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
