Tell us what youre gonna do tonight to mama
There must be someplace you can go
In the middle of the tall drinks and the drama
There must be someone you know
God knows youre looking good enough
But youre so smooth and the worlds so rough
You might have something to lose
Oh no pretty mama
What you gonna do in those shoes
Got those pretty little straps around your ankles
Got those shiny little chains around your heart
You go to have your independence
But you dont know just where to start
Desperation in the singles bars
An all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars
You cant believe your reviews
Oh no you cant do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
Guitar Solo
Theyre looking at you leaning on you
Tell you anything you wanna hear
They give you tablets of love
Theyre waiting for you
Got to score you
Handy with a shovel and so sincere
Ooh they got the kid glove
You just want someone to talk to
They just wanna get their hands on you
You get whatever you choose
Oh no you cant do that
Once you started wearing those shoes

Oh no you cant do that
Once you started wearing those shoes
Shoes
