Train Leaves Here This Morning Lyrics
I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well
Have been completely blind

So if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on
She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on

But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hanging on
And there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

"1320 North Columbus" was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
It might have been that it was getting time to leave

And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on"
'Cause there's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be on

There's a train, leaves here this morning
And I don't know what I might be onYou might also like2Embed
