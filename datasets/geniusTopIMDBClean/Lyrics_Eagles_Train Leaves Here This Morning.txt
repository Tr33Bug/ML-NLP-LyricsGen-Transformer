I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there but I may as well
Have been completely blind
So if you see me walking all alone
Dont look back Im just on my way back home
And theres a train leaves here this morning
And I dont know what I might be on
She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasnt something more to blame it on
But if time makes a difference while were gone
Tell me now and I wont be hanging on
And theres a train leaves here this morning
And I dont know what I might be on
1320 North Columbus was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I dont know just what she wanted
It might have been that it was getting time to leave
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said Lead on
Cause theres a train leaves here this morning
And I dont know what I might be on
Theres a train leaves here this morning
And I dont know what I might be on
