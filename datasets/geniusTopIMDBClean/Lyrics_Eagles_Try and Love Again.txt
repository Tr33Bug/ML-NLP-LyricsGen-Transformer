TranslationsEspaolWhen youre out there on your own
Where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around
You were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to
One by one the lonely feelings come
Day by day they slowly fade away
Ooh the look was in her eyes
You never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
And the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her
Should I stay or go I really want to know
Would I lose or win if I try and love again
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh gonna try and love again
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh Im gonna try and love again
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh gonna try and love
Right or wrong whats done is done
Its only moments that you borrow
But the thoughts will linger on
Of the lady and her song
When the sun comes up tomorrow
Well it might take years
To see through all these tears
Dont let go
When you find it you will know
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh gonna try and love again
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh gonna try and love again
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh gonna try and love again
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh
Sometimes lose sometimes win
Sometimes you need a friend
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh
Ohoh ohoh ohohoh
Gonna try
Gonna try
Gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try
Gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try
Gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try
Gonna try oohooh
Gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try
Gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try
Gonna try gonna try gonna try gonna try
Gonna try oohoohooh
