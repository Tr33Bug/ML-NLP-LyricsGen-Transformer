What kind of love have you got
You should be home but youre not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still makes you thirsty and hot
I heard about you and that man
Theres just one thing I dont understand
You say hes a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand
Victim of love I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love its such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well
Some people never come clean
Oh I think you know what I mean oh
Youre walkin the wire pain and desire
Looking for love in between
Tell me your secrets Ill tell you mine
Athis aint no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends your beenaroundtheworld friends
That talk is for losers and fools
Victim of love I see a broken heart
I could be wrong but Im not no Im not
Victim of love were not so far apart
Show me what kind of love have you got
Victim of love I see a broken heart
I could be wrong but Im not
Victim of love were not so far apart
What kind of love have you got
Victim of love youre just a victim of love
I could be wrong but Im not no Im not
Victim of love now youre a victim of love
What kind of love have you got
What kind of love have you got
What kind of love have you got
