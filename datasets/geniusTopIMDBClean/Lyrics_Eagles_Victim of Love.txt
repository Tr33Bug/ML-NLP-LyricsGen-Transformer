TranslationsEspa√±olVictim of Love Lyrics
What kind of love have you got?
You should be home, but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still makes you thirsty and hot

I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well

Some people never come clean
Oh, I think you know what I mean, oh
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between

Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
A-this ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends, your been-around-the-world friends
That talk is for losers and fools

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
What kind of love have you got?

Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?3Embed
