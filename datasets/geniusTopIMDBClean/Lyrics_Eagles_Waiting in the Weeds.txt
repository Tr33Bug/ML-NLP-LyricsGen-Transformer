Its coming on the end of August
Another summers promise almost gone
And though I heard some wise man say
That every dog will have his day
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long
I dont know when I realized the dream was over
Well there was no particular hour no given day
You know it didnt go down in flame
There was no final scene no frozen frame
I just watched it slowly fade away
And Ive been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for my time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
Ive been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though youre with somebody else
Hell never love you like I do
Ive been biding time with the crows and sparrows
While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage
If finding love is just a dance
Proximity and chance
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade
And Ive been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the dust to settle down along the
Back roads running through the fields
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town
And I imagine sunlight in your hair
Youre at the county fair
Youre holding hands and laughing
And now the ferriswheel has stopped
Youre swinging on the top
Suspended there with him
And hes the darling of the chic
The flavor of the week is melting
Down your pretty summer dress
Baby what a mess youre making
Ive been stumbling through some dark places
Now Im following the plow
I know Ive fallen out of your good graces
Its alright now
And Ive been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the
Wild birds scattering the seeds
Answering the calling of the tides eternal tune
The phases of the moon
The chambers of the heart
The egg and dart of small gray
Spiders spinning in the dark
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart
And Ive been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
Ive been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though youre with somebody else
Hell never love you like I do
