Well baby there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh my God you cant believe
Its happening again
Your babys gone and youre all alone
And it looks like the end
And youre back out on the street
And youre trying to remember oh
How do you start it over
You dont know if you can
You dont care much for a strangers touch
But you cant hold your man
You never thought youd be alone
This far down the line
And I know whats been on your mind
Youre afraid its all been wasted time
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell fell
You didnt love the boy too much
No no you just
Loved the boy too well
Farewell
So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To let them go away
And I couldve done so many things baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin what I left behind
And from worryin bout this wasted time


Oohoohoohoohooh 
Another love has come and gone
Oohoohoohoohooh 
And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
Sometimes to keep it together
Weve got to leave it alone
So you can get on with your search baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasnt really wasted time
