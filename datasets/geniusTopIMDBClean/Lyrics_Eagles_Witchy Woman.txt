Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her fingertips
Echoed voices in the night
Shes a restless spirit on an endless flight
Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye
She held me spellbound in the night  Wooooh 
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room  Wooooh 
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon
Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye
Ah oh ah ah  Waahaa 
Ah oh ah ah  Waahaa 
Ah oh ah ah
Ah oh ah ah  Waahaa 
Ah oh ah ah  Waahaa 
Ah oh ah ah
Well I know you want a lover let me tell you brother
Shes been sleeping in the devils bed
And theres some rumors going round someones underground
She can rock you in the night time til your skin turns red


Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye
