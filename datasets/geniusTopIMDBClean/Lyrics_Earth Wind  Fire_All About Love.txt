To run down a couple of things
About things we see everyday
Now I want you to stop
Whatever youre doing
Just stop
Cause Im gonna rap to you
You know they say theres beauty
In the eyes of the beholder you know
Which I say is a natural fact
Because you are as beautiful
As your thoughts right on
You know like with us for instance
You know like we study all kinds of occult sciences
And astrology and mysticism and world religion
And so forth you dig
And like ah coming from a hip place
All these things help
Because they give you an insight
To your inner self
Have mercy
Now theres an outer self we got to deal with you know
The one that like to go to parties
One that like to dress up and be cool
And look pretty on egotrips and all this
So now hey yall tryin to tell you
You gotta love you
Gotta learn all the beautiful things around you
The trees and the birds
And if there aint no beauty
You gotta make some beauty
Have mercy
