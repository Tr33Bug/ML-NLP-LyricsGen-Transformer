I would be so willing
To give you all I got
Youre a special lady
Forget me not
I could be so tender
For the likes of you
Let my heart surrender
And love goes on  And love goes on 
On and on  On and on 
Your heart beats strong  Heart beats strong 
As love goes on  Yeah 
Everyday Im wishing
For that day to come
Feeling superstitious
Hoping shes the one
One day I am lonely
Next with plenty smiles
Love I find amusing
And love goes on  Love goes on 
On and on  On and on 
Your heart beats strong  Heart beats strong 
As love goes on  Love 
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa and
If we cant work it out
You should know without a doubt
I will always be the one
You can turn to
A friend until the end
No matter where weve been
Sometimes you cant hold on
You got to give it space yeah yeah
Baby we can work it out
Yes I really love you
And without a doubt
I can make you happy
Plant good memories
That will last forever

And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on
Loves tender
And with you in mind
Now my heart surrenders
Just to make you mine

On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on
And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
