Dance boogie wonderland hah hah
Dance boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face
And says Baby uh uh it dont work
You say your prayers though you dont care
You dance and shake the hurt
Dance boogie wonderland hah hah
Dance boogie wonderland  Ooh ooh ooh dance yeah 
Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
Ooh ooh ooh ooh dance ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Dance ooh ooh ooh dance 
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
Dance ooh ooh ooh dance ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Dance ooh ooh ooh dance 
All the love in the world cant be gone
All the need to be loved cant be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying  Oh
