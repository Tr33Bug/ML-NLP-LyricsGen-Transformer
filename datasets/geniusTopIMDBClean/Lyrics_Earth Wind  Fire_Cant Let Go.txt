Love thats born in truth
All the doubt removed
Lovers eyes are blessed
Only see the best
I cant let go
Of a love that grows
Youre my woman baby love
You know I love you so
Empty hearts are free
Bring your love to me
Soul chase the moon oh babe
Shadows hug the room
Turn off the light
Sneak in bed at night
Darkness shuts its eyes baby
I open mine to you
I cant let go of a love that grows
You know I love you so
Oh woah oh oh
Cant let go know I love you so
I cant let go
Of a love that grows
Youre my woman baby love
You know I love you so
I love you so I
I love you oh
I cant let go
Of a love that grows  Of a love that grows 
Youre my woman baby love
You know I love you so
I cant let go  Cant let go 
Of a love that grows
Youre my woman baby love
You know I love you so

I cant let go  I cant let go 
Of a love that grows  Of a love that grows 
Youre my woman baby love
You know I love you so
I cant let go  I cant let go 
Of a love that grows  Of a love that grows 
Youre my woman baby love
You know I love you so
