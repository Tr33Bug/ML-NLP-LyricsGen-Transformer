Celebrate Lyrics
Gonna celebrate, yeah
Gonna celebrate, yeah
Gonna celebrate, yeah
Gonna celebrate

Seasons change, they rearrange
So why can't you and I?
Say, why can't you and I? Say, why?
Thoughts we find are so unkind
We often have to cry
But why we have to cry? But why?
Celebrate, change your thoughts to love
Celebrate what you're thinking of
Time ain't long, soon we'll be moving
Moving on
Celebrate, change your thoughts to love
Celebrate what you're thinking of
Time ain't long, soon we'll be moving
Moving on

Nature's way for her to say in perfect harmony
Believe in harmony, believe
Find your place, your past erased for life's new destiny
With peace, your destiny, with peace

Celebrate, change your thoughts to love
Celebrate what you're thinking of
Time ain't long, soon we'll be moving
Moving on

Celebrate, celebrate, change your thoughts to love (Change your thoughts to love)
Celebrate what you're thinking of (What you're thinking of, what you're thinking of)
Time ain't, time ain't long, soon we'll be moving (Soon we'll be moving)You might also likeEmbed
