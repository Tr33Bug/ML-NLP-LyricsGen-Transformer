Do you remember the 25th night of December
Love was changin the minds of pretenders
While chasin the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin in the key that our souls were singin
As we danced in the night remember
How the stars stole the night away oh yeah
Hey hey hey
Badee ya say do you remember
Badee ya dancin in December
Badee ya never was a cloudy day
Ba duda ba duda ba duda badu
Ba duda badu ba duda badu
Ba duda badu ba duda
My thoughts are with you holdin hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love remember
The true love we share today
