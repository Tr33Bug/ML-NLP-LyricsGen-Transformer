Devotion (Live) Lyrics
Thank you!
We love y'all, too
We believe if there's anything y'all, you wanna do in life, you need devotion
Can I hear a "Right on"?
Come on and clap your hands, y'all
Sing this song with us, y'all

Through devotion
Blessed are the children
Praise the teachers
That brings true love to many (Yeah)
Your devotion
Opens all life's treasures, yeah
And deliverance
From the fruits of evil

So our mission (So our mission)
To bring a melody (Just to bring y'all a melody)
Ringin' voices, woo-woo, ooh
Bring sweet harmony (Ohh)

For you here's a song (Here's a song)
To make your day brighter (Your day brighter, oh)
One that will last you long (Last you long)
Through troubled days (Through, through troubled days)

Giving your heart, ooh
The light to brighten, yeah
All of the dark (All of the dark)
That falls in your way (If it falls in your way), well, ooh, yeah, yeah

You need devotion (You need devotion, yeah)
Bless the children (Well, yeah)
Deliverance (Ahh, ooh)
From the fruits of evil (From the fruits of evil, yeah)
You need devotion (You need devotion)
Bless the children (Why don't you bless the children?)
Deliverance (Ahh, ooh)
From the fruits of evil (From the fruits of evil, ooh, yeah)
