Are you satisfied in your life and time
Does it clear you mind all the hurt you find
Built on Mother Earth
And were meant to stay
Nations bloom today
On gifts of yesterday
Born of the Earth are natures children
Fed by the Wind the breath of life
Judged by the Fiery hands of God
World moves by the hand of the master plan
Cant you understand youre but a grain of sand
Do you need a guide to make you feel satisfied
Head to the sky will tell you why
Born of the Earth are natures children
Fed by the Wind the breath of life
Judged by the Fiery hands of God
Do you need a guide make you feel satisfied
Can you understand youre but a grain of sand
When you search the sky does it make you cry
Ohhh do you understand aint nothin but a big ol man
