Evil runnin through our brain
We and evil is about the same
Bad blood through our body flows
Wheres the love nobody knows
Nobody knows 
Nobody knows 
Nobody knows 
Beauty in our face you see
Tryin to hide all our misery
Our misery 
Our misery 
Our misery 
But evil runnin through our brain
We and evil are about the same oh yeah
Evil in our life
Evil causin strife yeah yeah
Evil 
Lookin for a place to guide
A little light in our souls and minds oh yeah
Maybe if we learn to pray
Life would give us sunshiny days
Sunshiny days 
Sunshiny days 
Sunshiny days 
And evil its runnin through our brains
Turn to love and wont be the blame
Wont be the blame 
Wont be the blame 
Wont be the blame 
Evil in our life
Evil causin strife
Evil
