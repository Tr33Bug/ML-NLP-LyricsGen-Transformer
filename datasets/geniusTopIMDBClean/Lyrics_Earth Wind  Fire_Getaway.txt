So you say you tried
But you just cant find the pleasure
People around you givin you pressure
Try to resist all the hurt thats all around you
If you taste it it will haunt you
So come take me by the hand
Well leave this troubled land
I know we can I know we can I know we can I know we can
Getaway
Lets leave today
Lets getaway
Watch for the signs
That lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
Theyll show you the way
To what you have been seeking
To ignore them youre only cheating
So come take me by the hand
Well leave this troubled land
I know we can getaway
Getaway
Lay awake every night
Til the sun comes up in the morning
Nothing exciting it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
To your road you just dont doubt it
So come take me by the hand
Well leave this troubled land
I know we can I know we can I know we can I know we can
