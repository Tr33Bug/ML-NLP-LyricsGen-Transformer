Come and tell us your fears
We can get your mind clear
Put your hands in youll understand
When your souls sense is clean
Insights line up your dreams
See the symbols to know the plan
If you breathe in the Love
You become one of us
If you draw from the root
Youll blossom the truth
Dont fly were flown
Dont reach were grown
Lifes not your own
Were not alone
Dont fly were flown
Dont reach were grown
Lifes not your own
Were not alone
If youre looking for the life thats in you  whatchu do 
And you tryna figure how you gon do
Let the Guiding Lights take ya
Ooooooo
Taste your situation
Digest confirmation
Feed your needs and be in health
Vibe with Lifes frequencies
Ancestors speak in themes
Work in seasons to learn yourself
Feel our whole energy
All our souls symmetries
So keep your head to the sky
And let the clouds tell you why
Dont fly were flown
Dont reach were grown
Lifes not your own
Were not alone
Dont fly were flown
Dont reach were grown
Lifes not your own
Were not alone
If youre looking for the life thats in you  whatchu do 
And you tryna figure how you gon do
Let the Guiding Lights take ya
Take you away
Take you away
