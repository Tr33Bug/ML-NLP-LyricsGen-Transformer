I Can Feel It in My Bones LyricsI can feel it in my bones
Love is just around the corner
You don't have to be alone
Only if you really wanna
And I'm gonna say that one more time this evenin'
I can feel it in my bones
Love is just around the corner
You don't have to be alone, no no no
Only if you really wanna
Listen now
I can feel it, can't you feel it? come on
I can feel it way down in my bones
I can feel it in my bones
Love is just around the corner
You don't have to be alone
Only if you really wanna
I can feel it in my bones
Love is just around the corner
You don't have to be alone, no no no
Only if you really wanna
Wake up one mornin'
Find a brand new day
Good love vibrations
Everything's goin' your way
One day you'll see a sky of blue, yeah yeah
I know the sun gonna shine on you, yeah yeah
Listen to me
Love is around the corner
Love is around the corner
Love is around the corner, yeah
