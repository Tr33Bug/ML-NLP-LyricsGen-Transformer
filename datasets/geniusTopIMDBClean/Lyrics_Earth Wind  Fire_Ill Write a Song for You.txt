I thirst but never quench
I know the consequence feeling as I do
Were in a spinning top
Where tell me will it stop
And what am I to say
Open our music book that only few can look
And Ill write a song for you
Love is a symphony hearts in one melody
Cause Ill write a song for you
Sounds never dissipate
They only recreate in another place
Theres in your silent night
Joy of a songs delight
Cause Ill write a song for you
Youll write a song for me
Well write a song of love of love
My magical mystique
Finding it all complete
In your lovely face
Feelings we try to chase
Memories that wont erase
Stay forever new
We have a magic box in which is never locked
Cause Ill write a song for you
Youll write a song for me
Well write a song of love of love yeah
We write a song of love my baby
Write a song of love
You for you you for you you you 
We have a magic box
We write a song of love
We write write a song of love
Sounds they never dissipate
They only recreate
To another place or time
We write a song we write a song
Just you and me baby
Were Were on a spinning top
We write a song
We write a song
We write a song
