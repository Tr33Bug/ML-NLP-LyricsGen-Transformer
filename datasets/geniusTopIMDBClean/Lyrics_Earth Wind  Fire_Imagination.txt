Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
Theres a thousand voices whispering
Songs and youre the melody
So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
Its not hard to conceive
Loves ecstasy imagining you and me
Many many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
Ooo and that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
Its not hard to conceive
Loves ecstasy imagining you imagining me
The beauty we both can see
Youre the dream I prayed would come along
To make real my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
Youre the flame of love to me
So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination will do
Its not hard to conceive
Loves ecstasy imagining you imagining me
The beauty we both can see
