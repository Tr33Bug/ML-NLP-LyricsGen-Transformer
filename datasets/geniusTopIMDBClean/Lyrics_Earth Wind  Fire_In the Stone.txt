I found that love provides the key
Unlocks the heart and souls of you and me
Love will learn to sing your song yeah
Love is written in the stone
Every man I meet is walking time
Free to wander past his conscious mind
Love will come and take you home yeah
Love is written in the stone
Do you believe my friend in what you claim
People of the world all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own yeah
Truth is truth is written in the stone
In the stone youll find the meaning
Youre not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all
Life experience a passing day
Time will witness what the old folks say
Getting stronger every day
Strength is strength is written in the stone
Deep inside your heart for you to keep
Lies a spark of light that never sleeps
The greatest love you ever known
Love is love is written in the stone
In the stone youll find the meaning
Youre not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all
Never never my darling
Never youll be alone
Never never my darling
Never youll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never never my darling
Never youll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone
Never never my darling
Never youll be alone
Ever forever my darling
