Gettin down theres a party in motion
Everybodys on the scene
And I can hear the sound like the roar of an ocean
As it rushes to the stream
Live it up dont ya hear people screamin
Gotta do it all their way
Until they burn it up and the lights nowhere gleaming
What a price to have to pay
Why do we feel we have to feed the fire
Were only caught up in our desire ooh
Ive had enough its just too tough
To keep it up so Im calling out to you
To lift us up the world is rough
Im so tired and Ive had enough
Spinnin round in perpetual motion
Like a crystal ball of dreams
And moving in the crowd theres a hint of a notion
That you never will be seen
Slow it down feel some emotion
Cause theres nothing in between
Reaching that higher ground but your faith and devotion
To be on the winnin team
Why do we feel we have to feed the fire
Were only caught up in our own desire ooh
Ive had enough its just too tough
To keep it up so Im calling out to you
To lift us up the world is rough
Im so tired and Ive had enough
Yes Ive had enough
Stop Ive had enough
Hey Ive had enough

Why do we feel we have to feed the fire
Were only caught up in our own desire ooh
Ive had enough its just too tough
To keep it up so Im calling out to you
To lift us up the world is rough
And Im so tired
You know its got to stop
Ive had enough its just too tough
To keep it up so Im calling out to you
To lift us up the world is rough
And Im so tired
You know its got to stop
