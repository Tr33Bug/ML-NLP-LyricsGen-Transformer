Iâ€™ve Had Enough LyricsGettin' down, there's a party in motion
Everybody's on the scene
And I can hear the sound, like the roar of an ocean
As it rushes to the stream
Live it up, don't ya hear people screamin'
Gotta do it all their way
Until they burn it up and the lights nowhere gleaming
What a price to have to pay
Why do we feel we have to feed the fire?
We're only caught up in our desire, ooh
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I'm calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
I'm so tired and I've had enough
Spinnin' round in perpetual motion
Like a crystal ball of dreams
And moving in the crowd, there's a hint of a notion
That you never will be seen
Slow it down, feel some emotion
'Cause there's nothing in between
Reaching that higher ground, but your faith and devotion
To be on the winnin' team
Why do we feel we have to feed the fire?
We're only caught up in our own desire, ooh
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I'm calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
I'm so tired and I've had enough
Yes, I've had enough
Stop, I've had enough
Hey I've had enough

We're only caught up in our own desire, ooh
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I'm calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
And I'm so tired
You know it's got to stop
I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I'm calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
And I'm so tired
You know it's got to stopEmbed
