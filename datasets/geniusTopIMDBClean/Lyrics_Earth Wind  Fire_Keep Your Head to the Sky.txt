Master told me one day
Id find peace in every way
But in search for the clue
Wrong things I was bound to do
Keep my head to the sky
For the clouds to tell me why
As I grew and with strength
Master kept me as I repent
And he said
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky
He gave me the will to be free
Purpose to live His reality
Hey and I found myself never alone
Chances came to make me strong
To step right up and be a man
Cause you need faith to understand
So were saying for you to hear
Keep your head in faiths atmosphere
Keep your head to the sky
So the clouds
Keep your head to the sky
So they can tell you why Lord
Keep your head to the sky
Surely the clouds are gonna tell you why
