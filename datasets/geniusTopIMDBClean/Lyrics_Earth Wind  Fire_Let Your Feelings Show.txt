Hehehe hoohohoh 
Woke up Sunday morning
Feeling out of tune
Wrapped my eyes around you
Love came in the room
Babe  Babe 
Gonna let my feelings show  Gonna let my feelings show 
Everyday  Everyday  gonna learn to love you more  Haha 
Laughing into midnight
Lover be my guide
We approach the morning
Feeling good inside
Baby  Aw man 
Gonna let my feelings show  Gonna let my feelings show 
Everyday  Yeahyeah  gonna learn to love you more  Huh 
Paying dues and changes
Living day to day
Love is necessary
To help you find the way
Baby
Gonna let my feelings show  Gonna let my feelings show 
Everyday  Everyday 
Start not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care you must dare
To be free as the air  Air 


Fairy tales and stories
That we fail to see
We will tell the story
Our reality
Babe  Babe 
Gonna let my feelings show  Gonna let my feelings show 
Everyday gonna learn to love you more
Tingle in our heartbeat
Rapture on the cloud
Softer words are spoken
Action speak out loud
Baby
Gonna let my feelings show  Gonna let my feelings show 
Everyday  Everyday 
Start not to hide
What you feel deep inside
If you care you must dare
To be free as the air
