Walk around why wear a frown
Say little people try to put you down
What you need a helpin hand
All the strength at your command
Hows ya faith Cause ya faith is you
Who you kiddin To yourself be true
Spread ya love for a brighter day
For what ya search youll find a way
We are people of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you cant run from
Eagles fly every seven days
Still cryin the blues all about ya pay
What ya gonna do bout your living thang
Will ya make it better or just complain
Every day is real dont run from fear
Cause better days are very near
There are times when youre bound to cry
One more time head to the sky
We are people of the mighty
Mighty people of the sun
In our hearts lies all the answers
To the truth you cant run from
