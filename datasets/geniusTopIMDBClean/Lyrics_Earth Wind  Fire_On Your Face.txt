Ohoohwoahoohwoahoohwoah 
Aint it funny that the way you feel shows on your face
And no matter how you try to hide it states your case
Now a frown will bring your spirits down to the ground
And never let you see the good things all around
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck run out and the wind wont blow
But that cant make me sad just cant make me
Woah cause Ive been there before dont wanna go no more
Wont let them take me wont let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race keep a smilin face
Help you set your pace
Ohoohwoahoohwoahoohwoah 
Wish upon a sunny day itll turn to rain
Use the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain
We wonder how your attitude is going down
Is it waking and shaking and safe and sound
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck runs out and the wind wont blow
But that cant make me sad just cant make me
Woah cause Ive been there before dont wanna go no more
Wont let them take me wont let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race keep a smilin face
Life is on your case
Yes it is yeah
This world cant shake me  This world cant shake me 
Bad times cant make me sad
Woah cause Ive been there before dont wanna go no more
Wont let them take me wont let it drive me mad
Ohoohwoahoohwoahoohwoah 
You cant shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow Ill feel the same old way
Aint it funny that the way you feel shows on your face
Yeah yeah yeah

Use the sunshine in your heart  Ohoohwoahoohwoahoohwoah 
You cant shake me the way I feel today
