On Your Face Lyrics
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
And no matter how you try to hide, it states your case
Now a frown will bring your spirits down to the ground
And never let you see the good things all around
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck run out and the wind won't blow
But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Help you set your pace
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

Wish upon a sunny day, it'll turn to rain
Use the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain
We wonder how your attitude is going down
Is it waking and shaking and safe and sound?
Every time we seem to let our feelings flow
Our luck runs out and the wind won't blow

But that can't make me sad, just can't make me
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
Sadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life
While you run your race, keep a smilin' face
Life is on your case

Yes it is, yeah
This world can't shake me (This world can't shake me)
Bad times can't make me sad
Woah, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more
Won't let them take me, won't let it drive me mad
(Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow, I'll feel the same old way
Ain't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wake me, my heart is feeling glad
I'll take you with me when you're feeling bad
Use the sunshine in your heart (Oh-ooh-woah-ooh-woah-ooh-woah)

You can't shake me the way I feel today
Come tomorrow, I'll feel the same old way
I start to wonder what's goin' down, gotta feel it, feel it
Wake me, my heart is feeling glad
I'll take you with me when you're feeling bad
I start to wonder what's going down
In your life, is it safe and sound?
I start to wonder, is your life alright?
Are you dealing with it every day it cause you strife?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
