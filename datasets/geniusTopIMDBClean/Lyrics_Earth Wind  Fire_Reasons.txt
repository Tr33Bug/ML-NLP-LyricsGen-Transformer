Now Im craving your body is this real
Temperatures rising I dont want to feel
Im in the wrong place to be real
And Im longing to love you just for a night
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
Please let me love you
With all my might
Reasons the reasons that were here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings wont disappear
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
After all our reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all our reasons love
Love was left aside
Im longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might baby
Ooh baby
Yeah reasons the reasons that were here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings wont disappear
And after the love games have been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade
And in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
Find our reasons our reasons our reasons
Had no pride
After all our reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all our reasons love
Love was left aside
Yeah where yeah where ooh baby
I cant find the reasons
That my love wont disappear
Cant find the reasons
Why I love you baby my dear
Cant find the reasons
Wanna love you all night
Cant find the reasons
Gotta squeeze ya real tight
Cant find the reasons
Baby yeah
For my tears
Cant find the reasons
Why I love ya
