One two three four
It was Saturday night the moon was bright shining
Saturday night shining down
It was Saturday night the moon was bright
Shining down its harvest light
Music all around to hear
Set the stage and atmosphere
Many dress to suit their taste
Participate in the ego race
Tonights the night for you to be
Biggest man in history
Saturday nights your curtain call
You found your place after all
I saw a face now in the crowd
Saying nothing talking loud
Life is just a day
Living games we play
London Bridge is falling down
Do what Simon says
Doing what you feel
Games can be unreal
Humpty Dumpty when you fall
Therell be no one here to call
Life is still your mystery
You see you see you see
Many friends who gather round
And hope to feel safe and sound
We emphasize to make it clear
Our stumbling nations atmosphere

While looking through the looking glass
Our visions show a stormy past
When you gonna wake and see the sun
Stop wasting time and having fun yeah
Life is just a day
Daily games you play
London Bridge has fallen down
You did what Simon said
Doing what you feel
Games are so unreal
Humpty Dumpty whyd you fall
You see theres no one here to call
Now weve solved this mystery
You see you see you see
Doing what you feel could be unreal
Life is just a day
Life is still a mystery
Daily games we play
