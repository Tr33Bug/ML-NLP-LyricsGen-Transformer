When I see your face
Like the mornin sun
You spark me to shine
Tell all the world
My need is fulfilled
And thats a new design
As long as youre near
There is no fear
Of a victory
But when Im away
Influences stray
My mind to disagree
I wanna see your face
In the morning sun
Ignite my energy ow
The cause and effect of you
Has brought new meaning
In my life to me
Gonna tell the story o
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story o
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I need to see your face
Like the morning sun
Ignite my energy huh

The cause and effect of you
Has brought new meaning
In my life to me
The moments I find
When Im inclined
To do my best oh
The negative wins
When I give in
And then I lose the test
Not many times 
Gonna tell the story o
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire
Surely as life begun
You will as one
Battle with the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story o
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story o
Morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
