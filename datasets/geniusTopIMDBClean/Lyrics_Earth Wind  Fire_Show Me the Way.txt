Hey Raphael this is Maurice callin
Just callin to find out what time you
Wanna get together today with the horns
See I dont want to come out too confident
Ive traveled many roads but none quite as smooth as this
Cause you are picturesque like the morning sun
So close I think I can touch you yet the distance is so far
And I am open wide and vulnerable
Wherever you wanna take me girl Im so down to go
Just show me yeah  show me the way to your heart 
I wont let go
I promise to protect you lifes taught me many lessons
Just show me yeah  show me the way to your heart 
I wont let go
These feelings Im possessing can never be neglected
Time dont exist when Im with you
I lose myself in wondering if you feel it too
Cause I feel like dancing on the moon
Every time I look down I see the light in you yeah
And you you are like the missing part of me
I never knew that I was hollow until you filled me
And girl Im closing my eyes now take my hand
And lead me to the part of you that made me a better man
Just show me yeah  show me the way to your heart 
I wont let go
I promise to protect you lifes taught me many lessons
Just show me yeah  show me the way to your heart 
I wont let go
These feelings Im possessing cant never be neglected
Just show me yeaaah
You see love just happened to be a beautiful thing
And you see some choose to disagree
And some choose to look the other way
Love is a divine power
Sing along with Maurice yall come on
Oh ooh oh  show me the way to your heart  oh ooh oh
Baby your love is so precious to me child
Oh ooh oh  show me the way to your heart  oh ooh oh
Baby the heavens leased your soul to me child
If you can find a place  show me the way to your heart 
Somewhere in your heart baby
Come on baby come on baby
Your love is so precious to me
I feel the time is here  show me the way to your heart 
Show me your biggest heart baby
Come on lady come on lady
Your love is so precious to me 
Show me the love the mystery
Take me back to honesty
I need to feel your light so we can love in harmony
Show me the light your brightest star
Gimme your hand lets make the dance
The heart can feel  emotion we can both see love grow
Show me your love
Show me your love
Show me the love the mystery
Take me back to honesty
I need to feel your light so we can love in harmony
Show me the light your brightest star
Gimme your hand lets make the dance
The heart can feel emotion we can both see love grow
Show me your love
