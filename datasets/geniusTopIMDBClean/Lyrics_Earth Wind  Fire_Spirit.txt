Spirit LyricsMany years has passed and a day
Still we walk in a path that leads to the light
Shining down on this great beyond
Thoughts ignite us, let love unite us
Then turn your face to the wind
And taste his love within
You'll find a friend
Everlasting love you can depend
And every time you smile, you bless a child
Our spirits perpetuate
Our spirits meditate love and faith
We must make our brother see
That the light is he
Shining on you and me
And the land he gave
Roads we must pave
Looking through each other's eyes
Humanity will rise
In love
Hey, in love
In love
Yeah, in love
And our spirits
Ooo, they will be one
Yeah, they'll be one
Be oneYou might also likeEmbed
