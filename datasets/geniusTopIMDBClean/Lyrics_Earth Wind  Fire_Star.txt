In the sky shines a star
Spaces near and far
Calling out who you are
And smiling in the night
Star bright star light  Alright  beaming cross the sky
Falling calling can you tell me why
Star bright star light mighty light to see
Shining smiling down on you and me
Stars hide from the rain
It turns against the pain
Fooling many in the game
While smiling in the night
Star bright star light  Hey  beaming cross the sky
Falling calling can you tell me why
Star bright star light  Alright  mighty light to see
Shining smiling down on you and me
I can feel the dark
Take the night apart
But then the stars come out
To lift my heart
Believing theres a star for everyone
Makes it easier to recall
That together for the children of the world
Theres a star smiling for us all
Star bright star light  Hey  mighty light to see
Shining smiling down on you and me
Star bright star light  Yeah  mighty light to see
Shining smiling down on you and me


Star shining high
Cultivating my desire
Graceful in the sky
While smiling in the night
Star bright star light beaming cross the sky
Falling calling can you tell me why
Star bright star light mighty light to see
Shining smiling down on you and me
