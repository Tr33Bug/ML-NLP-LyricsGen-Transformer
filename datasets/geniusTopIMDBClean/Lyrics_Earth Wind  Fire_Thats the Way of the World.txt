Thatâ€™s the Way of the World Lyrics
Hearts afire
Creates love desire
Take you high and higher
To the world you belong
Hearts afire
Creates love desire
High and higher
To your place on the throne
We've come together on this special day (Huh)
Sing a message loud and clear (Hmm, mm)
Looking back, we've touched on sorrowful days (Well!)
Future, past, they disappear (Haw, haaaw)

You will find (You will find)
Peace of mind (Yeah, ha)
If you look way down
In your heart and soul
Ahh, don't hesitate
'Cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart
Ahh, 'cause you're never
Never old at heart (Never, never, never, never, never, never)
Oh, yeah, yeah, ha

That's the way (That's the way)
Of the world (Of the world)
Plant your flower (Gonna plant your flower)
And you grow a pearl (Heeey, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Child is born
With a heart of gold (Ooh, ah, ah, yeah)
Way of the world (Gonna plant your flower)
Makes his heart so cold
Oooh, ooh, ooh, ha, Lord
Can't you see me, y'all?
Say, hey
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Ahhh, luh
