Ive been waiting so long
Just watching the phone for you
To wait it takes
Love thats for real
And all that I feel inside to do
I come prepared to look in your eyes
And walk side by side
With you baby
Listen for tender words Id like to say
Like I love you today and Ill wait for you
Its crazy if you think were just friends
Loving when infatuation ends
The wait for you baby it now begins
You sigh when I come close to your heart
You cry from the start
Please wait for me
Your mind shows places you go
And things you dont know
Someday you will grow
Climbing a mountain high
Love I desire
Inside my heart cries for you
Listen for tender words Id like to say
Like I love you today and Ill wait for you
I never felt this way
Its crazy if you think were just friends
Loving when infatuation ends  Infatuation 
Baby were more than friends
I know the wait will end
Hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me
Baby were more than friends
I know the wait will end
Baby baby
Baby were more than friends
I know the wait will end
