Wait LyricsI've been waiting so long
Just watching the phone for you
To wait it takes
Love that's for real
And all that I feel inside to do
I come prepared to look in your eyes
And walk side by side
With you, baby
Listen for tender words I'd like to say
Like "I love you today", and "I'll wait for you"
It's crazy if you think we're just friends
Loving when infatuation ends
The wait for you, baby, it now begins
You sigh when I come close to your heart
You cry from the start
"Please wait for me"
Your mind shows places you go
And things you don't know
Someday you will grow
Climbing a mountain high
Love I desire
Inside my heart cries for you
Listen for tender words I'd like to say
Like "I love you today", and "I'll wait for you"
I never felt this way
It's crazy if you think we're just friends
Loving when infatuation ends (Infatuation)
Baby, we're more than friends
I know the wait will end
Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Baby, we're more than friends
I know the wait will end
Baby, baby
Baby, we're more than friends
I know, the wait will endYou might also likeEmbed
