I feel it in the night
I hear a whisper a ray of light
A flash across the sky
Through the window in my eyes
A bolt of thunder
Exploding in my mind
Is it real what I feel
Its just like floating away
While the moon floods the room
I can hear music start to play
And I see it on your face
Oh what a difference lovin can make
Silence of the dark words are falling from my heart
Its all around us
All thoughts are calling
Imagination is born when loves alive
A spirit creating a place for you and I
Together lets ride away to find the universe
And let our dreams relive our lives
Were living in our own time
Love is the answer
Were living in our own time
Weve found the answer
Now Im so willing to discover
Believing forever touching each other
Nothing out there can stop us tonight
All that were feeling so right
You mean so much to me
I feel so wanted but yet so free
The warmth of your embrace
I know time could not erase
Making it easy to go on loving you
Imagination when loves alive
Ohhh you and I
Together lets ride away the universe
And let our dreams relive our lives
Were living in our own time
Love is the answer
Were living in our own time
Weve found the answer
