Would you mind if I touch if I kiss
If I held you tight in the morning light Yeah
Would you mind if I said
How I felt tenderly tonight again
Cause I never ever felt
This way in my heart before oh
Love has found its way
In my heart yeah
Would you mind if I looked in your eyes till
Im hypnotized and I lose my pride yeah
Would you mind if I make love to you
Till Im satisfied once again
Cause I never ever felt
Felt this way in my heart oh before oh
Love has found its way
In my heart tonight
