Would You Mind LyricsWould you mind if I touch, if I kiss
If I held you tight in the morning light? Yeah
Would you mind if I said
How I felt tenderly tonight again?
'Cause I never ever felt
This way in my heart before, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart, yeah
Would you mind if I looked in your eyes till
I'm hypnotized and I lose my pride? yeah
Would you mind if I make love to you
Till I'm satisfied once again?
'Cause I never ever felt
Felt this way in my heart oh before, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart tonightYou might also like1Embed
