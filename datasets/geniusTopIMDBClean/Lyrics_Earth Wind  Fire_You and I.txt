Baby here we are
Waiting here for time to play the game
Let love steal us away
Baby here I am
Holding charts to guide us through the storm
To a brighter brighter day
You and I will be together
Many lessons oh baby
From a past thats lived too many lies
Yesterday is gone forever theres tomorrow oh baby
All that I can see
You and I living together
You and I groovin forever
Trusting every word
Just to mean what has been handed down in time
Weve known hurt before
Masters of my dreams
Create a place to feel this love of mine
Never hurt no more
You and I will be together
Many lessons oh baby
From a past thats lived too many lies
Yesterday is gone forever theres tomorrow oh baby
All that I can see
You and I living together
You and I groovin forever
We must trust the dark
For showing us the stars
We must trust the rain
And open up our hearts
Just you and I living together
You and I groovin forever
You and I living together

Baby you and I living together
You and I groovin forever
