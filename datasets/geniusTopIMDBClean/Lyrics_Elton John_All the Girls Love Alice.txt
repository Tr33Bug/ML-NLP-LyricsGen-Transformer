Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummydoesntloveme blues
Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldnt get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick whos just sixteen
And hey hey hey  hey hey hey 
You know what I mean
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice its my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me
Wait till my husbands away
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
Its like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girls bed
And it was only last Tuesday
Oh they found you in the subway dead
And who could you call your friends down in SoHo
One or two middleaged dykes in a gogo
But what do you expect from a 16yearold yoyo
And hey hey hey  hey hey hey 
Oh dont you know


All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice its my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice theyd say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me
Wait till my husbands away
