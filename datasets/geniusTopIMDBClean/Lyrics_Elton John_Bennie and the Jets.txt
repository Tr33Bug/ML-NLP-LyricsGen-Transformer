Hey kids shake it loose together
The spotlights hitting something
Thats been known to change the weather
Well kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
Youre gonna hear electric music solid walls of sound
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Ooh but theyre so spaced out
BBBBennie and the Jets
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful
Oh Bennie shes really keen
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine oh
BBBBennie and the Jets
Hey kids plug into the faithless
Maybe theyre blinded but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find whos right and whos wrong
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Ooh but theyre so spaced out
BBBBennie and the Jets
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful
Oh Bennie shes really keen
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine oh
BBBBennie and the Jets
Oh Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet
Oh but theyre so spaced out
BBBBBBennie and the Jets
Oh but theyre weird and theyre wonderful
Oh Bennie shes really keen
Shes got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
BBBBennie and the Jets
Bennie Bennie and the Jets
Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie and the Jets
Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie and the Jets
Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie and the Jets
Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie and the Jets the Jets the Jets
Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie Bennie and the Jets
