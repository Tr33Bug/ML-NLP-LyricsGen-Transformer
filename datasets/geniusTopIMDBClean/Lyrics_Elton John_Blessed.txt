Hey you youre a child in my head
You havent walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear youll be blessed
I know youre still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that Ive ever seen
Anyway youll be blessed
And you youll be blessed
Youll have the best
I promise you that
Ill pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that promise you that promise you that
Youll be blessed
I need you before Im too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that youre blessed
