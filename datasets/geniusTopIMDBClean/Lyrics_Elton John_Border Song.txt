Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the spectre he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who aint my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and Ill have to leave
Wont you please excuse my frankness
But its not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Im going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs aint abused
I cant take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes oh
Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
Theres a man over there whats his color I dont care
Hes my brother let us live in peace oh
Hes my brother let us live in peace oh
Hes my brother let us let us live in peace
