Border Song Lyrics
Holy Moses, I have been removed
I have seen the spectre, he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses, I have been removed

Holy Moses, I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction, and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness
But it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses, I have been deceived
I'm going back to the border where my affairs
My affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes, oh
Holy Moses, I have been deceived

Holy Moses, let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there, what's his color? I don't care
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us live in peace, oh
He's my brother, let us, let us live in peaceYou might also like2Embed
