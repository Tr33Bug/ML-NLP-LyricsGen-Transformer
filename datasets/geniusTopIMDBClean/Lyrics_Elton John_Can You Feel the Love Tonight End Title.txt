Can You Feel the Love Tonight  End Title  Lyrics
Theres a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment and it sees me through
Its enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
Its enough for this wideeyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How its laid to rest
Its enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
Theres a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
Theres a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this starcrossed voyager beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
Its enough for this wideeyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How its laid to rest
Its enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
Its enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
