From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking step into the sun
Theres more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
Some say Eat or be eaten
Some say Live and let live
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give
In the circle of life
Its the wheel of fortune
Its the leap of faith
Its the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle the circle of life
Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars
Theres far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rollin high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round
In the circle of life
Its the wheel of fortune
Its the leap of faith
Its the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding yeah
In the circle the circle of life
Its the wheel of fortune yeah
Its the leap of faith
Its the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding yeah
In the circle the circle of life
On the path unwinding yeah
In the circle the circle of life
