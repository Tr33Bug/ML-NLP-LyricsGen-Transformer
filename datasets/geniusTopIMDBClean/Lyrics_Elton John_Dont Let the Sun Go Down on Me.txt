I cant light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
Im growin tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Dont let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself its always someone else I see
Id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin everything is like the sun goin down on me
I cant find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Dont discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have oh they need love to help them heal
Dont let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself its always someone else I see
Id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin everything is like the sun goin down on me
Dont let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself its always someone else I see
Id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free yeah
But losin everything is like the sun goin down on me
