Electricity  Billy Elliot  Lyrics
Can I just ask you Billy
What does it feel like when youre dancing
I cant really explain it
I havent got the words
Its a feeling that you cant control
I suppose its like forgetting losing who you are
And at the same time something makes you whole
Its like that theres a music playing in your ear
And Im listening and Im listening and then I disappear
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly Im flying flying like a bird
Like electricity electricity
Sparks inside of me
And Im free Im free
Its a bit like being angry
Its a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
Its like when youve been crying
And youre empty and youre full
I dont know what it is its hard to tell
Its like that theres a music playing in your ear
But the music is impossible impossible to hear
But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly Im flying flying like a bird
Like electricity electricity
Sparks inside of me
And Im free Im free

Electricity sparks inside of me
And Im free Im free
Im free Free Im free
