Funeral for a Friend
Love Lies Bleeding
The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh it doesnt seem a year ago to this very day
You said Im sorry honey if I dont change the pace
I cant face another day
And love lies bleedin in my hands
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldnt hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleedin in my hands
I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin hoops of fire that you and I passed through
Youre a bluebird on a telegraph line I hope youre happy now
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
Youll make it back somehow
And love lies bleedin in my hands
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldnt hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleedin in my hands
And love lies bleedin in my hands
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldnt hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleedin in my hands


Oh
Oh
Oh oh oh oh
Love lies bleedin in my hands
Oohhoo Oohhoo Oohhoo
Oohhoo Oohhoo Oohhoo
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
