When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you cant hold me forever
I didnt sign up with you
Im not a present for your friends to open
This boys too young to be singin the blues
Ah ahah ahah
Ahahah ah
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You cant plant me in your penthouse
Im goin back to my plough
Back to the howlin old owl in the woods
Huntin the hornyback toad
Oh Ive finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
Ah ahah ahah
Ahahah ah
What do you think youll do then
I bet theyll shoot down the plane
Itll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe youll get a replacement
Theres plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who aint got a penny
Sniffin for tidbits like you on the ground
Ah ahah ahah
Ahahah ah
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You cant plant me in your penthouse
Im goin back to my plough
Back to the howlin old owl in the woods
Huntin the hornyback toad
Oh Ive finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
Ah ahah ahah
Ahahah ah
