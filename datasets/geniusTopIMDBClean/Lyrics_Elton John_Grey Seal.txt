Whys it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain and never say Good day to the newborn
On the big screen they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
Its never quite the same as the real one
And tell me grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise
To see through eyes that only see whats real
Tell me grey seal
I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye
And tell me grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise
To see through eyes that only see whats real
Tell me grey seal
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly then so can I
And tell me grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise
To see through eyes that only see whats real
Tell me grey seal
