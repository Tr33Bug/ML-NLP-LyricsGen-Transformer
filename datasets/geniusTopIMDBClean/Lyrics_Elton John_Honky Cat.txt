When I look back boy I must have been green
Bopping in the country fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights honey I was blind
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh change is gonna do me good
You better get back honky cat
Living in the city aint where its at
Its like trying to find gold in a silver mine
Its like trying to drink whisky oh from a bottle of wine
Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those highclass ladies down in New Orleans
And all the fools back home well said I was a fool
They said oh Believe in the Lord is the golden rule
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
But I quit those days and my redneck ways
And ooh oh change is gonna do me good
Ooh baby 
They said get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
And oh oh change is gonna do me good
They said stay at home boy you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city boy is is gonna break your heart
But how can you stay when your heart says no
Ha how can you stop when your feet say go
You better get back honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
And ooh oh the change is gonna do me good
You better get back honky cat
Living in the city aint where its at
Its like trying to find gold in a silver mine
Its like trying to drink whisky oh from a bottle of wine
Oh yeah get back honky cat
Get back honky cat get back whoo
Get back honky cat
Get back honky cat get back whoo
Oh get back honky cat get back
Get back honky cat whoo
Oh yeah redneck ways and
Whoo
