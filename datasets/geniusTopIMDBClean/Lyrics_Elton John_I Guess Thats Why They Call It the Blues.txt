Dont wish it away
Dont look at it like its forever
Between you and me I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while Im away
Dust out the demons inside
And it wont be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin like children livin like lovers
Rollin like thunder under the covers
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget Im your man
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin like children livin like lovers
Rollin like thunder under the covers
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin like children livin like lovers
Rollin like thunder under the covers
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
Laughing like children living like lovers 
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
Laughing like children living like lovers 
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
And I guess thats why they call it the blues
