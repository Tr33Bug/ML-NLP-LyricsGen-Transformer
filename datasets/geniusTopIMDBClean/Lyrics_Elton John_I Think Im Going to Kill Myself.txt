Im getting bored
Being part of mankind
Theres not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think Ill buy a 44
Give em all a surprise
I think Im gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah Im gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
Id like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
A rift in my family
I cant use the car
I gotta be in by ten oclock
Who do they think they are
Id make an exception
If you wanna save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night
I think Im gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah Im gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
Id like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
On the state of teenage blues
Kill myself
Suicide
What a scandal if I die
Suicide
Headline news
On the state of teenage blues
