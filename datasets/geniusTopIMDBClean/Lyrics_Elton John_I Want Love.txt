I want love but its impossible
A man like me so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
And I cant love shot full of holes
Dont feel nothing I just feel cold
Dont feel nothing just old scars
Toughening up around my heart
But I want love just a different kind
I want love wont break me down
Wont brick me up wont fence me in
I want a love that dont mean a thing
Thats the love I want I want love
I want love on my own terms
After everything Ive ever learned
Me I carry too much baggage
Oh man Ive seen so much traffic
But I want love just a different kind
I want love wont break me down
Wont brick me up wont fence me in
I want a love that dont mean a thing
Thats the love I want I want love
So bring it on Ive been bruised
Dont give me love thats clean and smooth
Im ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance Ive had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
But I want love just a different kind
I want love wont break me down
Wont brick me up wont fence me in
I want a love that dont mean a thing
Thats the love I want I want love
I want love just a different kind
I want love wont break me down
Wont brick me up wont fence me in
I want a love that dont mean a thing
Thats the love I want I want love
