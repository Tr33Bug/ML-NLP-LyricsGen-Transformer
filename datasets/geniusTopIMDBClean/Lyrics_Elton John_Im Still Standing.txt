You could never know what its like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And theres a cold lonely light that shines from you
Youll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me Im acomin back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while Im still standin
You just fade away
Dont you know Im still standin better than I ever did
Lookin like a true survivor feelin like a little kid
And Im still standin after all this time
Pickin up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Once I never coulda hoped to win
Youre startin down the road leavin me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus youd be a clown by now
You know Im still standin better than I ever did
Lookin like a true survivor feelin like a little kid
And Im still standin after all this time
Pickin up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Dont you know that Im still standin better than I ever did
Lookin like a true survivor feelin like a little kid
And Im still standin after all this time
Pickin up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah 
Im still standin  yeah yeah yeah
