I see your teeth flash Jamaican honey so sweet
Down where Lexington cross 47th street
Oh shes a big girl shes standin sixfootthree
Turnin tricks for the dudes in the big city
Island girl
What you wantin with your white mans world
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl island girl island girl
Tell me what you wantin with your white mans world
Well shes black as coal but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a wellworn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake
Oh he one more gone he one more John who make the mistake
Island girl
What you wantin with your white mans world
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl island girl island girl
Tell me what you wantin with your white mans world
Island girl
What you wantin with your white mans world
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you but the cause is lost
Island girl island girl island girl
Tell me what you wantin with your white man
Tell me what you wantin with your white man
Tell me what you wantin with your white man
