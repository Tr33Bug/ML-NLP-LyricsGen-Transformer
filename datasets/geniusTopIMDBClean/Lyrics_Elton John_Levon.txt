Levon Lyrics
Levon bears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot, they say
Spends his days countin'
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing, watchin' them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailin'
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said "God is dead
And the War's begun"
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
Whoo! And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
