I can see very well
Theres a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
Theres a joke and I know it very well
Its one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word Im a madman dont you know
Once a fool had a good part in the play
If its so would I still be here today
Its quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think its very funny everything I say
Get a load of him hes so insane
You better get your coat dear it looks like rain
Well come again next Thursday afternoon
The Inlaws hope theyll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that youre after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water
I can see very well
Theres a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
Theres a joke and I know it very well
Its one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word Im a madman dont you know
The grounds a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted
Will they come again next week can my mind really take it
Well come again next Thursday afternoon
The Inlaws hope theyll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that youre after
Another glimpse of the Madman across the Water
