Can you hear it in the distance
Can you sense it far away
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer
Is it Santa on his sleigh
Its heading up to Easington
Its coming down the Tyne
Oh Its bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine
So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May Gods love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos its one day closer to your death
Theyve come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But dont be too downhearted
Its all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay so
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May Gods love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos its one day closer to your death
And theyve brought their fascist bootboys
And theyve brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And theyll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos theyre privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time so


Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May Gods love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos its one day closer to your death
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May Gods love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos its one day closer to your death
Oh my darling oh my darling
Oh my darling Heseltine
Youre a tosser youre a wanker
And youre just a Tory Swine
