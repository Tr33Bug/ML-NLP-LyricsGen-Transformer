In life one has to face a huge assortment
Of nauseating fads and good advice
Theres health and fitness diet and deportment
And other pointless forms of sacrifice
Conversation Wit I am a doubter
Manners Charm Theyre no way to impress
So forget the inner me observe the outer
I am what I wear and how I dress
Oh now I believe in lookin
Like my time on earth is cookin
Whether polka dotted striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fiber on of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect
From your cradle via trousseau
To your deathbed youre on view so
Never compromise accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
For my dress has always beenmy strongest suit
Overwear underwear anytime anywhere 
Staying in or hitting townwards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time  Is stitched in time 
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously is a crime  Its such a crime 
And the few who are invited  Overwear 
To my wardrobe are delighted  Underwear 
As they wander through my things  Anytime 
To find en route  Were wandering through your things 
That in negligee or formal  Negligee 
I am anything but normal  Anything but normal 
And dress has always been my strongest suit
Overwear underwear anytime anywhere 
Overwear underwear anytime anywhere 
I am what I wear
Overwear underwear anytime anywhere 
I said anytime
Overwear underwear anytime anywhere 
Anywhere
So bring me all my finest  Finest 
Most audacious my divinest  Divinest
