I used to be a rollin stone you know
If a cause was right
Id leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done
Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born Ive waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me kneehigh to a man yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light shine the light
Shine the light wont you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom I looove ya
Yes I do
If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city  Some people choose the city 
Some others choose the good old family home
Some others choose the good old family home 
I like livin easy without family ties  Livin easy 
Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes
Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born Ive waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me kneehigh to a man
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had
Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light shine the light
Shine the light wont you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom I looove ya yes I do


Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me
I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light shine the light
Shine the light wont you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom I looove ya
You know I looove ya yeah
You know I looove you yes I do
Philadelphia freedom

You know that I looove you yes I do
