Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton I mustve played them all
But I aint seen nothin like him in any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
He stands like a statue becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers always playing clean
He plays by intuition the digit counters fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
Hes a pinball wizard there has to be a twist
A pinball wizards got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it  I dont know
What makes him so good 
Well he aint got no distractions cant hear no buzzes and bells
Dont see lights aflashin he plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
He cant beat me now Ive always been the champ
I know every trick no freaks gonna beat my hand
Oh cant explain 
Oh cant explain 
Oh cant explain 
Oh cant explain 
Even on my usual table he can beat the best
His disciples lead him in and he just does the rest
Hes got crazy flipper fingers Ive never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
Hes a pinball wizard there has to be a twist
A pinball wizards got such a supple wrist
Hes a pinball wizard he scores a trillion more
A pinball wizard the worlds new pinball lord
Hes scoring more hes scoring more
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
To him to him
