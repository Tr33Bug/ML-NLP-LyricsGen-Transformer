Rocket Man  I Think Its Going to Be a Long Long Time  Lyrics
She packed my bags last night preflight
Zero hour 9 am
And Im gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much I miss my wife
Its lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
And I think its gonna be a long long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
Im not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no
Im a rocket man
Rocket man burnin out his fuse up here alone
And I think its gonna be a long long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
Im not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no
Im a rocket man
Rocket man burnin out his fuse up here alone
Mars aint the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact its cold as hell
And theres no one there to raise them if you did
And all the science I dont understand
Its just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man
And I think its gonna be a long long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
Im not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no
Im a rocket man
Rocket man burnin out his fuse up here alone
And I think its gonna be a long long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
Im not the man they think I am at home
Oh no no no
Im a rocket man
Rocket man burnin out his fuse up here alone
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
And I think its gonna be a long long time
