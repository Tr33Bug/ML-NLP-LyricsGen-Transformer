Its a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptations strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin
And negativity lands
Cold cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin better baby
Just passin through
And its no sacrifice
Just a simple word
Its two hearts livin
In two separate worlds
But its no sacrifice
No sacrifice
Its no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstandin
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns
Cold cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin better baby
Just passin through
And its no sacrifice
Just a simple word
Its two hearts livin
In two separate worlds
But its no sacrifice
No sacrifice
Its no sacrifice at all
Cold cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin better baby
Just passin through
And its no sacrifice
Just a simple word
Its two hearts livin
In two separate worlds
But its no sacrifice
No sacrifice
Its no sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
No sacrifice at all
