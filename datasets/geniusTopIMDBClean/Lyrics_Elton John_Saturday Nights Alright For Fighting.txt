Saturday Nights Alright  For Fighting  Lyrics
Its getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
Its seven oclock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old mans drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she dont care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Oh dont give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh Saturday nights alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
Cause Saturday nights the night I like
Saturday nights alright alright alright ooh
Well theyre packed pretty tight in here tonight
Im looking for a dolly wholl see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out Shes with me
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
Im a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
Oh dont give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday nights alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
Cause Saturday nights the night I like
Saturday nights alright alright alright ooh
Oh dont give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Cause Saturday nights alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
Cause Saturday nights the night I like
Saturday nights alright alright alright ooh
Saturday Saturday Saturday
Saturday Saturday Saturday
Saturday Saturday Saturday nights alright
Saturday Saturday Saturday
Saturday Saturday Saturday
Saturday Saturday Saturday nights alright
Saturday Saturday Saturday
Saturday Saturday Saturday
Saturday Saturday Saturday nights alright whoo
