Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams youve left so very far behind
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams youve left so very far behind
Just let me wake up in the morning to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again


Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the things youve left so very far behind
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the things youve left so very so very far behind
