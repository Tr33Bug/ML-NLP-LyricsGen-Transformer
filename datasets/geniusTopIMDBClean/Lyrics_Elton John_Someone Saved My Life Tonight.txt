When I think of those East End lights muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna lord you really shoulda been there
Sittin like a princess perched in her electric chair
And its one more beer and I dont hear you anymore
Weve all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rollin round the basement floor  Ooh 
And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear  sugar bear 
You almost had your hooks in me didnt you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altarbound hypnotized sweet freedom whispered in my ear
Youre a butterfly and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away high away byebye  Ooh 
I never realized the passin hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin in my darkest dreams
Im strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn outplayed by a dominating queen
Its four oclock in the morning damn it Listen to me good
Im sleepin with myself tonight
Saved in time thank God my musics still alive
Oh 
Someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
Sugar bear sugar bear 
You almost had your hooks in me didnt you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altarbound hypnotized sweet freedom whispered in my ear
Youre a butterfly and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away high away byebye  Ooh 
And I wouldve walked headon into the deep end of the river
Clingin to your stocks and bonds
Payin your HP demands forever
Theyre comin in the mornin with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone
Someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
Sugar bear sugar bear sugar bear 
You almost had your hooks in me didnt you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altarbound hypnotized sweet freedom whispered in my ear
Youre a butterfly and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away high away byebye
Someone saved someone saved someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight 
Someone saved someone saved someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight 
Someone saved someone saved someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight 
Someone saved someone saved someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight 
Someone saved someone saved someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight 
Someone saved someone saved someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight 
Someone saved someone saved someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
