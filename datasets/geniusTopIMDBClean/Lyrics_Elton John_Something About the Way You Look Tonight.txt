There was a time I was everything and nothin all in one
When you found me I was feelin like a cloud across the sun
Well I need to tell ya how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight you just shine like a beacon on the bay
And I cant explain
But its somethin about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
Its that feelin I get about you deep inside
And I cant describe
But its something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
With a smile you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty Im speechless and I dont know where to start
And I cant explain
But its somethin about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
Its that feelin I get about you deep inside
And I cant describe
But its something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
And I cant explain
But its somethin about the way you look tonight
Oh takes my breath away
Its that feelin I get about you deep inside
And I cant describe
But its something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look  Way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
