What have I gotta do to make you love me
What have I gotta do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that youre not there
What do I do to make you want me
What have I gotta do to be heard
What do I say when its all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word
Its sad  So sad  so sad
Its a sad sad situation
And its getting more and more absurd
Its sad  So sad  so sad
Why cant we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
Its sad  So sad  so sad
Its a sad sad situation
And its getting more and more absurd
Its sad  So sad  so sad
Why cant we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
What do I do to make you love me
Oh what have I gotta do to be heard
What do I do when lightning strikes me
What have I gotta do
What have I gotta do
Ooh and sorry seems to be the hardest word
