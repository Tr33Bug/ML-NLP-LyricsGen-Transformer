Take Me to the Pilot Lyrics
If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial
And I'm here, yeah, in your prison
Like a coin in your mint
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

Well, I know he's not old
And I'm told, and I'm told he's a virgin
Or he may be she
What I'm told is never, never for certain

Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Yeah, yeah, take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

Through a glass eye, your throne
Is the one danger zone
Take me to the pilot for control
Take me to the pilot of your soul

Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot, lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot, I am but a stranger

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na

(Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na-na-na na na)
Take me, take me, oh, oh

Na na na, na-na-na na na)
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah

Na na na, na-na-na na na)
Take me, take me, yeah, yeah, yeah
