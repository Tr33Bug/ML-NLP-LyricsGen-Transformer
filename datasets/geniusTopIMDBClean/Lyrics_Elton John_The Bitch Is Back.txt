I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain I spit in your eye
Times are changing now the poor get fat
But the fevers gonna catch you when the bitch gets back  oh 
Eat meat on Friday thats alright
I even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social dos
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue ooh
Im a bitch Im a bitch oh the bitch is back
Stonecold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch cause Im better than you
Its the way that I move the things that I do oh
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I dont like those my God whats that
Oh its full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back  oh 
Im a bitch Im a bitch oh the bitch is back
Stonecold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch cause Im better than you
Its the way that I move the things that I do oh
Oh 
Im a bitch Im a bitch oh the bitch is back
Stonecold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch cause Im better than you
Its the way that I move the things that I do oh
Bitch bitch bitch is back
Bitch bitch bitch is back
Bitch bitch bitch is back
Bitch bitch bitch is back
Bitch bitch bitch is back
Bitch bitch bitch is back
Bitch bitch bitch is back
Bitch bitch bitch is back
