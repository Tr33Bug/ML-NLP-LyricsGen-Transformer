I saw you dancin out the ocean
Runnin fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Youre all Ive ever needed
Baby youre the one
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel oh
For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Youre all Ive ever needed
Ooh baby youre the one
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh youre all I ever needed
Ooh baby youre the one
All I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh youre all I ever needed
Ooh baby youre the one
