Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
Its all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes
The full moons bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened
Its so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
Did we didnt we should we couldnt we
Im not sure cause sometimes were so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Dont you find
We all fall in love sometimes
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile
Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
Its all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes


Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
Ohohohoh Ohoh
We all fall in love sometimes
