Its a little bit funny this feeling inside
Im not one of those who can easily hide
I dont have much money but boy if I did
Id buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor heh but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know its not much but its the best I can do
My gift is my song and this ones for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that its done
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while youre in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well theyve got me quite cross
But the suns been quite kind while I wrote this song
Its for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see Ive forgotten if theyre green or theyre blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes Ive ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that its done
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while youre in the world
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while youre in the world
