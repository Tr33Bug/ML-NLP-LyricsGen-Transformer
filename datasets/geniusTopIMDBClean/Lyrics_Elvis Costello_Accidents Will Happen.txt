Oh I just dont know where to begin
Though he says hell wait forever its now or never
But she keeps him hanging on the silly champion
She says she cant go home without a chaperone
Accidents will happen we only hit and run
He used to be your victim now youre not the only one
Accidents will happen we only hit and run
I dont wanna hear it cause I know what Ive done
Theres so many fish in the sea
That only rise up in the sweat and smoke like mercury
But they keep you hanging on they say youre so young
Your mind is made up but your mouth is undone
Accidents will happen we only hit and run
He used to be your victim now youre not the only one
Accidents will happen we only hit and run
I dont wanna hear it cause I know what Ive done
And its the damage that we do and never know
Its the words that we dont say that scare me so
Theres so many people to see
So many people you can check up on and add to your collection
But they keep you hanging on until youre well hung
Your mouth is made up but your mind is undone
Accidents will happen we only hit and run
He used to be your victim now youre not the only one
Accidents will happen we only hit and run
I dont wanna hear it cause I know what Ive
I know what Ive I know what Ive done
I know I know
