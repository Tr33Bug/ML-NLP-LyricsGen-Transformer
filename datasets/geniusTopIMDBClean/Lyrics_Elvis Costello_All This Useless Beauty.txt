Its at times such as this shed be tempted to spit
If she wasnt so ladylike
She imagines how she might have lived
Back when legends and history collide
So she looks to her prince finding since hes so charmingly
Slumped at her side
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall
And shes waiting for passion or humour to strike
What shall we do what shall we do
With all this useless beauty
All this useless beauty
Good Friday arrived the sky darkened on time
Till he almost began to negotiate
She held his head like a baby and said
Its okay if you cry
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldnt guess
He desires to impress his associates
But hes part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny
What shall we do what shall we do
With all this useless beauty
All this useless beauty
She wont practice the looks from the great tragic books
That were later disgraced to face celluloid
It wont even make sense but you can bet
If she isnt his sweetheart or plaything or pet
The film turns her into an unveiled threat
Nonsense prevails modesty fails
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity
While the calendar fades almost all barricades
To a pale compromise
And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts
They still think theyre the gods of antiquity
If something you missed didnt even exist
It was just an ideal is it such a surprise


What shall we do what shall we do
With all this useless beauty
All this useless beauty
What shall we do what shall we do
With all this useless beauty
All this useless beauty
