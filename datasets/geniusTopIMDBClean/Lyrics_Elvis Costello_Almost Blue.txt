Almost blue
Almost doing things we used to do
Theres a girl here and shes almost you
Almost
All the things that your eyes once promised
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Almost blue
Its almost touching it will almost do
There is part of me thats always true
Always
Not all good things come to an end
Now it is only a chosen few
Ive seen such an unhappy couple
Almost me
Almost you
Almost blue
