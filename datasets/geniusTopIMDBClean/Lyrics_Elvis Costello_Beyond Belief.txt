History repeats the old conceits
The glib replies the same defeats
Keep your finger on important issues
With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues
Im just the oily slick
On the windup world of the nervous tick
In a very fashionable hovel
I hang around dying to be tortured
Youll never be alone in the bone orchard
This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel
So in this almostempty gin palace
Through a twoway looking glass you see your Alice
You know she has no sins for all your jealousy
In a sense she still smiles very sweetly
Charged with insults and flattery
Her body moves with malice
Do you have to be so cruel to be callous
And now you find you fit this identikit completely
You say you have no secrets then leave discreetly
I might make it Californias fault
Be locked in Genevas deepest vault
Just like the canals of Mars and the Great Barrier Reef
I come to you beyond belief
My hands were clammy and cunning
Shes been suitably stunning
But I know theres not a hope in Hades
All the laddies catcall and wolfwhistle
Socalled gentlemen and ladies dogfight like rose and thistle
Ive got a feeling
Im going to get a lot of grief
Once this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief
Ive got a feeling
Im going to get a lot of grief
Once this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief
Ive got a feeling
Im going to get a lot of grief
Once this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief
Ive got a feeling
Im going to get a lot of grief
