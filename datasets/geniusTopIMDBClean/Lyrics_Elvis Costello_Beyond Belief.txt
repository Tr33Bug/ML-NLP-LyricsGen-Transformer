Beyond Belief Lyrics
History repeats the old conceits
The glib replies, the same defeats
Keep your finger on important issues
With crocodile tears and a pocketful of tissues
I'm just the oily slick
On the wind-up world of the nervous tick
In a very fashionable hovel
I hang around, dying to be tortured
You'll never be alone in the bone orchard
This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel
So in this almost-empty gin palace
Through a two-way looking glass, you see your Alice
You know she has no sins for all your jealousy
In a sense, she still smiles very sweetly
Charged with insults and flattery
Her body moves with malice
Do you have to be so cruel to be callous?
And now, you find you fit this identikit completely
You say you have no secrets, then leave discreetly
I might make it California's fault
Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault
Just like the canals of Mars and the Great Barrier Reef
I come to you beyond belief

My hands were clammy and cunning
She's been suitably stunning
But I know there's not a hope in Hades
All the laddies catcall and wolf-whistle
So-called gentlemen and ladies dogfight like rose and thistle

I've got a feeling
I'm going to get a lot of grief
Once, this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief
I've got a feeling
I'm going to get a lot of grief
Once, this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief
I've got a feeling
I'm going to get a lot of grief
Once, this seemed so appealing
Now I am beyond belief
I've got a feeling
I'm going to get a lot of grief...You might also like1Embed
