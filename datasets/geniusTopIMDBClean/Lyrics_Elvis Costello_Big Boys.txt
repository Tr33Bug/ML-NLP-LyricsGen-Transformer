I am starting to function
In the usual way
Everything is so provocative
Very very temporary
I shall walk
Out of this place
I shall walk out on you
Cause you go silly if shes willing
Trying so hard to be like the big boys
So you take her to the pictures
Trying to become a fixture
Inch by inch trying to reach her
All the way through the second feature
Worrying about your physical fitness
Tell me how you got this sickness
I was caught in the suction
By a face like a truncheon
I was down upon one knee
Stroking her vanity
I was stuck on a hammerhead
I came alive and left for dead
As my face returned to red
Choking on my pride and pity
We can talk  we can talk 
Until your face is blue  til your face is blue 
We can talk but shell get to you
After youve been loved and hated
By the ones youve watched and waited
Found that they were overrated
Shell be the one  when the partys over
Shell be the one  when the girls have gone home
Shell be the one  that youll wish youd held onto
Shell be the one  but its too late for you to
Shell be the one  who knows all your history
Shell be the one  so you can cross her off your list
And you try so hard
And you try so hard
And you try so hard to be like the big boys
