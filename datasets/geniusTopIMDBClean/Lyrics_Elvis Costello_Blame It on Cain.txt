Once upon a time I had a little money
Government burglars took it
Long before I could mail it to you
Still you are the only one
Now I cant let it slip away
So if the man with the ticker tape
He tries to take it
Well this is what Im going to say
Blame it on Cain
Dont blame it on me
Oh oh oh its nobodys fault
But we need somebody to burn
Well if I was a saint with a silver cup
And the money got low
We could always heat it up
Or trade it in
But then the radio to heaven will be wired to your purse
And then you can run down the wave band
Coast to coast hand in hand
Bad to worse curse for curse
Dont be dissatisfied
So youre not satisfied
Blame it on Cain
Dont blame it on me
Oh oh oh its nobodys fault
But we need somebody to burn
I think Ive lived a little too long
On the outskirts of town
I think Im going insane
From talking to myself for so long
Oh but Ive never been accused
But when they step up on your face
You wear that goodluck grin
I got to break out one weekend
Fore I do somebody in
But every single time
I feel a little stronger
They tell me its a crime
Well how much longer


Blame it on Cain
Dont blame it on me
Oh oh oh its nobodys fault
But we need somebody to burn
Blame it on Cain
Oh oh oh please dont blame it on me
Its nobodys fault
But it just seems to be his turn
