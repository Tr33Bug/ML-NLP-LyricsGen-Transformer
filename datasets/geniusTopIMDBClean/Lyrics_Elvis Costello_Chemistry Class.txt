She throws back her hair and she shows you her mouth
The breath that I waste trying to ruin your life
Beautys on a budget but you take it on the chin
Cause you have to do your duty taking orders from the kingpin
Youve got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind
You dont know what you started when you mixed it up with mine
Are you ready for the final solution
Oh oh
Chopped you up in butchers school
Threw you out of the academy of garbage
Youll be a joker all your life
A student at the comedy college
Peoplepleasing people pleasing people like you
Youve been around so long but you still dont know what to do
Youve got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind
You dont know what you started when you mixed it up with mine
Are you ready for the final solution
Oh oh
Sparks are flying from electrical pylons
Snakes and ladders running up and down her nylons
Ready to experiment youre ready to be burned
If it wasnt for some accidents then some would never ever learn
Youve got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind
You dont know what you started when you mixed it up with mine
Are you ready for the final solution
Yeah
Oh
