With a handful of backhanders and a bevy of beauty
Youre going off limits
Going off duty
Going off the rails
Going off with booty
They tell tales of fiction found on all the criminal types
Lead to a higher ranking man or a face with thin red stripes
The boys next door
The mums and dads
New weds and nearlydeads
Have you ever been had in Clubland
In Clubland
Theres a piece in someones pocket to do the dirty work
Youve come to shoot the pony
Theyve come to do the jerk
They leave him half way to paradise
They leave you half way to bliss
The ladies invitation never seemed like this
The boys next door
The mums and dads
New weds and nearlydeads
Have you ever been had in Clubland
In Clubland
The long arm of the law slides up the outskirts of town
Meanwhile in Clubland they are ready to pull them down
Hey
The right to work is traded in for the right to refuse admission
Dont pass out now theres no refund
Did you find out what you were missing
The crowd is taking forty winks minus ten percent
You barely get required sleep to go lingering with contentment
Thursday to Saturday moneys gone already
Some things come in common these days
Your hands and work arent steady
The boys next door
The mums and dads
New weds and nearlydeads
Have you ever been had in Clubland
In Clubland
In Clubland
In Clubland
