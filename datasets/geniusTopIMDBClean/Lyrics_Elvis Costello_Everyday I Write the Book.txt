Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah
Ooh ooh
Dont tell me you dont know what love is
When youre old enough to know better
When you find strange hands in your sweater
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote
Im a man with a mission in two or three editions
And Im giving you a longing look
Everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday
Everyday I write the book
Chapter one we didnt really get along
Chapter two I think I fell in love with you
You said youd stand by me in the middle of chapter three
But you were up to your old tricks in chapters four five and six
And Im giving you a longing look
Everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday
Everyday I write the book
The way you walk the way you talk and try to kiss me
And laugh in four or five paragraphs
All your compliments and your cutting remarks
Are captured here in my quotation marks  oohhoo 
Im giving you a longing look
Everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday
Everyday I write the book
Everyday I write the book


Dont tell me you dont know the difference
Between a lover and a fighter
With my pen and my electric typewriter
Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal
Id still own the film rights and be working on the sequel
And Im giving you a longing look
Everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday  everyday
Everyday I write the book
Everyday  everyday  everyday
Everyday I write the book
Everyday  everyday  everyday
Everyday I write the book ooh
Yeah
Everyday everyday everyday 
Everyday I write the book 
Im giving you a longing look  Everyday everyday 
Everyday everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book 
Im giving you a longing look  Everyday everyday 
Everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book 
Im giving you a longing look  Everyday everyday 
Everyday everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book 
Im giving you a longing look  Everyday everyday 
Everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book 
Im giving you a longing look  Everyday everyday 
Everyday everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book 
Im giving you a longing look  Everyday everyday 
Everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book 
Im giving you a longing look  Everyday everyday 
Everyday everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book 
Everyday everyday everyday  Everyday everyday 
Everyday everyday  Everyday I write the book 
Everyday everyday  Im giving you a longing look 
Everyday everyday 
Everyday everyday I write the book  Everyday I write the book
