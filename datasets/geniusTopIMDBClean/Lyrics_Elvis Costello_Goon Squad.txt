Mother Father Im here in the zoo
I cant come home cause Ive grown up too soon
I got my sentence I got my command
They said theyd make me major if I met all their demands
I could be a corporal into corporal punishment
Or the general manager of a large establishment
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod
But I never thought theyd put me in the
Goon squad
Theyve come to look you over and theyre giving you the eye
Goon squad
They want you to come out to play youd better say goodbye
Some grow up just like their dads and some grow up too tall
Some go drinking with the lads some dont grow up at all
You must find the proper place for everything you see
But youll never get to make a lampshade out of me
I could join a chain of males or be the missing link
Looking for a lucky girl to put me in the pink
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod
But I never thought theyd put me in the
Goon squad
Theyve come to look you over and theyre giving you the eye
Goon squad
They want you to come out to play youd better say goodbye
Mother Father Im doing so well
Im making such progress now that you can hardly tell
I fit in a little dedication with one eye on the clock
They caught you under medication you could be in for a shock
Thinking up the alibis that everyones forgotten
Just another Mummys boy gone to rotten
They pat some good boys on the back and put some to the rod
But I never thought theyd put me in the
Goon squad
Theyve come to look you over and theyre giving you the eye
Goon squad
They want you to come out to play youd better say goodbye
