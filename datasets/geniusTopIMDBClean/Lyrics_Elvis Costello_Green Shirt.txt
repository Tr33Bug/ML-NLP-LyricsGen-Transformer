Theres a smart young woman on a light blue screen
Who comes into my house every night
She takes all the red yellow orange and green
And she turns them into black and white
But you tease and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it
Better cut off all identifying labels
Before they put you on the torture table
Cause somewhere in the Quisling Clinic
Theres a shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes
Shes listening in to the Venus line
Shes picking out names
I hope none of them are mine
But you tease and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it
Never said I was a stool pigeon
I never said I was a diplomat
Everybody is under suspicion
But you dont wanna hear about that
Cause you tease and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it
Better send a begging letter to the big investigation
Who put these fingerprints on my imagination
You tease and you flirt
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it
