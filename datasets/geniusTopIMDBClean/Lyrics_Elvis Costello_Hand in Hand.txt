Hand in hand
No dont ask me to apologize
I wont ask you to forgive me
If Im going to go down
Youre going to come with me
You say Why dont you be a man about it
Like they do in the grownup movies
But when it comes to the other way around
You say you just want to use me oh
You sit and you wonder whether
Its going to be syndicated
You sit with your knees together
All the time your breath is bated
Hand in hand
No dont ask me to apologize
I wont ask you to forgive me
If Im going to go down
Youre going to come with me
Dont you know I got the bully boys out
Changing someones facial design
Sitting with my toy room lout
Polishing my precious china
Dont you know Im an animal
But dont you know I cant stand up steady
But you cant show me any kind of hell
That I dont know already
Hand in hand
No dont ask me to apologize
I wont ask you to forgive me
If Im going to go down
Youre going to come with me
Hand in hand
Hand in hand
Hand in hand
Hand in hand hand in hand
Hand in hand hand in hand
Hand in hand hand in hand
Hand in hand hand in hand
Hand in hand hand in hand
Hand in hand hand in hand
