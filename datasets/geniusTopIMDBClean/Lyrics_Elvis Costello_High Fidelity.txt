Some things you never get used to
Even though youre feeling like another man
Theres nothing that he can do for you
To shut me away as you walk through
Lovers laughing in their amateur hour
Holding hands in the corridors of power
Even though Im with somebody else right now
High fidelity
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
High fidelity
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Theres a new kind of dedication
Maybe youll find it down the tunnel
Maybe I got above my station
Maybe youre only changing channel
Even though youre nowhere near me
And I know you kiss him so sincerely now
Even though the signals indistinct
And you worry what silly people think
Who just cant wait to feel so frozen out
Bet he thinks that he was chosen out of the millions
I suppose youll never know about
High fidelity
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
High fidelity
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
