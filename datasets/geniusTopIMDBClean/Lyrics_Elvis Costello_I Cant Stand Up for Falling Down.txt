Im the living result
Im a man whos been hurt a little too much
Now Ive tasted the bitterness of my own tears
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel
I cant stand up for falling down
I cant stand up for falling down
Simple though love is
Still it confused me
Why Im not loved the way I should be
Now Ive lived with heartaches
And Ive roomed with fear
Ive dealt with despair
And Ive wrestled with tears
I cant stand up for falling down
I cant stand up for falling down
The vow that we made
You broke it in two
But that dont stop me from loving you
I cant stand up for falling down
I cant stand up for falling down
