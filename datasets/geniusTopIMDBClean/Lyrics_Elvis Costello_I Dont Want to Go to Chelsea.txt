I Dont Want to Go to  Chelsea Lyrics
Photographs of fancy tricks
To get your kicks at sixtysix
He thinks of all the lips that he licks
And all the girls that hes going to fix
She gave a little flirt gave herself a little cuddle
But theres no place here for the miniskirt waddle
Capital punishment shes last years model
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie
I dont want to go to Chelsea
Oh no it does not move me
Even though Ive seen the movie
I dont want to check your pulse
I dont want nobody else
I dont want to go to Chelsea
Everybodys got new orders
Be a nice girl and kiss the warders
Now the teacher is away
All the kids begin to play
Men come screaming dressed in white coats
Shake you very gently by the throat
Ones named Gus ones named Alfie
I dont want to go to Chelsea
Oh no it does not move me
Even though Ive seen the movie
I dont want to check your pulse
I dont want nobody else
I dont want to go to Chelsea


Photographs of fancy tricks
To get your kicks at sixtysix
He thinks of all the lips that he licks
And all the girls that hes agoing to fix
She gave a little flirt gave herself a little cuddle
But theres no place here for the miniskirt waddle
Capital punishment shes last years model
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie
I dont want to go to Chelsea
Oh no it does not move me
Even though Ive seen the movie
I dont want to check your pulse
I dont want nobody else
I dont want to go to Chelsea
