What do you get when you fall in love
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
Thats what you get for all your trouble
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
What do you get when you kiss a girl
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do shell never phone you
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
Dont tell me what its all about
Cause Ive been there and Im glad Im out
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why Im here to remind you
What do you get when you give your heart
You get it all broken up and battered
Thats what you get a heart thats shattered
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why Im here to remind you
What do you get when you fall in love
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
