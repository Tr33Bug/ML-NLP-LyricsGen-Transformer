Iâ€™m Not Angry Lyrics
You're upstairs with the boyfriend while I'm left here to listen
I hear you calling his name; I hear the stutter of ignition
I could hear you whispering as I crept by your door
So you found some other joker who could please you more

I'm not angry
I'm not angry anymore
I'm not angry
I'm not angry anymore
Ooh, I know what you're doing
I know where you've been
I know where, but I don't care
'Cause there's a-no such thing as an original sin

I've got this camera click, click, clicking in my head
I got you talking with your hands, got you smiling with your legs
Spent all my time in a vanity factory
Wondering when they're going to come and take it all back

I'm not angry
I'm not angry anymore
I'm not angry
I'm not angry anymore

Ooh, I know what you're doing
I know where you've been
I know where, but I don't care
'Cause there's a-no such thing as an original sin
Oh, there's a-no such thing as an original sin
Oh, there's a-no such thing as an original sin
You might also like
I'm not angry (anymore)
