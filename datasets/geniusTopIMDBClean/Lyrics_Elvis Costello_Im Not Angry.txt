Youre upstairs with the boyfriend while Im left here to listen
I hear you calling his name I hear the stutter of ignition
I could hear you whispering as I crept by your door
So you found some other joker who could please you more
Im not angry
Im not angry anymore
Im not angry
Im not angry anymore
Ooh I know what youre doing
I know where youve been
I know where but I dont care
Cause theres ano such thing as an original sin
Ive got this camera click click clicking in my head
I got you talking with your hands got you smiling with your legs
Spent all my time in a vanity factory
Wondering when theyre going to come and take it all back
Im not angry
Im not angry anymore
Im not angry
Im not angry anymore
Ooh I know what youre doing
I know where youve been
I know where but I dont care
Cause theres ano such thing as an original sin
Oh theres ano such thing as an original sin
Oh theres ano such thing as an original sin


Im not angry  anymore
