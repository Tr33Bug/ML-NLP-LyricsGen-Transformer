Calling Mister Oswald with the swastika tattoo
There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo
Carving V for vandal on the guilty boys head
When hes had enough of that maybe youll take him to bed
To teach him hes alive fore he wishes he was dead
Turn up the TV no one listening will suspect
Even your mother wont detect it
So your father wont know
They think that Ive got no respect
But everything means less than zero
Hey red
Hey red
Oswald and his sister are doing it again
Theyve got the finest home movies that you have ever seen
Theyve got a thousand variations every service with a smile
Theyre going to take a little break and theyll be back after a while
Well I hear that South America is coming into style
Turn up the TV no one listening will suspect
Even your mother wont detect it
So your father wont know
They think that Ive got no respect
But everything means less than zero
Hey red
Hey red
A pistol was still smoking a man lay on the floor
Mister Oswald said he had an understanding with the law
He said he heard about a couple living in the USA
He said they traded in their baby for a Chevrolet
Lets talk about the future now weve put the past away
Turn up the TV no one listening will suspect
Even your mother wont detect it
So your father wont know
They think that Ive got no respect but
Everything means less than zero
Hey red
Hey red
Hey red
Hey red
Hey hey
Hey red
Hey red
Hey red
Hey
