You left the motor running
But I know youre so attractive
Getting in some sharp practice
You better not do anything reckless
But everybody is going through the motions
Everybody is going through the motions
Are you really only going through the motions
Lip service is all youll ever get from me
Lip service is all youll ever get from me
Lip service is all youll ever get from me
But if you change your mind you can send it in a letter to me
Dont make any sudden movements
These are dangerous amusements
When did you become so choosy
Dont act like youre above me just look at your shoes
If everybody is going through the motions
Everybody is going through the motions
Are you really only going through the motions
Lip service is all youll ever get from me
Lip service is all youll ever get from me
Lip service is all youll ever get from me
But if you change your mind you can send it in a letter to me
But if you change your mind you can send it in a letter to me
But if you change your mind you can send it in a letter to me
