Dont say you love me when its just a rumor
Dont say a word if there is any doubt
Sometimes I think that love is just a tumor
Youve got to cut it out
You say youre sorry for the things that you have done
You say youre sorry but you know you dont mean it
I wouldnt worry I had so much fun
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being
Its you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
Its you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
Oh yeah
Get to the slot machine almost dead on arrival
Just hit me one more time with that live wire
Maybe they told you you were only a girl in a million
You say Ive got no feelings
This is a good way to kill them
Select the control and then insert the token
You wanna throw me away but Im not broken
Youve got a lot to say well Im not joking
There are some words they dont allow to be spoken
Sometimes I almost feel just like a human being
Its you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
Its you
Not just another mouth in the lipstick vogue
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogue
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogue
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogue
Not just another mouth lost in the lipstick vogue
