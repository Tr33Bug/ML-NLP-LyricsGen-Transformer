Little triggers that you pull with your tongue
Little triggers
I dont want to be hung up strung up
When you dont call up
Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers my hand on your hip
Thinking all about those censored sequences
Worrying about the consequences
Waiting until I come to my senses
Better put it all in present tenses
Little triggers that you pull with your tongue
Little triggers
I dont want to be hung up strung up
When you dont call up
Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers my hand on your hip
Worrying about the common decency
When it is only a question of frequency
When you say OK but I got to cheek to be
Saying youre tired of me when you dont even weaken these
Little triggers that you pull with your tongue
Little triggers
I dont want to be hung up strung up
When you dont call up
Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers my hand on your hip
