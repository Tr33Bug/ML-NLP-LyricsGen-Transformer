Little Triggers Lyrics
Little triggers that you pull with your tongue
Little triggers
I don't want to be hung up, strung up
When you don't call up
Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers, my hand on your hip

Thinking all about those censored sequences
Worrying about the consequences
Waiting until I come to my senses
Better put it all in present tenses
Little triggers that you pull with your tongue
Little triggers
I don't want to be hung up, strung up
When you don't call up
Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers, my hand on your hip

Worrying about the common decency
When it is only a question of frequency
When you say OK but I got to cheek to be
Saying you're tired of me when you don't even weaken these

Little triggers that you pull with your tongue
Little triggers
I don't want to be hung up, strung up
When you don't call up
Little sniggers on your lips
Little triggers in your grip
Little triggers, my hand on your hipYou might also likeEmbed
