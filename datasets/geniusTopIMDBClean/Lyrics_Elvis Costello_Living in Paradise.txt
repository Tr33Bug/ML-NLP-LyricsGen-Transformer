I dont like those other guys looking at your curves
I dont like you walking round with physical jerks
Everything they say and do is getting on my nerves
Soon they will be lucky to be picking up the perks
Cause when they pull the shutters down
And throw up in the dark
Theyll find that all the dogs outside
Bite much worse than they bark
Here we are living in paradise  Paradise 
Living in luxury
Oh the thrill is here but it wont last long
Youd better have your fun before it moves along
And youre already looking for another fool like me
I call you Betty Felon cause you are a pretty villain
And I think that I should tell em
That youd make a pretty killing
Cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate
Saying Wed always knew youd make it
Didnt think youd come this late
And now its much too dangerous to stop what youve begun
When everyone in paradise carries a gun
Here we are living in paradise  Paradise 
Living in luxury
Oh the thrill is here but it wont last long
Youd better have your fun before it moves along
And youre already looking for another fool like me
Later in the evening when arrangements are made
Ill be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door
Cause Im the first to know whenever the plans are laid
That never go further than floor to floor
You think that I dont know the boy that youre touching
But Ill be at the video and I will be watching
Here we are living in paradise  Paradise 
Here we are living in paradise  Paradise 
Here we are living in paradise  Paradise 
Here we are living in paradise  Paradise 
Living in luxury
Oh the thrill is here but it wont last long
Youd better have your fun before it moves along
And youre already looking for another fool like me
And youre already looking for another fool like me
And youre already looking for another fool like me
And youre already looking for another fool like me
And youre already looking for another fool
