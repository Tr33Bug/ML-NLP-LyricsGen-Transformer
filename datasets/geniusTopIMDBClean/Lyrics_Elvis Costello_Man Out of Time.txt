So this is where he came to hide
When he ran from you
In a private detectives overcoat
And dirty dead mans shoes
The pretty things of Knightsbridge
Lying for a minister of state
Is a far cry from the nod and wink
Here at traitors gate
Because the high heel he used to be has been ground down
And he listens for the footsteps that would follow him around
To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time
Theres a tuppeny hapenny millionaire
Looking for a fourpenny one
With a tight grip on the short hairs
Of the public imagination
But for his private wife and kids somehow
Real life becomes a rumor
Days of Dutch courage
Just three French letters and a German sense of humor
Hes got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge
He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege
To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time
The biggest wheels of industry
Retire sharp and short
And the after dinner overtures
Are nothing but an after thought
Somebodys creeping in the kitchen
Theres a reputation to be made
Whose nerves are always on a knifes edge
Whos up late polishing the blade
Love is always scarpering or cowering or fawning
You drink yourself insensitive and hate yourself in the morning
To murder my love is a crime
But will you still love a man out of time
Will you still love a man out of time
Will you still love a man out of time
