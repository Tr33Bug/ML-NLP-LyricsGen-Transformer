You never asked me what I wanted
You only asked me why
I never thought that so much trouble
Was resting on my reply
I could say it was the nights when I was lonely
And you were the only one whod come
I could tell you that I like your sensitivity
When you know its the way that you walk
Why do you have to say that theres always someone
Who can do it better than I can
But dont you think that I know that walking on the water
Wont make me a miracle man
Babys got to have the things she wants
You know shes got to have the things she loves
Shes got a teninch bamboo cigarette holder
And her black patent leather gloves
And Im doing everything just trying to please her
Even crawling around on all fours
Oh I thought by now that it was gonna be easy
But she still seems to want for more
Why do you have to say that theres always someone
Who can do it better than I can
But dont you think that I know that walking on the water
Wont make me a miracle man
Oh yeah
Never given you a bad reputation
Just because youve never been denied
You try to say youve done it all before
Baby you know that you just get tired
Yet everybody loves you so much girl
I just dont know how you stand the strain
Oh I Im the one whos here tonight
And I dont want to do it all in vain
Why do you have to say that theres always someone
Who can do it better than I can
But dont you think that I know that walking on the water
Wont make me a miracle man
Oh yeah
A miracle man  8x
