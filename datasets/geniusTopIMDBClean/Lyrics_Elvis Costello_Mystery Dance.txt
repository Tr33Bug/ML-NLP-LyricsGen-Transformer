Romeo was restless he was ready to kill
He jumped out the window cause he couldnt sit still
Juliet was waiting with a safety net
He said Dont bury me cause Im not dead yet
Why dont you tell me bout the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why dont you show me
Cause Ive tried and Ive tried
And Im still mystified
I cant do it anymore and Im not satisfied
Well I remember when the lights went out
And I was trying to make it look like it was never in doubt
She thought that I knew and I thought that she knew
So both of us were willing but we didnt know how to do it
Why dont you tell me bout the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why dont you show me
Cause Ive tried and Ive tried
And Im still mystified
I cant do it anymore and Im not satisfied
Well I was down under the covers in the middle of the night
Trying to discover my left foot from my right
You can see those pictures in any magazine
But whats the use of looking when you dont know what they mean
Why dont you tell me bout the mystery dance
I want to know about the mystery dance
Why dont you show me
Cause Ive tried and Ive tried
And Im still mystified
I cant do it anymore and Im not satisfied
I cant do it anymore and Im not satisfied
