I would send out for assistance but theres someone on the signal wire
And the corporation logo is flashing on and off in the sky
Theyre putting all your names in the forbidden book
I know what theyre doing but I dont want to look
You think theyre so dumb you think theyre so funny
Wait until theyve got you running to the
Night rally night rally
Night rally
Everybodys singing with their hand on their heart
About deeds done in the darkest hours
Thats just the sort of catchy little melody
To get you singing in the showers
Oh I know that Im ungrateful
Ive got it lying on a plate
And Im not buying my share of souvenirs
You can stand to attention
You can pray to your uncle
Only get that chicken out of here
Everyone gets armbands and 3D glasses
Some are in the back room
And theyre taking those night classes
You think theyre so dumb you think theyre so funny
Wait until theyve got you running to the
Night rally night rally
Night rally night rally
Night rally night rally
Night rally night rally
Night rally night rally
Night rally night rally
Night rally night rally
Night rally night rally
