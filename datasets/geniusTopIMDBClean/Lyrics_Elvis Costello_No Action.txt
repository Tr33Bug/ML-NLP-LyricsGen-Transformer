I dont wanna kiss you I dont wanna touch
I dont wanna see you cause I dont miss you that much
Im not a telephone junkie
I told you that we were just good friends
But when I hold you like I hold that Bakelite in my hands
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Every time I phone you I just wanna put you down
Hes got the keys to the car
They are the keys to the kingdom
Hes got everything you need
Its a shame that he didnt bring them
Im not a telephone junkie
If Im inserting my coin Im doing just fine
Then the things in my head start hurting my mind
And I think about the way things used to be
Knowing youre with him is driving me crazy
Sometimes I phone you when I know youre not lonely
But I always disconnect it in time
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Every time I phone you I just wanna put you
Every time I phone you I just wanna put you
Every time I phone you I just wanna put you down
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Theres no action  no no no theres no action 
Every time I phone you I just wanna put you down
