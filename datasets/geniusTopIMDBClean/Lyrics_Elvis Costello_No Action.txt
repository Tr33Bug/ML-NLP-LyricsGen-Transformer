No Action Lyrics
I don't wanna kiss you, I don't wanna touch
I don't wanna see you 'cause I don't miss you that much
I'm not a telephone junkie
I told you that we were just good friends
But when I hold you like I hold that Bakelite in my hands

There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
Every time I phone you, I just wanna put you down
He's got the keys to the car
They are the keys to the kingdom
He's got everything you need
It's a shame that he didn't bring them
I'm not a telephone junkie
If I'm inserting my coin, I'm doing just fine
Then the things in my head start hurting my mind
And I think about the way things used to be
Knowing you're with him is driving me crazy
Sometimes, I phone you when I know you're not lonely
But I always disconnect it in time

There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
Every time I phone you, I just wanna put you
Every time I phone you, I just wanna put you
Every time I phone you, I just wanna put you down
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
There's no action (no, no, no, there's no action)
Every time I phone you, I just wanna put you downYou might also like2Embed
