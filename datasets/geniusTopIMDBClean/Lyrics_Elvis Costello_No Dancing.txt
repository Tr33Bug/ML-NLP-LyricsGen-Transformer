I know that she has made a fool of him
Like girls have done so many nights before time and time again
Life is so strange I dont know why
But somebody somebody has to cry
Theres gonna be no dancing when they get home
Theres gonna be no dancing
Theres gonna be no dancing
Theres gonna be no dancing when they get home
Now hes telling her every little thing hes done
Once he glanced at the jackets of some paperbacks now hes read every one
Hes such a drag hes not insane
Its just that everybody has to feel his pain
Theres gonna be no dancing when they get home
Hes getting down on his knees
He finds that the girl is not so easy to please
Oh oh after all his nights were just a paper striptease
Shes caught it like some disease
If he says No dancing theres gonna be no dancing
Theres gonna be no dancing on my own
She cant even speak to him he cant face her now
He says Even though I want to shake your hand all I ever do is bow
So now you see how it can be
Why cant you give me anything but sympathy
Theres gonna be no dancing
Theres gonna be no dancing
Theres gonna be no dancing
Theres gonna be no dancing
Theres gonna be no dancing on my own
