Dont start that talking
I could talk all night
My mind goes sleepwalking
While Im putting the world to right
Call careers information
Have you got yourself an occupation
Olivers army is here to stay
Olivers army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
There was a Checkpoint Charlie
He didnt crack a smile
But its no laughing party
When youve been on the murder mile
Only takes one itchy trigger
One more widow one less white nigga
Olivers army is here to stay
Olivers army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
Hong Kong is up for grabs
London is full of Arabs
We could be in Palestine
Overrun by the Chinese line
With the boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne
But theres no danger
Its a professional career
Though it could be arranged
With just a word in Mister Churchills ear
If youre out of luck or out of work
We could send you to Johannesburg


Olivers army is here to stay
Olivers army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today
