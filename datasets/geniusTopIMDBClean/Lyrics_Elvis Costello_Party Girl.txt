Party Girl Lyrics
They say you're nothing but a party girl
Just like a million more all over the world
I know I shouldn't be raising my hopes so high
But I have seen the hungry look in their eyes
They'd settle for anything in disguise of love
Seen the party girls look me over
Seen 'em leaving when the party's over

They can't touch me now
You say you don't mind
We're so hard to find
I could give you anything but time
Give it just one more try
Give it a chance
Starts like fascination
Ends up like a trance

Oh, you'll never be the guilty party, girl
Maybe someday, we can go hiding from this world
Maybe I'll never get over the change in style
But I don't wanna lock you up and say you're mine
Don't wanna lose you or say goodbye
I'm the guilty party, and I want my slice
But I know you've got me, and I'm in a grip-like vise

They can't touch me now
You say you don't mind
We're so hard to find
I could give you anything
I would give you anything
I can give you anything but (time)

Give you anything but (time)...
