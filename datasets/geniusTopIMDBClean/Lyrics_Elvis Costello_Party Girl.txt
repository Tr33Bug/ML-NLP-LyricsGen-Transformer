They say youre nothing but a party girl
Just like a million more all over the world
I know I shouldnt be raising my hopes so high
But I have seen the hungry look in their eyes
Theyd settle for anything in disguise of love
Seen the party girls look me over
Seen em leaving when the partys over
They cant touch me now
You say you dont mind
Were so hard to find
I could give you anything but time
Give it just one more try
Give it a chance
Starts like fascination
Ends up like a trance
Oh youll never be the guilty party girl
Maybe someday we can go hiding from this world
Maybe Ill never get over the change in style
But I dont wanna lock you up and say youre mine
Dont wanna lose you or say goodbye
Im the guilty party and I want my slice
But I know youve got me and Im in a griplike vise
They cant touch me now
You say you dont mind
Were so hard to find
I could give you anything
I would give you anything
I can give you anything but  time 
Give you anything but  time
