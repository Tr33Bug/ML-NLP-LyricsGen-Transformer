Ive been on tenterhooks ending in dirty looks
Listening to the Muzak thinking bout this n that
She said thats that I dont wanna chitterchat
Turn it down a little bit or turn it down flat
Pump it up when you dont really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it
Down in the pleasure center hellbent or heaven sent
Listen to the propaganda listen to the latest slander
Theres nothing underhand that she wouldnt understand
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you dont really need it
Hey
Shes been a bad girl shes like a chemical
Though you try to stop it shes like a narcotic
You wanna torture her you wanna talk to her
All the things you bought for her could not get a temperature
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you dont really need it
Out in the fashion show down in the bargain bin
You put your passion out under the pressure pin
Fall into submission hitandrun transmission
No use wishing now for any other sin
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you dont really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you dont really need it
Pump it up until you can feel it
Pump it up when you dont really need it
Dont really need it
Dont really need it
Dont really need it
