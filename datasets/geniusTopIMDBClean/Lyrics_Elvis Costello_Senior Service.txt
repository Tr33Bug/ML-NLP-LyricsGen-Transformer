Senior service junior dissatisfaction
Its a breath you took too late
Its a death thats worse than fate
Senior service junior dissatisfaction
Though it may be secondhand
Its by no means secondrate
I want your neck I want the seat that you sit at
I want your check because they told me I would get on
I wanna chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket
If you should drop dead tonight then they wont have to ask me twice

The way that I could benefit from death and disability

I want your company car I want your girlfriend and love
I want your place at the bar because theres always another man
To chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket
If you should drop dead tonight then they wont have to ask me twice
