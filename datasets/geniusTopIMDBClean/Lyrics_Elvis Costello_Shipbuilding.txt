Is it worth it
A new winter coat and shoes for the wife
And a bicycle on the boys birthday
Its just a rumor that was spread around town
By the women and children
Soon well be shipbuilding
Well I ask you
The boy said Dad theyre going to take me to task
But Ill be back by Christmas
Its just a rumor that was spread around town
Somebody said that someone got filled in
For saying that people get killed in
The result of this shipbuilding
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls
Its just a rumor that was spread around town
A telegram or a picture postcard
Within weeks theyll be reopening the shipyard
And notifying the next of kin
Once again
Its all were skilled in
We will be shipbuilding
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls
Its all were skilled in
We will be shipbuilding
With all the will in the world
Diving for dear life
When we could be diving for pearls
When we could be diving for pearls
When we could be diving for pearls
