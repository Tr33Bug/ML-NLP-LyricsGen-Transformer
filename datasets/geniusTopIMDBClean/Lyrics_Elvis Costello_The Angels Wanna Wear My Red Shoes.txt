The Angels Wanna Wear My  Red Shoes Lyrics
Oh I used to be disgusted
And now I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know the angels want to wear my red shoes
But when they told me bout their side of the bargain
Thats when I knew that I could not refuse
And I wont get any older now the angels want to wear my red shoes
Oh oh I was watching while youre dancing away
Our love got fractured in the echo and sway
How come everybody wants to be your friend
You know that it still hurts me just to say it
Oh I know that shes disgusted  Oh whys that 
Because shes feeling so abused  Oh thats too bad 
She gets tired of the lust  Oh Im so sad 
But its so hard to refuse
Can you say that Im too old
When the angels have stolen my red shoes
Oh I said Im so happy I could die
She said Drop dead then left with another guy
Thats what you get if you go chasing after vengeance
Ever since you got me punctured this has been my sentence
Oh I used to be disgusted
Well now I try to be amused
But since their wings have got rusted
You know the angels want to wear my red shoes
But when they told me bout their side of the bargain
Thats when I knew that I could not refuse
And I wont get any older now the angels want to wear my red shoes
Oh I wont get any older now the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes the angels want to wear my red shoes
Red shoes the angels want to wear my red shoes
