Were all going on a summer holiday
Vigilantes coming out to follow me
Heard somebody say theyre out to collar me
Anybody want to swallow me
It takes two to tumble it takes two to tango
Speak up dont mumble if youre in the combo
On the beat  On the beat 
On the beat  On the beat 
Til the man comes along and says
Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ
See your friends in the state theyre in
See your friends getting under their skin
See your friends getting taken in
Well if you only knew the things you do to me
Id do anything to confuse the enemy
Theres only one thing wrong with you befriendin me
Take it easy I think youre bendin me
Ive been a bad boy with the standard leader
My neighbors revving up his Vauxhall Viva
On the beat  On the beat 
On the upbeat  On the beat 
Til the man comes along and he says
Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ
See your friends walking down the street
See your friends never quite complete
See your friends getting under their feet
Oh I dont want to disease you
But Im no good with machinery
Oh I dont want to freeze you
Stop looking at the scenery
I keep thinking about your mother
Oh I dont want to lick them
I dont want to be a lover
I just want to be your victim
I dont go out much at night
I dont go out much at all
Did you think you were the only one
Who was waiting for a call
On the beat  on the beat 
On the beat  on the beat 
On the upbeat  on the beat 
Til the man comes along and he says
Have you been a good boy
Never played with your toy
Though you never enjoy
Such a pleasure to employ
See your friends treat me like a stranger
See your friends despite all the arrangements
See your friends nothing here has changed
Just the beat  just the beat 
Just the beat  just the beat 
Just the beat  just the beat 
Just the beat
