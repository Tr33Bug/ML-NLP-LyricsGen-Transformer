See her picture in a thousand places
Cause shes this years girl
You think you all own little pieces
Of this years girl
Forget your fancy manners
Forget your English grammar
Cause you dont really give a damn about this years girl
Still youre hoping that shes well spoken
Cause shes this years girl
You want her broken with her mouth wide open
Cause shes this years girl
Never knowing its a real attraction
All these promises of satisfaction
While shes being bored to distraction
Being this years girl
Times running out
Shes not happy with the cost
Thered be no doubt
Only shes forgotten much more than shes lost
A bright spark might corner the market
In this years girl
You see yourself rolling on the carpet
With this years girl
Those disco synthesizers
Those daily tranquilizers
Those body building prizes
Those bedroom alibis
All this but no surprises for this years girl
All this but no surprises for this years girl
All this but no surprises for this years girl
