I saw a newspaper picture
From the political campaign
A woman was kissing a child
Who was obviously in pain
She spills with compassion
As that young childs face in her hands she grips
Can you imagine all that greed
And avarice coming down on that childs lips
Well I hope I dont die too soon
I pray the Lord my soul to save
Yes Ill be a good boy
Im trying so hard to behave
Because theres one thing I know
Id like to live long enough to savour
Thats when they finally put you in the ground
Ill stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down
When England was the whore of the world
Margaret was her madam
And the future looked as bright and as clear
As the black tarmacadam
Well I hope that she sleeps well at night
Isnt haunted by every tiny detail
When she held that lovely face in her hands
All she thought of was betrayal
And now the cynical ones
Say that it all ends the same in the long run
Try telling that to the desperate father
Who just squeezed the life from his only son
And how its only voices in your head
And dreams youve never dreamt
Try telling him the subtle difference
Between justice and contempt
Try telling me she isnt angry
With this pitiful discontent
When they flaunt it in your face
As you line up for punishment
And then expect you to say Thank you
Straighten up look proud and pleased
Because youve only got the symptoms
You havent got the whole disease
Just like a schoolboy whose heads like a tincan
Filled up with dreams then poured down the drain
Try telling that to the boys on both sides
Being blown to bits or beaten and maimed
Who takes all the glory and none of the shame


Well I hope you live long now
I pray the Lord your soul to keep
I think Ill be going before
We fold our arms and start to weep
I never thought for a moment
That human life could be so cheap
But when they finally put you in the ground
Theyll stand there laughing and tramp the dirt down
