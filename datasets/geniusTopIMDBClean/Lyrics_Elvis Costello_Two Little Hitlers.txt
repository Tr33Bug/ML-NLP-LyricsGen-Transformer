Why are we racing to be so old
Im up late pacing the floor I wont be told
You have your reservations Im bought and sold
Ill face the music Ill face the facts
Even when we walk in polka dots and checker slacks
Bowing and squatting running after tidbits
Bobbing and squinting just like a nitwit
Two little Hitlers will fight it out until
One little Hitler does the other ones will
I will return
I will not burn
Down in the basement
I need my head examined I need my eyes excited
Id like to join the party but I was not invited
You make a member of me Ill be delighted
I wouldnt cry for lost souls you might drown
Dirty words for dirty minds written in a toilet town
Dial me a valentine shes a smooth operator
Its all so calculated shes got a calculator
Shes my soft touch typewriter and Im the great dictator
Two little Hitlers will fight it out until
One little Hitler does the other ones will
I will return
I will not burn
A simple game of selfrespect
You flick the switch and the world goes out
Nobody jumps as you expect
I would have thought you would have had enough by now


You call selective dating for some effective mating
I thought Id let you down dear but you were just deflated
I knew right from the start wed end up hating
Pictures of the merchandise plastered on the wall
We can look so long as we dont have to talk at all
You say youll never know him hes not a natural man
He doesnt want your pleasure he wants as no one can
He wants to know the names of all those hes better than
Two little Hitlers will fight it out until
One little Hitler does the other ones will
I will return
I will not burn
I will return
I will not burn
I will return
I will not burn
