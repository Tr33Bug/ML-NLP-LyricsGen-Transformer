Is it all in that pretty little head of yours
What goes on in that place in the dark
Well I used to know a girl and I could have sworn
That her name was Veronica
Well she used to have a carefree mind of her own
And a delicate look in her eye
These days Im afraid shes not even sure
If her name is Veronica
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica Veronica
Did the days drag by Did the favors wane
Did he roam down the town all the while
Will you wake from your dream with a wolf at the door
Reaching out for Veronica
Well it was all of sixtyfive years ago
When the world was the street where she lived
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica
On the Empress of India
And as she closed her eyes upon the world
And picked upon the bones of last weeks news
She spoke his name out loud again
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica Veronica


Veronica sits in her favorite chair
She sits very quiet and still
And they call her a name that they never get right
And if they dont then nobody else will
But she used to have a carefree mind of her own
With devilish look in her eye
Saying You can call me anything you like
But my name is Veronica
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica Veronica
Oh Veronica
