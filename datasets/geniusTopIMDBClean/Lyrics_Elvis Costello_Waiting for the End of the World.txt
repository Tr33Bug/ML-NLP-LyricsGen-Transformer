The man from the television crawled into the train
I wonder who hes going to stick it in this time
Everyone was looking for a little entertainment
So theyll probably pull his hands off
When they find out his name
And then they shut down the power all along the line
And we got stuck in the tunnel where no lights shine
They got to touching all the girls who were too scared to call out
Nobody was saying anything at all
We were waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Dear Lord I sincerely hope youre coming
Cause you really started something
Things got back to normal as the train began to roll again
We got to the station about twenty minutes later
The legendary hitchhiker says that he knows where its at
Now hed like to go to Spain or somewhere like that
With his twotone Bible and his funny cigarettes
His suntan lotion and his castanets
He was waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Waiting for the end of the world
Dear Lord I sincerely hope youre coming
Cause you really started something
And then the bride the groom the congregation and the priest
All got onto the train when we were three stations east yeah
Hiding from a scandal in the national press
They had been trying to get married since they stole the wedding dress
You may see them drowning as you stroll along the beach
But dont roll out the lifeline till theyre clean out of reach
Waiting for the end of the world
