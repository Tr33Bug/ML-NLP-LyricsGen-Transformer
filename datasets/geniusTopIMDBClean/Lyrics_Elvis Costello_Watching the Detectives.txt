Nice girls not one with a defect
Cellophane shrinkwrapped so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs
She looks so good that he gets down and begs
She is watching the detectives
Ooh hes so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot shoot shoot shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he cant be wounded cause hes got no heart
Long shot at that jumping sign
Invisible shivers running down my spine
Cut to baby taking off her clothes
Closeup of the sign that says We never close
He snatched at you and you match his cigarette
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
I dont know how much more of this I can take
Shes filing her nails while theyre dragging the lake
She is watching the detectives
Ooh hes so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot shoot shoot shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he cant be wounded cause hes got no heart
You think youre alone until you realize youre in it
Now fear is here to stay love is here for a visit
They call it instant justice when its past the legal limit
Someones scratching at the window I wonder who is it
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
Who are ready to hear the worst
About their daughters disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away
Just like watching the detectives
Dont get cute its just like watching the detectives
I get so angry when the teardrops start
But he cant be wounded cause hes got no heart
Watching the detectives
Its just like watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
Watching the detectives
