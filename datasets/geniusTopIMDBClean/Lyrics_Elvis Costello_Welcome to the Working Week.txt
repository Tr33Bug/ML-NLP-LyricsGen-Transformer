Now that your pictures in the paper being rhythmically admired
And you can have anyone that you have ever desired
All you got to tell me now is why why why why
Welcome to the working week
Oh I know it dont thrill you I hope it dont kill you
Welcome to the working week
You got to do it till youre through it and so you better get to it
All of your family had to kill to survive
And theyre still waiting for their big day to arrive
But if they knew how I felt theyd bury me alive
Welcome to the working week
Oh I know it dont thrill you I hope it dont kill you
Welcome to the working week
You got to do it till youre through it so you better get to it
I hear you saying Hey the citys alright
When you only read about it in books
Spend all your money getting so convinced
That you never even bother to look
Sometimes I wonder if were living in the same land
Whyd you want to be my friend
When I feel like a juggler running out of hands
Welcome to the working week
Oh ah welcome to the working week
