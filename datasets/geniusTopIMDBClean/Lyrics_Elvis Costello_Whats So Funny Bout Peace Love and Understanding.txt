(What’s So Funny ’Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding Lyrics
As I walk through this wicked world
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself, is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred and misery?

And each time I feel like this inside
There's one thing I wanna know
What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
And as I walked on through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong?
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me want to cry
What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?


So where are the strong?
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me want to cry
What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?
Oh, what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?You might also like1Embed
