Whats So Funny Bout  Peace Love and Understanding Lyrics
As I walk through this wicked world
Searching for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself is all hope lost
Is there only pain and hatred and misery
And each time I feel like this inside
Theres one thing I wanna know
Whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
Oh whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
And as I walked on through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted
And where is the harmony
Sweet harmony
Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me want to cry
Whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
Oh whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted
And where is the harmony
Sweet harmony
Cause each time I feel it slipping away
Just makes me want to cry
Whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
Oh whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
Oh whats so funny bout peace love and understanding
