What are you girls going to tell your mother
I dont want to hear another word about young lovers
Or hiding your boyfriend in the cupboard
Shes been to see the doctor so you hope that she recovers
You act dumb
You say youre so numb
You say you dont come under his thumb
Dont want to be a goodygoody
I dont want just anybody
No I dont want anybody
Saying You belong to me you belong to me
Your eyes are absent your mouth is silent
Pumping like a fire hydrant
Things you see are getting hard to swallow
Youre easily led but youre much too scared to follow
Youve been warned
Youre going to get torn
No uniform is going to keep you warm
Dont want to be a goodygoody
I dont want just anybody
No I dont want anybody
Saying You belong to me you belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You you belong to me
You you belong to me
You belong to me
