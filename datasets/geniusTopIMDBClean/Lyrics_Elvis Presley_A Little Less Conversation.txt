A little less conversation a little more action please
All this aggravation aint satisfactionin me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music
Drifting through a summer breeze
Its a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease
Hey a little less conversation a little more action please
All this aggravation aint satisfactionin me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  Satisfy me 
Satisfy me baby  Satisfy me 
Come on baby Im tired of talking
Grab your coat and lets start walking
Come on come on  Come on come on 
Come on come on  Come on come on 
Come on come on  Come on come on 
Dont procrastinate dont articulate
Girl its getting late gettin upset waitin around
A little less conversation a little more action please
All this aggravation aint satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me  Satisfy me 
Satisfy me baby  Satisfy me 
Satisfy me girl  Come on come on come on come on 
Satisfy me baby  Satisfy me 
Satisfy me  Come on come on come on come on 
Satisfy me baby  Satisfy me

Satisfy me baby  Come on come on come on come on 
Satisfy me  Satisfy me
