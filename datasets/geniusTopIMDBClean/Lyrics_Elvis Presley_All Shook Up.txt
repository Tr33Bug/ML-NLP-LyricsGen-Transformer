Uh well abless my soul whats wrong with me
Im itchin like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say Im actin wild as a bug
Im in love Im all shook up
Mm ooh yeah yeah
Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I cant seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck
Im in love Im all shook up
Mm ooh yeah yeah
Well please dont ask me whats on my mind
Im a little mixed up but I feel fine
When Im near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death
When she touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano thats hot
Im proud to say that shes my buttercup
Im in love Im all shook up
Mm ooh yeah yeah
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
Theres only one cure for this body of mine
Thats to have that girl that I love so fine
She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano thats hot
Im proud to say that shes my buttercup
Im in love Im all shook up
Mm ooh yeah yeah
Mm ooh yeah yeah
Im all shook up
