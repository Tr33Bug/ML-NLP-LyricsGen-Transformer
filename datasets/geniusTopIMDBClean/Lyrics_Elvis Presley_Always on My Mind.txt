Maybe I didnt treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didnt love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didnt hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
Im so happy that youre mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl Im so sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasnt died
Give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didnt treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didnt love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didnt hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
Im so happy that youre mine
Maybe I didnt treat you
Quite as good as I should have
