Oh Amazing grace oh how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now Im found
Was blind but now I see
When weve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
Weve no less days to sing Gods praise
Then when when we first begun
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
Tis Grace has brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
Amazing grace oh how sweet the sound
To save a wretch like me
I once was lost but now Im found
Was blind but now I see
Was blind but now I see
