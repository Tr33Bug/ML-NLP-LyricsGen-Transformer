Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away look away look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
Because Dixieland thats where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away look away look away Dixieland
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
So hush little baby
Dont you cry
You know your daddys bound to die
But all my trials Lord will soon be over
Glory glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
