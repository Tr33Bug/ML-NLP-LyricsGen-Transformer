Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Thats when those blue memories start callin
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Youll be doin all right with your Christmas of white
Ahh ahh 
But Ill have a blue blue blue blue Christmas
Ooh ah ooh 
Ooh ah ooh 
Youll be doin all right with your Christmas of white
Ahh ahh 
But Ill have a blue blue blue blue Christmas
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
