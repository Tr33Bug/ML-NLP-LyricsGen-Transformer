Blue moon blue moon blue moon
Keep shining bright
Blue moon keep on shining bright
Youre gonna bring me back my baby tonight
Blue moon keep shining bright
I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one thats gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one thats gone and left me blue
Well it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one thats gone and left me blue
Well I said blue moon of Kentucky just keep on shining
Shine on the one thats gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one thats gone and left me blue
Well it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one thats gone and left me blue
