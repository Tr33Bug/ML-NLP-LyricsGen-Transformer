Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
Without a love of my own
