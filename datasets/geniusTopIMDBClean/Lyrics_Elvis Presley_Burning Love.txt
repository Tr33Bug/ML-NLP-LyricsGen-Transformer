Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
Its burning through to my soul
Girl girl girl girl
Youre gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I dont know which way to go
Your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
Ooh ooh ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Help me Im flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning burning burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love
Its coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Wont you help me
I feel like Im slipping away
Its hard to breathe
And my chest is aheaving
Lord have mercy
Im burning a hole where I lay
Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
Ah ah burning love 
Im just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
