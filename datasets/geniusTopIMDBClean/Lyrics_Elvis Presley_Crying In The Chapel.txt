You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now Im happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that Ill grow stronger
As I live from day to day
Ive searched  Ive searched  and Ive searched  Ive searched 
But I couldnt find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind
Now Im happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord  One accord 
Yes we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
Youll search  Youll search  and youll search  Youll search 
But youll never find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray  Knees and pray 
Then your burdens will be lighter
And youll surely find the way  And youll surely find the way
