You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you cant come around
At least please telephone
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
Baby if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please lets forget my past
The future looks bright ahead
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
I dont want no other love
Baby its just you Im thinkin of
Dont stop thinking of me
Dont make me feel this way
Cmon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
Why should we be apart
I really love you baby cross my heart
Lets walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then youll know youll have me
And Ill know that Ill have you
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
I dont want no other love
Baby its just you Im thinkin of
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
Dont be cruel to a heart thats true
I dont want no other love
Baby its just you Im thinkin of
