Well a hard headed woman
A soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began
Oh yeah  oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Now Adam told to Eve
Listen here to me
Dont you let me catch you
Messing round that apple tree
Oh yeah  oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Oh yeah  oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Samson told Delilah
Loud and clear
Keep your cotton picking fingers
Out my curly hair
Oh yeah  oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man


I heard about a king
Who was doin swell
Till he started playing
With that evil Jezebel
Oh yeah  oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
I got a woman
A head like a rock
If she ever went away
Id cry around the clock
Oh yeah  oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
