Well since my baby left me
Well I found a new place to dwell
Well its down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel
Where Ill be Ill be so lonely baby
Well Im so lonely
Ill be so lonely I could die
Although its always crowded
You still can find some room
For brokenhearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom
Theyll be theyll be so lonely baby
Theyll be so lonely
Theyre so lonely they could die
Now the bellhops tears keep flowin
And the desk clerks dressed in black
Well theyve been so long on Lonely Street
Theyll never never look back
And they get so they get so lonely baby
Well they are so lonely
Theyre so lonely they could die
Well now if your baby leaves you
And you got a tale to tell
Well just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel


Where you will be you will be youll be so lonely baby
Well you will be lonely
Youll be so lonely you could die
Although its always crowded
You still can find some room
For brokenhearted lovers
To cry there in their gloom
Where they get so they get so lonely baby
Well theyre so lonely
Theyll be so lonely they could die
