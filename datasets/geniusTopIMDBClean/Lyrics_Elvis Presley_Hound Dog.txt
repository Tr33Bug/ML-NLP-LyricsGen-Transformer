You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
Well you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine
When they said you was high classed
Well that was just a lie
Yeah they said you was high classed
Well that was just a lie
Yeah you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine
You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
Well you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine
Ahh ahh
Ahh ahh
When they said you was high classed
Well that was just a lie
Yeah they said you was high classed
Well that was just a lie
Well you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine
Ahh ahh

When they said you was high classed
Well that was just a lie
You know they said you was high classed
Well that was just a lie
Yeah you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine


You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
Well you aint never caught a rabbit
You aint no friend of mine
