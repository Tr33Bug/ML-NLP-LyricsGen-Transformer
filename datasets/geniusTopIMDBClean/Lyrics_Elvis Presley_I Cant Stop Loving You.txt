I cant stop loving you
I said  Ive made up my mind yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone lonely time
And I cant stop wanting you
I said Its useless to say yes I did
So Ill just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue
They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since weve been apart
I cant stop loving you
So Ive made up my mind yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone lonely time
And I cant stop wanting you
I said its useless to say yes I did
So Ill just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
