Laughter 
I just cant help believin
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty mornin
And a promise of tomorrow in her eyes
I just cant help believin
When shes lying close beside me
And my heart beats
With the rhythm of her sighs
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
Well I just cant help believin
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just cant help believin
When shes whispering her magic
And her tears are shining
Honeysweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay  This time the girl is gonna stay 
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
Ahahhah
Ahahhah
Ahahhah
Ahhahh
For more than just a day
Oh I just cant help believin 
Sing the song baby
Oh I just cant help believin 
One more time
Oh I just cant help believin 
And one more
Oh I just cant help believin 
For more than just a day
Oh I just cant help believin
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just cant help believin
When she smiles and whisper her magic
And her tears are shining
Honeysweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay  This time the girl is gonna stay 
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
Oh I just cant help believin 
Take it
Oh I just cant help believin 
Yo
Oh I just cant help believin 
Oh I just cant help believin
