There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why oh why oh why cant my dream come true Oh why
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why oh why oh why wont that sun appear
Were lost in a cloud with too much rain
Were trapped in a world thats troubled with pain
But as long as a man has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly  He can fly 
Deep in my heart theres a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answers answers gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark theres a beckoning candle yeah
And while I can think while I can talk while I can stand while I can walk
While I can dream oh please let my dream come true oh right now
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah
