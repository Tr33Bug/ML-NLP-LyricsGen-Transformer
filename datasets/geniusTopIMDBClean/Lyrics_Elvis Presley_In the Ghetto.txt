As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto  In the ghetto 
And his mama cries
Cause if theres one thing that she dont need
Its another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto  In the ghetto 
People dont you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or hell grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto  In the ghetto 
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto  In the ghetto 
Then one night in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun he steals a car
Tries to run but he dont get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers round an angry young man
Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto  In the ghetto 
And as her young man dies  In the ghetto 
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto  In the ghetto 
And his mama cries
In the ghetto  In the ghetto 
In the ghetto
