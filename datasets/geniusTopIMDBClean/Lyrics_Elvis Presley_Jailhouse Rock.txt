The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Lets rock everybody lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joey blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash boom bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang
Lets rock everybody lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Number fortyseven said to number three
You the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me
Lets rock everybody lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Rock rock rock
Sad Sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said Hey buddy dont you be no square
You cant find a partner use a wooden chair
Lets rock everybody lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Shifty Henry said to Bugs For Heavens sake
No ones looking nows our chance to make a break
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks
Lets rock everybody lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
