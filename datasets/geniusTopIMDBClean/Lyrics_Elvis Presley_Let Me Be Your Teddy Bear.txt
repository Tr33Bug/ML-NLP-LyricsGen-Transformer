Let Me Be Your  Teddy Bear Lyrics
Baby let me be your loving teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be  oh let him be 
Your teddy bear
I dont wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I dont wanna be a lion
Cause lions aint the kind you love enough
Just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be  oh let him be 
Your teddy bear
Baby let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
Oh let me be  oh let him be 
Your teddy bear
I dont wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I dont wanna be a lion
Cause lions aint the kind you love enough
Just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh let me be  oh let him be 
Your teddy bear

Oh let me be  oh let him be 
Your teddy bear
I just wanna be your teddy bear  whoo
