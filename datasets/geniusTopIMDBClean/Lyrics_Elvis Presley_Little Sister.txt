Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you kiss me once or twice
Then say its very nice
And then you run
Little sister dont you do what your big sister done
Well I dated your big sister
And I took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out the door
Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you kiss me once or twice
Then say its very nice
And then you run
Little sister dont you do what your big sister done
Every time I see your sister
Well shes got somebody new
Shes mean and shes evil
Like that little ol boll weevil
Guess Ill try my luck with you
Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you kiss me once or twice
Then say its very nice
And then you run
Little sister dont you do what your big sister done
Well I used to pull your pigtails
And pinch your turnedup nose
But you been agrowing
And baby its been showing
From your head down to your toes


Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you
Little sister dont you kiss me once or twice
Then say its very nice
And then you run
Little sister dont you do what your big sister done
Little sister dont you do what your big sister done
Little sister dont you do what your big sister done
