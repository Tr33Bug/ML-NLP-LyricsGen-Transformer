Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel but love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart but love me  wont you love me 
Well if you ever go
Darling Ill be oh so lonely
Ill be sad and blue
Crying over you dear only
I would beg and steal  beg and steal 
Just to feel  just to feel 
Your heart  I want your heart 
Beating close to mine  so close to mine 
Well if you ever go
Darling Ill be oh so lonely
Ill be sad and blue
Crying over you dear only  ooh 
I would beg and steal  he would beg and steal 
Just to feel  yes just to feel 
Your heart  I want your heart 
Beating close to mine  so close to mine 
Well if you ever go
Darling Ill be oh so lonely
Beggin on my knees
All I ask is please please love me
Oh yeah
