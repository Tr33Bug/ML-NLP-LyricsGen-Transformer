I will spend my whole life through
Loving you just loving you
Winter summer springtime too
Loving you loving you
Makes no difference where I go or what I do
You know that Ill always be loving you
Just you and
If Im seen with someone new
Dont be blue dont you be blue
Ill be faithful Ill be true
Always true true to you
There is only one for me and you know who
You know that Ill always be loving you
