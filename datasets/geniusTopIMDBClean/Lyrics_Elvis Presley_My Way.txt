And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend Ill say it clear
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
Ive traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh and more much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times Im sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
Ive loved Ive laughed and cried
Ive had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no no not me
I did it my way


For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
