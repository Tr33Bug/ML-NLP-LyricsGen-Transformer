I gave a letter to the postman
He put it in his sack
Bright and early next morning
He brought my letter back
She wrote upon it 
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone
We had a quarrel
A lovers spat
I write Im sorry
But my letter keeps coming back
So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
Bright and early next morning
It came right back to me
She wrote upon it 
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such person
No such zone
This time Im gonna take it myself
And put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day
Then Ill understand
The writing on it 
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone
