Well get out of that bed wash your face and hands
Get out of that bed wash your face and hands
Well get in that kitchen make some noise with the pots and pans
I believe it to my soul youre the devil in nylon hose
I believe it to my soul youre the devil in nylon hose
For the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well I said shake rattle and roll

Well you wont do right to save your doggone soul
