Were caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why cant you see what youre doin to me
When you dont believe a word I say
We cant go on together
With suspicious minds  With suspicious minds 
And we cant build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So if an old friend I know stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes
Here we go again asking where Ive been
You cant see the tears are real Im cryin  Yes Im cryin 
We cant go on together
With suspicious minds  With suspicious minds 
And we cant build our dreams
On suspicious minds
Oh let our love survive
Ill dry the tears from your eyes
Lets dont let a good thing die
When honey you know Ive never lied to you
Mmm yeah yeah
Were caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why cant you see what youre doin to me
When you dont believe a word I say
Well dont you know Im caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well dont you know Im caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well dont you know Im caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well dont you know Im caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well dont you know Im caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well dont you know Im caught in a trap I cant walk out
Because I love you too much baby
