TranslationsPortuguÃªsSuspicious Minds Lyrics
We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (With suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So if an old friend I know stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again, asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm cryin' (Yes, I'm cryin')

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (With suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Oh, let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When, honey, you know I've never lied to you
Mmm, yeah, yeah

We're caught in a trap, I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see what you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap? I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, babyYou might also like16Embed
