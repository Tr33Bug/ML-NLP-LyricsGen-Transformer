Thatâ€™s All Right Lyrics
Well, that's all right, mama
That's all right for you
That's all right mama, just anyway you do
Well, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

Well Mama, she done told me
Papa done told me too
Son, that girl you're fooling with
She ain't no good for you
But, that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

I'm leaving town, baby
I'm leaving town for sure
Well, then you won't be bothered with
Me hanging around your door
But that's all right, that's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you do

Ah da da dee dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee
I need your lovin'
That's all right
That's all right now mama, anyway you doYou might also likeEmbed
