If youre looking for trouble
You came to the right place
If youre looking for trouble
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a greeneyed mountain jack
Because Im evil
My middle name is misery
Well Im evil
So dont you mess around with me
Ive never looked for trouble
But Ive never ran
I dont take no orders
From no kind of man
Im only made out
Of flesh blood and bone
But if youre gonna start a rumble
Dont you try it on alone
Because Im evil
My middle name is misery
Well Im evil
So dont you mess around with me
Im evil evil evil as can be
Im evil evil evil as can be
So dont mess around dont mess around dont mess around with me
Im evil Im evil
Evil evil
So dont mess around dont mess around with me
Im evil I tell you Im evil
So dont mess around with me
Yeah
