Ive been travelling over mountains
Even through the valleys too
Ive been travelling night and day
Ive been running all the way
Baby trying to get to you
Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
Ive been travelling night and day
Ive been running all the way
Baby trying to get to you
When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didnt mean a thing
I just had to reach you baby
In spite of all that Ive been through
I kept travelling night and day
I kept running all the way
Baby trying to get to you
Well if I had to do it over
Thats exactly what Id do
I would travel night and day
And Id still run all the way
Baby trying to get to you
Well theres nothing that could hold me
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true
Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through
When my way was dark as night
He would shine His brightest light
When I was trying to get to you
