Oh my love my darling
Ive hungered
For your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry wait for me wait for me
Ill be coming home wait for me
My love my darling
Ive hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
I need your love I need your love
God speed your love to me
