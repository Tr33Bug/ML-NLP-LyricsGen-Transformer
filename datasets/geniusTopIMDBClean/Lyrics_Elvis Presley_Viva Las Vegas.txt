Bright light city going to set my soul
Going to set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money thats ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
Theres a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And theyre all living the devil may care
And Im just the devil with love to spare
Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the twentyfour hours in the day
Even if there were forty more
I wouldnt sleep a minute away
Oh theres black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you needs a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
Youll never be the same again
Im going to keep on the run
Im going to have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke oh well
Ill always remember that I had a swinging time
Im gonna give it everything Ive got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Viva Las Vegas
