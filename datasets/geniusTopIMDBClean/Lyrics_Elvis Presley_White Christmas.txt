Im dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow
Im dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your day be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
IIIm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days may your days may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
