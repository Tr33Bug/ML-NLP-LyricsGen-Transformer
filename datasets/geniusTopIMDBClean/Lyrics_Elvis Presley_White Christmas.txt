White Christmas Lyrics
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
"May your day be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"
I-I-I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be whiteYou might also like1Embed
