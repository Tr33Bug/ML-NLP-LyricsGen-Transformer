Why me Lord What have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures Ive known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do to deserve loving You
And the kindness Youve shown
Lord Heavenly Jesus Im wasted and
So help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus my souls in Your hands
Try me Lord if you think theres a way
I can ever repay all Ive taken from You
Maybe Lord I can show someone else
What Ive been through myself
On my way back to You
Lord Heavenly Jesus I praise Him
So help me Jesus I know what I am oh yes
Now that I know that I needed You so
Help me Jesus my souls in Your hands
Jesus my souls in Your hands
