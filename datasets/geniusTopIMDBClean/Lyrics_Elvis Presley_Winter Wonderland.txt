Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight were happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
Hell say are you married well so no man
You can do the job when youre in town
Later on well conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
Hell say are you married well so no man
You can do the job when youre in town
Later on well conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland


I said
Walking in a winter wonderland
