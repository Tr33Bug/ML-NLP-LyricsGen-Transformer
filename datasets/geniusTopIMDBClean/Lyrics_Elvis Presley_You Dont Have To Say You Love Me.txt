When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasnt me who changed but you
And now youve gone away
But dont you know that now youre gone
And Im left here on my own
Now I have to follow you
And beg you to come home
You dont have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You dont have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me
Believe me
I cant help but love you
But believe me Ill never tie you down
Left alone just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All thats left is loneliness
Theres nothing left to feel
You dont have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You dont have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me oh believe me
Oh you dont have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You dont have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me believe me oh believe me
