Youre The  Devil In Disguise Lyrics
You look like an angel  look like an angel 
Walk like an angel  Walk like an angel 
Talk like an angel but I got wise
Youre the devil in disguise oh yes you are
The devil in disguise mmmhmmmmm
You fooled me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me
Youre not the way you seemed
You look like an angel  look like an angel 
Walk like an angel  Walk like an angel 
Talk like an angel but I got wise
Youre the devil in disguise oh yes you are
The devil in disguise mmmhmmmmm
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me I didnt see
The devil in your eyes
You look like an angel  look like an angel 
Walk like an angel  Walk like an angel 
Talk like an angel but I got wise
Youre the devil in disguise oh yes you are
The devil in disguise mmmhmmmmm


Youre the devil in disguise oh yes you are
Youre the devil in disguise  Oh yes you are 
Youre the devil in disguise oh yes you are
Youre the devil in disguise  Oh yes you are 
The devil in disguise
