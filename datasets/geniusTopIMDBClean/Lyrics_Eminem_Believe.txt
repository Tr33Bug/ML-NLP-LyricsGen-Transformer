And I started from the bottom
Like a snowmangroundup
Like round chuck and still put hands on you
Stayin wound up is how I spend time  Get it 
Sucker free confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes  Yeah 
Nother day in the life  Uh 
Used to have to scrape to get by  Yeah 
Now my communitys gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi  Say hi 
Im givin em pounds Im upscale now
Guess it means Im way in the sky  Way in the sky 
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya
Adversity if at first you dont succeed
Put your temper to more use
Cause bein brokes a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show em why youre you
So close God its like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shittick tick tickno remorse pew
Screw it Im lit and that attitude I blew up on quick
Thats why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WICwick wick wickwith a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done nah bitch not quite
Spotlights back on got my faith wheres yours
Do you still believe in me
Didnt I give everything I had to give you to make you see
Ill never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out I will never let you live it down
Ill never quit do you still believe in me
Man I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me theyre just ink blots
I just fling em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice  Yeah 
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle fingers free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse studied his formula learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
Cause fourletter words are more better heard
The world forcefed a turd to me youre getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it but I just get so into it
I was there consolin you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door you walked over to it
Im the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin to me as theyre goin through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since Cleanin Out My Closet
When I was havin trouble with the snare
Im that unrealistic prayer answered
And Ima get you jacked up like youre tryna fix a flat uh
When you struggle with despair
That doublefisted bareknuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts Im cuppin I am your fuck it switch nothin can compare
Do you still believe in me
Didnt I give everything I had to give you to make you see
Ill never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out I will never let you live it down
Ill never quit do you still believe in me
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my batterys low Ima need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you Proof because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole homie Im callin on you
Cause I think Im slowly startin to lose faith in it so
Give me that inkling and mo
tivation to go Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are twofaced didnt show
Let heartbeats loop produce hate in my soul
Layin vocals two days in a row
True statement hate to go down this road
But theres only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
Cause all my dues paid but this booths takin its toll
But its never too late to start a new beginnin
That goes for you too so what the fuck you gon do
Use the tools youre given
Or youre gon use the cards youre dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with em
I used to play the loservictim
Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I havent ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs hourglasses
If time was on my side Id still have none to waste
Man in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
Its like Id run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once youve won the race
When that dual exhaust is coolin off
Cause you dont got nothin left to prove at all
Cause you done already hit em with the coup de grce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis that Blue Steel that true skill
When that wheels loose I wont lose will
Do you still believe
