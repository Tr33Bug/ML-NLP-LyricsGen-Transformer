The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren

Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym bitch
Kick your shoes off let your hair down
And go berserk  All night long
Grow your beard out just weird out
And go berserk  All night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
Cause its mayhem til the AM
So baby make just like KFed
And let yourself go let yourself go
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody  Go berserk 
Grab your vial yeah
Guess its just the way that Im dressed aint it
Khakis pressed Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it aint that aftershave
Or cologne that made em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint

And let yourself go let yourself go
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke

And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian Lamar oh

Far as hard drugs are though thats the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
