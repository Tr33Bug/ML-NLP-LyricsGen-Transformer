Wheres my snare
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against
I have I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin kid thats behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin
Tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin
Not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as Im breathin
Keep kickin ass in the morning and takin names in the evenin
Leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
Look at me now I bet youre prolly sick of me now
Aint you Mama Ima make you look so ridiculous now
Im sorry Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  One more time 
I said Im sorry Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  Ha 
I got some skeletons in my closet and I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Ima expose it Ill take you back to 73
Before I ever had a multiplatinumselling CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I dont on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldnt picture leavin her side
Even if I hated Kim Id grit my teeth and Id try
To make it work with her at least for Hailies sake I maybe made some mistakes
But Im only human but Im man enough to face em today
What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
Cause Ida killed em shit I woulda shot Kim and him both
Its my life Id like to welcome yall to The Eminem Show


Im sorry Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  One more time 
I said Im sorry Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  Uh 
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissin
But put yourself in my position just try to envision
Witnessin your mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin
Goin through public housing systems victim of Mnchausens Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasnt
Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it
Wasnt it the reason you made that CD for me Ma
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma
But guess what youre gettin older now and its cold when youre lonely
And Nathans growin up so quick hes gonna know that youre phony
And Hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful
But youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  Haha 
See what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
You selfish bitch I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me  Hehe 
Well guess what I am deaddead to you as can be
Im sorry Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet  One more time 
I said Im sorry Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight Im cleanin out my closet
