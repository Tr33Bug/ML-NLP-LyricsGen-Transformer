The mother did drugs hard liquor cigarettes and speed

It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Dont dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
Im a criminal an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you werent raised

My dick shrunk smaller but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
