A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That Im actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well shit if you believe that then Ill kill you
You know why Cause Im a criminal
Criminal Youre goddamn right
Im a criminal Yeah Im a criminal
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
Thatll stab you in the head whether youre a fag or lez
Or a homosex hermaph or a transavest

And a prostitute while my wifes sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher Fifth grade teacher

The mother did drugs hard liquor cigarettes and speed
The baby came out disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Dont dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
Im a criminal an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you werent raised
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than youd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word
My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now dont ignore me you wont avoid me

Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it aint happenin to him
Slim Shady Im as crazy as Em
