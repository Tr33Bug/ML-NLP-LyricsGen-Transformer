Hello darkness my old friend 
Here I am alone again
Cant get out of this hole Im in
Its like the walls are closin in
You cant help me no one can
I can feel these curtains closin
I go to open em
But something pulls em closed again
Hello darkness my old friend 
Feels like Im loathing in Las Vegas
Havent got the vaguest why Im so lost
But Id make you this small wager
If I bet you Ill be in tomorrows paper
Who would the odds favor
Hello darkness my old friend 
Im so much like my father you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin this room Valium then chase it with booze
One little taste itll do
Maybe Ill take it and snooze then tear up the stage in a few
Hello darkness my old friend 
Fuck the Colt 45 Ima need somethin stronger
If I pop any caps it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round Im gettin loaded  Haha

Hello darkness my old friend 
Now Im starin at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin venue from my window
Thats when you know youre schizo
Hello darkness my old friend 
Cause I keep peekin out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But its almost as though I dont hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait is this the whole crowd I thought this shit was sold out
Hello darkness my old friend 
But its only the opening act its early dont overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Dont wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
Cause thatd be totally wack
You cant murder a show nobodys at
Hello darkness my old friend 
But what if nobody shows Panic mode
Bout to snap and go motherfuckin wacko at any second
Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit cameras in all directions
Hello darkness my old friend 
The press is bout to go ape shit bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips I got ammo for all the hecklers
Im armed to the teeth another Valium fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
Im blackin out Im all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now its just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media Im goin all out this is war
Hello darkness my old friend 


And I dont wanna be alone in the darkness  Yeah 
I dont wanna be alone in the darkness
I dont wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
Hello darkness my old friend 
People start to show up time to start the show up
Its 1005 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And Im already sweatin but Im locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin for all the concertgoers
Scopes for sniper vision surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin out the window going Keyser Sze
Finger on the trigger but Im a licensed owner
With no prior convictions so law says skys the limit
So my supplys infinite strapped like Im a soldier
Got em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta staying alive by inches
Hello darkness my old friend 
Cops are knockin oh fuck thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note just a note for target distance
But if youd like to know the reason why I did this
Youll never find a motive truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped no signs of mental illness
Just tryin to show ya the reason why were so fucked
Cause by the time its over wont make the slightest difference
Hello darkness my old friend 
And I dont wanna be alone in the darkness
I dont wanna be alone in the darkness
I dont wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
