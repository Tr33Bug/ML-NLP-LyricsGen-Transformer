Feels like a close its coming to
Fuck am I gonna do
Its too late to start over
This is the only thing I thing I know
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called Hi My Name Is dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modernday Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
Gangster Nah courageous balls
Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldnt amount to a shit stain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging its your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme
What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to
I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out out out
Afraid Id never be found  My dreams 
I didnt wanna go another round  Yeah 
An angry mans power will shut you up  Agh 
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run  Yeah 
Guts over fear  The time is near 
Guts over fear  Might shed a tear 
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down  Now I got 
Guts over fear guts over fear
Feels like a close its coming to
Fuck am I gonna do
Its too late to start over
This is the only thing I thing I know
I know what it was like I was there once
Single parents hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park Oh
And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
But Id rather make Not Afraid 2
Than make another motherfucking We Made You ah
Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use thatll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you Ma cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shadymania so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything youre scared to say
Dont be afraid to say no more
From this day forward just let them aholes talk
Take it with a grain of saltand eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde
Lives on through you when Im gone and to think I was a
I was a afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out out out
Afraid Id never be found  My dreams 
I didnt wanna go another round  Yeah 
An angry mans power will shut you up  Agh 
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run  Yeah 
Guts over fear  The time is near 
Guts over fear  Might shed a tear 
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down  Now I got 
Guts over fear guts over fear1K
