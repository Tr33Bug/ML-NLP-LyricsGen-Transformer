Mom I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and Im fucked up
And Mom I know hes not around
But dont you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink yeah
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst never thinkin about who what I said hurt
In what verse my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did I take it too far
Cleanin Out My Closet and all them other songs
But regardless I dont hate you cause Ma
Youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree dont mean shit to me
Youre kickin me out Its fifteen degrees
And its Christmas Eve Little prick just leave
Ma let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each others goats
Why we always at each others throats
Especially when Dad he fucked us both
Were in the same fuckin boat
Youd think thatd make us close  Nope 
Further away it drove us but together headlights shine
And a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
Back to grandmas house its straight up the road
And I was the man of the house the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eightyearsold
And thats when I realized you were sick
And it wasnt fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though but
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But Im sorry Mama for Cleanin Out My Closet
At the time I was angry rightfully Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause now I know its not your fault and Im not makin jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time its on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medications takin over
And your mental states deterioratin slow
And Im way too old to cry this shit is painful though
But Ma I forgive you so does Nathan yo
All you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
Foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers
Oh what a tangled web we have cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
But Ida flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa kidnap em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin to get some hamburgers
Me her and Nate we introduced you hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And Im mad I didnt get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So Mom please accept this as a
Tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to
Get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to
Lay it fore Im dead the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt I guess were crashin
So if Im not dreamin I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar cause youre my mom
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life  Start over 
One without a cause  Clean slate 
So Im coming home tonight  Yeah 
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew cant wake me up
Well just know that Im alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh even if theres songs to sing
Well my children will carry me
Just know that Im alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So Ill never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that Im alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life
