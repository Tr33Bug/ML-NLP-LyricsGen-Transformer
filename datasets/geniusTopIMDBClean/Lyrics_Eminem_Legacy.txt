Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
Ill be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if its true
Ill say it all for you
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin
Why am I so differently wired Am I a martian
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Cause I dont belong in this world
Thats why Im scoffin at authority defiant often
Flyin off at the handle at my mom
No dad so I am noncompliant at home
At school Im just shy and awkward
And I dont need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin problems
Thinkin he can try and solve em
Im outside chalkin up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin
To myself either that or inside hidin off in
The corner somewhere quiet tryin not to
Be noticed cause Im cryin and sobbin
I had a bad day at school so I aint talkin
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin locker
Cause he said that I eyeballed him
And if you fall Ill get you there
Ill be your savior from  Yeah  all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words
Cause this is my legacy legacy yeah
This is my legacy legacy yeah
Theres no guarantee
Its not up to me we can only see
This is my legacy legacy legacy legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mindbogglin
Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit
Bothers me but not my father he said sayonara
Then split but I dont give a shit
Im fine long as theres batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side at least I aint walkin
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a tenspeed which Ive acquired parts that
I find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin to put up a fight Its nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes Ive been jottin
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like Thats right fights on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic in my conquest
Thats word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest


This is my legacy legacy yeah
This is my legacy legacy yeah
Theres no guarantee
Its not up to me we can only see
This is my legacy legacy legacy legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
Now I think the fact that Im differently wireds awesome
Cause if I wasnt I wouldnt be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemys words as strength
To try and draw from and get inspired off em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin giant sacks of lyin dog shit
Now you shut up bitch I am talkin
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin worship the ground on which I am walkin
Me against the world so what Im Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 016 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
Its the body bag game bitch Im supplyin coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss bunch of Brian Baldingers
Youre gon die a balllicker Ive been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You dont respect the legacy I leave behind yall can
Suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass
In a flyin saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin and I aint haltin
Til I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
Im me and Im the Fire Marshall and this is my
This is my legacy legacy yeah
This is my legacy legacy yeah
Theres no guarantee
Its not up to me we can only see
This is my legacy legacy legacy legacy
