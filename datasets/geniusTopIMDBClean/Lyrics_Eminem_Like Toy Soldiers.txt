Step by step heart to heart
Left right left we all fall down
Step by step heart to heart
Left right left we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers
Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I aint never supposed to show it
My crew aint supposed to know it
Even if it means goin toetotoe with a Benzino
It dont matter I never drag em in battles that I cant handle
Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy the shit went way beyond some JAYZ and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
This aint what Im in hiphop for its not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin I helped build
It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin 
And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
While hes all over TV downtalkin the man
Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
But still knowin the shit could pop off at any minute cause
Step by step heart to heart
Left right left we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
But now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
The shit gets escalatedit aint just words no more is it
Its a different ballgame you call names and you aint just rappin
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin
Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash him Mash on him let him have it
Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin
Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then
But Im so busy bein pissed off I dont stop to think
That weve just inherited 50s beef with Murder Inc
And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
We still have soldiers thats on the front line
Whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show em we love em back and let em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I aint tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
Im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
Off at the jaws well then I can cause frankly Im sick of talkin
Im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience
Cause
Step by step heart to heart
Left right left we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on
