Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I cant tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now theres a steel knife in my windpipe
I cant breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right its like Im in flight
High off her love drunk from her hate
Its like Im huffin paint and I love her the more I suffer I suffocate
And right before Im about to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin hates me and I love it  Wait
Where you going  Im leaving you  No you aint
Come back  Were runnin right back here we go again
Its so insane cause when its goin good its goin great
Im Superman with the wind at his back shes Lois Lane
But when its bad its awful I feel so ashamed
I snapped Whos that dude I dont even know his name
I laid hands on her Ill never stoop so low again
I guess I dont know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when youre with em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin yeah them chills used to get em
Now youre gettin fuckin sick of lookin at em
You swore youd never hit em never do nothin to hurt em
Now youre in each others face
Spewin venom in your words when you spit em
You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em
Throw em down pin em
So lost in the moments when youre in em
Its the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say youre best to go your separate ways
Guess that they dont know ya
Cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over
Its a different day sound like broken records playin over
But you promised her next time youll show restraint
You dont get another chance life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess thats why they call it window pane


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things did things that we didnt mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns same routine
But your tempers just as bad as mine is youre the same as me
When it comes to love youre just as blinded baby please
Come back it wasnt you baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems
Maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Dont you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
Next time Im pissed Ill aim my fist at the drywall
Next time There wont be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
Im tired of the games I just want her back I know Im a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin leave again Ima tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire just gonna
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
