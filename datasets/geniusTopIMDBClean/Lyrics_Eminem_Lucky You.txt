I got a couple of mansions
Still I dont have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids it dont actually matter
Theyre askin me What the fuck happened to hiphop
I said I dont have any answers
Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but Im back on these rappers  Yeah 
And actually comin from humble beginnings
Im somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say What a wonderful feeling
Were on the upswing like were punchin the ceiling
But nothin is feeling like anyone has any fuckin ability
To even stick to a subject its killin me
The inability to pen humility
Hatata batata why dont we make a bunch of
Fuckin songs about nothin and mumble em
Fuck it Im goin for the jugular
Shit is a circus you clowns that are comin up
Dont give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap  Yeah 
Lets recap way back MCs that  What 
Wreak havoc on tape decks  Woo 
ADATs where the G Raps and Kanes at
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin face tats syruped out like tree sap
I dont hate trap  Nah  and I dont wanna seem mad
But in fact  Yeah  where the old me at The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back I need that
But I think its inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though  Lil bitch 
And if I pay it attention Im probly makin it bigger
But youve been takin ya dicks and Im fuckin back ho  Get it 
On the brink any minute got me thinkin of finishin
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin the benefits
Im asleep at the wheel again as I begin to thinkin about an evil intent of another beat Ima kill again
Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or threehundred milligram
And I might as well cause Ima end up bein a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me Im not a fuckin record breaker  Yeah 
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made I never cater
Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA  Yeah 
But I roll til the wheels fall off Im working tirelessly ayy
Its the moment yall been waitin for like California
Wishin rain to pour in that drought yall
Been prayin for my downfall  Yeah 
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
