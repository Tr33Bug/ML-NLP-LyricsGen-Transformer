You know I just dont get it
Last year I was nobody this year Im selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe em somethin
The fuck you want from me tenmillion dollars
Get the fuck outta here
You see Im just Marshall Mathers  Marshall Mathers 
Im just a regular guy
I dont know why all the fuss about me  Fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me  Did was doubt me 
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me  Take shots at me 
Yo you might see me joggin you might see me walkin
You might see me walkin a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch wont quit barkin
Or leanin out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Bigs killers dressin ridiculous
Blue and red like I dont see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist poppin and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Startin shit like some twentysixyearold skinny Cartman  Goddamn it 
An antiBackstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instincts to kill NSYNC dont get me started
These fuckin brats cant sing and Britneys garbage
Whats this bitch retarded Give me back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin
Whatever happened to wilin out and being violent
Whatever happened to catchin a good oldfashioned passionate asswhoopin
And gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy girl groups make me sick
And I cant wait til I catch all you faggots in public
Ima love it  Hahaha 
Vanilla Ice dont like me  Uhuh  he said some shit in Vibe to spite me  Yo 
Then went and dyed his hair just like me  Haha 
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin I dont care just bite me  Nana 
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little fouryearold boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer  Hehe 
And call themselves clowns cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit when yall live twenty miles away  Fuckin punks 
And I dont wrestle Ill knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out  ahh 
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck  blaow
Look at yall runnin your mouth again
When you aint seen a fuckin mile road south of 10
And I dont need help from D12 to beat up two females
In makeup who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus You damn right slim anus
I dont get fucked in mine like you two little flamin faggots
Cause Im just Marshall Mathers  Marshall Mathers 
Im not a wrestler guy
Ill knock you out if you talk about me  You talk about me 
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me  Assholes doubt me 
And if you wanna run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me  Best shot at me 
Is it because you love me that yall expect so much of me
You little groupie bitch get off me go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop thats on top
Of this fucked up head that Ive got Ive gone pop
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks hes too big to do some shit with MC GetBizzy
My fuckin bitch moms suin for tenmillion
She must want a dollar for every pill Ive been stealin
Shit where the fuck you think I picked up the habit
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch Mrs Briggs or Ms Mathers
It doesnt matter  faggot
Talkin about I fabricated my past
Hes just aggravated I wont ejaculate in his ass  Ugh 
So tell me what the hell is a fella to do
For every million I make another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninetysome cousins  Hey its me 
A halfbrother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybodys so happy and proud
Im finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriends house  Hey 
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheapass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page flipped right fast
And what do I see A picture of my big white ass
Okay let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh here XXL XXL
Now your magazine shouldnt have so much trouble to sell
Aw fuck it Ill even buy a couple myself
Cause Im just Marshall Mathers  Marshall Mathers 
Im just a regular guy
I dont know why all the fuss about me  Fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me  Did was doubt me 
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me  Take shots at me 
Because Im just Marshall Mathers  Marshall Mathers 
Im just a regular guy
I dont know why all the fuss about me  Fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before
All they did was doubt me  Did was doubt me 
Now everybody wanna run their mouth
And try to take shots at me  Take shots at me
