Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
Whatd Daddy always tell you
Straighten up little soldier stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about
You got me
Hailie I know you miss your Mom and I know you miss your Dad
When Im gone but Im tryna give you the life that I never had
I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry
Cause youre scared I aint there Daddys witchu in your prayers
No more cryin wipe them tears Daddys here no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it we gon do it
LainieUncles crazy aint he Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Were all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze I know its confusin you
Daddys always on the move Mommas always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us I dont see us ever bein
Together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be but its just something
We have no control over and thats what destiny is
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and thisll all just be a dream
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommys not here right now and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise Mommas gon be alright
Heh its funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree
And said some of em were from me cause Daddy couldnt buy em
Ill never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause Daddy felt like a bumsee Daddy had a job but his job
Was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom and at the time
Every house that we lived in either kept gettin
Broken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your Mom
Was savin money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurts so bad it broke your Mommas heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin a lot so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat onebedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And thats when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein Daddy on the TV and Momma didnt like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now Im sittin in this empty house just reminiscin
Lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
Wow guess you pretty much are and Daddys still here
Lainie Im talkin to you too Daddys still here
I like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it
Shh Mommas only gone for the moment
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommys not here right now and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But I promise mommas gon be alright
And if you ask me to Daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
Ima give you the world Ima buy a diamond ring for you
Ima sing for you Ill do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
Ima break that birdies neck
Ill go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat
Dont fuck with Dad  Haha
