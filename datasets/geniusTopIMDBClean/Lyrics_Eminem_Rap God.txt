Look I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But Im only going to get this one chance  Six minutes six minutes 
Somethings wrong I can feel it  Six minutes Slim Shady youre on 
Just a feeling Ive got like somethings about to happen but I dont know what 
If that means what I think it means were in trouble big trouble 
And if he is as bananas as you say Im not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My penll go off when I halfcock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin and a killin off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin on his nutsack
Im an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables skillaholic  Kill em all with 
This flippity dippityhippity hiphop
You dont really wanna get into a pissin match
With this rappity brat packin a MAC in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that
Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad
Its actually disastrously bad for the wack
While Im masterfully constructing this masterpice
Cause Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
Let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like  have got


Well to be truthful the blueprints
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since  Pew 
MCs get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me Im a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz 2Pac NWA Cube hey Doc Ren
Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
To meet RunDMC and induct them
Into the motherfuckin Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though Ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame Ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin
Little gaylookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy  Haha 
Youre witnessin a massoccur
Like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy
Oy vey that boys gaythats all they say lookin boy
You get a thumbs up pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day lookin boy
Hey lookin boy What you say lookin boy
I get a hell yeah from Dre lookin boy
Ima work for everything I have never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face lookin boy
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable
Of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause
Im beginnin to feel like a Rap God Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod back nod
The way Im racin around the track call me NASCAR NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planets Kryptonno Asgard Asgard
So youll be Thor and Ill be Odin
You rodent Im omnipotent
Let off then Im reloadin
Immediately with these bombs Im totin
And I should not be woken
Im the walkin dead but Im just a talkin head a zombie floatin
But I got your mom deepthroatin
Im out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin in common poodle
Im a Doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
Its me my honestys brutal
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin
To censor you like that one line
I said on Im Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine
Put em all in a line add an AK47 a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was but Im
Morphin into an immortal comin through the portal
Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin cornrows
You write normal Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweathers pad
Singin to a man while he played piano
Man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day Hey Fab Ima kill you
Lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed  JJ Fad 
Uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin Im a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman
Innovative and Im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and
Im devastating more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off theyll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get em motivated
I make elevating music you make elevator music
Oh hes too mainstream
Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
Its not hiphop its popcause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it
I dont know how to make songs like that
I dont know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While Im rippin any one of these verses that versus you
Its curtains Im inadvertently hurtin you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too
Ugh school flunky pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And Im a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
Ima sleep in the front seat
Bumpin Heavy D and the Boyz still Chunky but Funky
But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me
Theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it lifes handin you lemons Make lemonade then
But if I cant batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake em a cake then
Dont mistake him for Satan
Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
Dont be a retardbe a king Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god67K
