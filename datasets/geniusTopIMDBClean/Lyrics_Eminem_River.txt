Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
Hes comin home with his neck scratched to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched
On his breaths Jack hes a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
Its a chess match shes on his back like a jetpack
Shes kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin on to the next
Actually just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
Cause she loves danger psychopath
And you dont fuck with no mans girl even I know that
But shes devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand says their relationships hangin by a strand
So shes been on the web lately
Says maybe shell be my Gwen Stacy to spite her man
And I know shes using me to try to play him I dont care
Hi Suzanne but I shoulda said Bye Suzanne
After the first night but tonight I am
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
A onenight stand turned a twonight stand
It was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and
He found out now she feels deserted and used
Cause he left so what He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that were through
Its hard to find the words Im aloof nervous and Sue
Dont want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Dont take it personal I just cant say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like holeinthewall diners
Dont have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who Im turning intos
Irreversible I preyed on you like its church at the pew
And now that I got you I dont want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do
Get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin the wound
Cause now with her in the womb
We cant bring her in this world shoulda knew
To use protection fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck


Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one I dont want to admit to something
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My names  Ooh  my names  Ooh 
River  Ooh  river run
Call me  Ooh  call me  Ooh 
River  Ooh  well let the river run
Always the bridesmaid never The bride hey
Fuck can I say If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave Id be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate like Im slidin on ice maybe
Thats why I may have came at you sideways
I cant keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
What else can I say It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didnt really wanna abort but fuck it
Whats one more lie to tell our unborn child
Ive been a liar been a thief
Been a lover been a cheat
All my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
Well little one  Im sorry 
I dont want to admit to something  I fucked up 
If all its gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
