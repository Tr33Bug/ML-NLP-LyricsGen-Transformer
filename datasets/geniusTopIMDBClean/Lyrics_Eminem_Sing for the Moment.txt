These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin around with his headphones blarin
Alone in his own zone cold and he dont care hes
A problem child and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out  Bitch 
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked hes mad so hes talkin back
Talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants dorags and a stockin cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose his house is a broken home
Theres no control he just lets his emotions go
Come on  Sing with me  Sing  sing for the year  Sing it 
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  Come on 
Sing it with me its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy only have one homie
Only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate  Huhuh 
I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
Or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
Its like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin on corners and porches just rappin
To havin a fortune no more kissin ass
But then these critics crucify you  Yep  journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin to me religiously
So Im signin CDs while police fingerprint me
Theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
If Im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense B
Its all political if my music is literal
And Im a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldnt I wouldnt be fit to
Youre full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit you  Bitch 
Come on  Sing with me  Sing  sing for the year  Sing it 
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  Sing that shit 
Sing it with me its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
Well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and Ill get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
And they wanna get one cause they think the shits cool
Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves
We entertainers of course the shits affectin our sales
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
Its fucked up aint it How we can come from practically nothin
To bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
Thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine  Haha 
Who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die
Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
Were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes
Thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe theyll admit it when were gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
Sing with me  Sing  sing for the year  Sing it 
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  Come on 
Sing it with me its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me  Sing  sing for the year  Sing it 
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  Come on 
Sing it with me its just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
