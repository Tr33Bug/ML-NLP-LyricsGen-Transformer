We touch I feel a rush
We clutch it isnt much
But its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us
Its lust its torturous
You must be a sorceress
Cause you just did the impossible gained my trust
Dont play games itll be dangerous if you fuck me over
Cause if I get burnt Ima show you what its like to hurt
Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil spell it backwards Ill show ya
Nobody knows me Im cold
Walk down this road all alone
Its no ones fault but my own
Its the path Ive chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Dont ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin hoes
Bloodsuckin succubuses what the fuck is up with this
Ive tried in this department but I aint had no luck with this
It sucks but its exactly what I thought it would be like tryin to start over
I got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin I wont go on so you toy with my emotions so its over
Its like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasnt jokin when I told you you take my breath away
Youre a supernova and Im a
Im a spacebound rocket ship and your hearts the Moon
And Im aimin right at you right at you
Twohundredfiftythousand miles on a clear night in June
And Im aimin right at you right at you
Right at you
Ill do whatever it takes
When Im with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I aint with you I have zero strength
Theres no limit on how far I would go no boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks gonna be that one
And then once we get em its never the same
You want em when they dont want you
Soon as they do feelings change
Its not a contest and I aint on no conquest for no mate
I wasnt lookin when I stumbled onto you musta been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Lets cut to the chase fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I wont be makin a mistake cause Im a
Im a spacebound rocket ship and your hearts the Moon
And Im aimin right at you right at you
Twohundredfiftythousand miles on a clear night in June
And Im aimin right at you right at you
Right at you
So after a year and six months its no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you let down my guard swear to God
Ill blow my brains in your lap lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and Im pleadin Im tryna stop you from leavin
You wont even listen so fuck it Im tryna stop you from breathin
I put both hands on your throat I sit on top of you squeezin
Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick aint no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks now I let you go and just give
And fore I put that gun to my temple I told you this
And I woulda done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But its over now its too late to save our love
Just promise me youll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause Im a
Im a spacebound rocket ship and your hearts the Moon
And Im aimin right at you right at you
Twohundredfiftythousand miles on a clear night in June
And Im so lost without you without you
Without you
