My teas gone cold Im wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I cant see at all
And even if I could itd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad its not so bad

But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that its not so bad its not so bad
Dear Slim I wrote you but you still aint callin
I left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn you must notve got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways fuck it whats been up man Hows your daughter
My girlfriends pregnant too Im bout to be a father
If I have a daughter guess what Ima call her
Ima name her Bonnie

I aint mad I just think its fucked up you dont answer fans
If you didnt want to talk to me outside your concert you didnt have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
Thats my little brother man hes only six years old
We waited in the blisterin cold
For you for four hours and you just said no
Thats pretty shitty man youre like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man he likes you more than I do
I aint that mad though I just dont like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if Id write you you would write back
See Im just like you in a way I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what youre sayin in your songs
So when I have a shitty day I drift away and put em on
Cause I dont really got shit else
So that shit helps when Im depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
Its like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriends jealous cause I talk about you 247
But she dont know you like I know you Slim no one does
She dont know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man Ill be the biggest fan youll ever lose

Dear Stan I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriends pregnant now how far along is she
Look Im really flattered you would call your daughter that
And heres an autograph for your brother I wrote it on a Starter cap

Dont think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But whats this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clownin dawg come on how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan I think you need some counselin
To help your ass from bouncin off the walls when you get down some
And whats this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shitll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself I think that youll be doin just fine
If you relax a little Im glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just dont want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to
Come to think about it his name wasit was you
Damn
