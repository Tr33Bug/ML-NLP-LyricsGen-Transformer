You used to say that Id never be
Nothin without you and Id believe
Im shot in the lungs I gasp I cant breathe
Just lay here with me baby hold me please
And Id beg and Id plead drop to knees
And Id cry and Id scream Baby please dont leave
Snatch the keys from your hand I would squeeze
And youd laugh and youd tease
Youre just fucking with me and you must hate me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick
And youve had enough of me
I smother you Im bout to jump off the edge
But you wont break me
Youll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you I bet you Ill be just fine without you
And if I stumble I wont crumble
Ill get back up and uhh
But Ima still be humble when I scream Fuck you
Cause Im stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you have
Cause on the inside youre ugly and mad
But youre all that I love I grasp you cant leave
Please stay here with me baby hold me please
And Id beg and Id plead drop to knees
And Id cry and Id scream Baby please dont leave
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin nothin for me
So please dont wake me from this dream baby
Were still together in my head
And youre still in love with me
Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you wont break me
Youll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you I bet you Ill be just fine without you
And if I stumble I wont crumble
Ill get back up and uhh
But Ima still be humble when I scream Fuck you
Cause Im stronger than I was


You walked out I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
Id rather die than you not be by my side
Cant count how many times I vomited cried
Go to my room turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I why did I think it was ride or die
Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
Its like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too shoulda
Put up more of a fight but I couldnt
At the time no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now whats the likelihood of that
Bite me bitch chew on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But Im breakin out of this slump Im in
Pullin myself out of the dumps once again
Im gettin up once and for allfuck this shit
Ima be late for the pity party
But youre never gonna beat me to the fuckin punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So dont lump me in with them chumpions
Im done bein your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar was gonna call
But couldnt think of the words to say
But they came to me just nowso I put em in a verse to lay
And I thank you  Uh  cause you made me  Uh 
A better person than I was
But I hate you  Uh  cause you drained me  Uh 
I gave you all you gave me none
But if you blame me  Uh  youre crazy  Uh 
And after all is said and done
Im still angry yeah I may be
I may never trust someone
But you wont break me
Youll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you I bet you Ill be just fine without you
And if I stumble I wont crumble
Ill get back up and uhh
But Ima still be humble when I scream Fuck you
Cause Im stronger than I was
