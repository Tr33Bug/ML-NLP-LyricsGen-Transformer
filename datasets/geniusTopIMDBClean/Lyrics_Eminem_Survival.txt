Yeah
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all aall aall aall
Wasnt ready to be no millionaire I was illprepared
I was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
From the beginning it wasnt bout the ends it was bout
Bustin raps and standin for somethin fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin act like youre happy Im fuckin back again
With another anthem  why stop when it doesnt have to end
It aint over til I say its over enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up Im afraid of Whatll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit I salivate at it wait is up
Hands up like its 12 noon nah homie hold them bitches straighter up
Wave em til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough came to ruffle feathers nah egos I aint deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt cause
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all aall aall aall
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
Im so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I dont got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can man will I survive in this climate or what
They said I was washedup and got a bloodbath
Im not a rapper Im an adapter I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floors open if youd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muhfucka and if I dont make the cut
What Like I give a fuck Ima light this bitch up like Im driving a truck
Through the side of a pump zero to sixty hop in and gun it
Like GUnit without the hyphen Im hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut
And I look like I might just give up eh mightve mistook
Me for bowin out I aint takin a bow Im stabbin myself
With a fuckin knife in the gut while Im wipin my butt
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut
Cause Ima fight til I die or win bitin the dust
Itll just make me angrier wait let me remind you of what
Got me this far picture me quittin
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
Its survival of what
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all aall aall aall
So take it all aall aall aall
Yeah  So get your ideas stack your ammo
But dont come unless you come to battle now mount up jump in the saddle
This is itits what you eat sleep piss and shit
Live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit fuse is lit cant defuse the wick
I dont do this music shit Ill lose my shit
Aint got shit to lose its the moment of truth its all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth I spit
But my respect is overdue Im showin you the flow no one do
Cause I dont own no diploma for school I quit
So theres nothin for me to fall back on I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin mics in for some toolboxes
Cause youll never take my pride from me itll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me I dont want you to buhlieve
Cause this is somethin that I must use to succeed
And if you dont like me then fuck you Selfesteem
Must be fuckin shootin through the roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you I must be
Allergic to failure cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze but I just go achoo then achieve
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all aall aall aall
So take it all aall aall aall
