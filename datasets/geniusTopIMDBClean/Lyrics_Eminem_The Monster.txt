Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wantin my cake and eat it too and wantin it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew see but it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to dos be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo Hit the lottery oohwee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin a used mink
Ironic cause I think Im gettin so huge I need a shrink
Im beginnin to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
Goin coocoo and kooky as Kool Keith
But Im actually weirder than you think cause Im
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed

Now I aint much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And dont squander it cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow so I keep conjurin
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah ponderinll do you wonders
No wonder youre losin your mind the way it wanders
Yodelodelayheehoo I think it went wanderin off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I loves killin me and I cant conquer it
My OCDs conkin me in the head keep knockin
Nobodys home Im sleepwalkin
Im just relayin what the voice in my heads sayin
Dont shoot the messenger Im just friends with the


Im friends with the monster thats under my bed

Call me crazy but I have this vision one day that
Ill walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and
Im comin straight at MCs blood gets spilled and
Ill take you back to the days that Id get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumpedup feelin
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I aint here to save the fuckin children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin through a struggle feels it and relates thats great
Its payback Russell Wilson fallin way back
In the draft turn nothin into somethin still can make that
Straw into gold chump I will spinRumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts I am nuts for real but Im okay with that
Its nothin Im still friends with the
