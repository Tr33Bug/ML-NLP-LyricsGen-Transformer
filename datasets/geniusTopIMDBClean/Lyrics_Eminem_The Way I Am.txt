Man whatever
Dre just let it run
Ayo turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it shut up and listen
Ayo
I sit back with this pack of ZigZags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth Ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress thats been eatin me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully  Peacefully 
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone when you freaks see me out
In the streets when Im eatin or feedin my daughter
To not come and speak to me  Speak to me  I dont know you
And no I dont owe you a motherfuckin thing
Im not Mr NSync Im not what your friends think
Im not Mr Friendly I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty  Is on empty 
No patience is in me and if you offend me
Im liftin you ten feet  Liftin you ten feet  in the air
I dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
Ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
Im tired of all you  Of all you  I dont mean to be mean
But thats all I can be its just me
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the paper the news every day I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the paper the news every day I am
I dont know thats just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense its constant
And Oh its his lyrical content
The song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me  Finger at me 
So I point one back at em but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
When you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
With the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn  On Marilyn  and the heroin
Where were the parents at And look where its at
Middle America now its a tragedy
Now its so sad to see an upperclass city
Havin this happenin  This happenin  then attack
Eminem cause I rap this way  Rap this way  but Im glad
Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And its burnin and I have returned
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the paper the news every day I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the paper the news every day I am
I dont know thats just the way I am
Im so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label lets stop with the fables
Im not gonna be able to top a My Name Is
And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock n roll stations
And I just do not got the patience  Got the patience 
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think Im some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin the same fuckin questions  Fuckin questions 
What school did I go to what hood I grew up in
The why the who what when the where and the how
Til Im grabbin my hair and Im tearin it out
Cause they drivin me crazy  Drivin me crazy  I cant take it
Im racin Im pacin I stand and I sit
And Im thankful for every fan that I get
But I cant take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin by it  Standin by it  No I wont sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole Im glad
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the paper the news every day I am
Radio wont even play my jam
Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasnt then why would I say I am
In the paper the news every day I am
I dont know thats just the way I am
