Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo left yo left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo left right left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo left yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo left right left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo left yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo left right left
And not be a quitter no matter how bad
Yo left yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo left right left
Til I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em
Til the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
Cause when I am not then Ima stop pennin em
And I am not hiphop and Im just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when Ima stop sendin em
Women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
Amoxicillins just not real enough
The criminal copkillin hiphop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Youre comin with me feel it or not
Youre gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up
Fa shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up
You bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck
Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
Until the roof until the roof
Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
The roof comes off the roof comes off
Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
Until my legs until my legs
Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
Music is like magic theres a certain feelin you get
When you real and you spit and people are feelin your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it cause you may never get it again
So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when its at its end
Cause Im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list heres the order of my list that its in
It goes Reggie JayZ 2Pac and Biggie
Andr from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me
But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy
So when Im not put on this list the shit does not offend me
Thats why you see me walk around like nothings botherin me
Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The presss wet dream like Bobby and Whitney  Nate hit me
Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
Until the roof until the roof
Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
The roof comes off the roof comes off
Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
Until my legs until my legs
Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart
What is he thinking How not to go against me smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
Ill probly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse
Thats why Im clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a fullblown attack Im launchin at em
The track is on some battlin raps who wants some static
Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if Im not the baddest so
Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
Until the roof until the roof
Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
The roof comes off the roof comes off
Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
Until my legs until my legs
Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
Until the roof until the roof
The roof comes off the roof comes off
Until my legs until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I I will not fall I will stand tall
Feels like no one could beat me
