I walk on water
But I aint no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes  Fuck 
Why are expectations so high Is it the bar I set
My arms I stretch but I cant reach
A far cry from it or its in my grasp but as
Soon as I grab squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet now the skys blackening
I know the marks high butter
Flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin that no matter what bars I come with
Youre gonna harp gripe and
Thats a hard Vicodin to swallow so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking because
I walk on water
But I aint no Jesus
Its the curse of the its the curse of the 
I walk on water  Shit 
But only when it freezes
Its the curse of the standard that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I havent spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect
Ive garnered The rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless
And it always feels like Im hittin the mark
Til I go sit in the car listen and pick it apart
Like This shit is garbage
Gods given me all this still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god this is retarded
If only they knew its a facade and its exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
Im not Godsent Nas Rakim Pac BIG James Todd Smith
And Im not Prince so
I walk on water
But I aint no Jesus
I walk on water
Its true Im a Rubiks its true 
But only when it freezes
Its true 
Cause Im only human just like you
Making my mistakes oh if you only knew
I dont think you should believe in me the way that you do
Cause Im terrified to let you down oh
Its true Im a Rubiksa beautiful mess
At times juvenile yes I goof and I jest
A flawed human I guess
But Im doin my best to not ruin your ex
Pectations and meet em but first
The Speedom verse now Big Sean
Hes goin too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom
There was a time I had the world by the balls eatin out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin the fuck out on
And now Im gettin clowned and frowned on
But the only one whos looking down on
Me that matters nows DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all thats left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And its time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline the curtains drawn
Theyre closin the set Im still pokin my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt remind
Now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times
Now let em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight outta mind I might go outta mine
Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin tightrope outta twine
But when I do fall from these heights though Ill be fine
I wont pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But Ill decide if its my final bow this time around cause
I walk on water
But I aint no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
Cause Im only human just like you
Ive been making my mistakes oh if you only knew
I dont think you should believe in me the way that you do
Cause Im terrified to let you down oh
If I walked on water I would drown
Cause Im just a man
But as long as I got a mic Im godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch I wrote Stan
