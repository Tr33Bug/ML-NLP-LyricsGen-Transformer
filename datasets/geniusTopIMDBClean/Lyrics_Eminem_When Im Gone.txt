Yeah its my life
In my own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for
Not the expression no literally give an arm for
When they know theyre your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
Daddy look what I made Dads gotta go catch a plane
Daddy wheres Mommy I cant find Mommy where is she
I dont know go play Hailie baby your daddys busy
Daddys writin a song this song aint gon write itself
Ill give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother whos a spitting image of her

I hear applause all this time I couldnt see
How could it be that the curtain is closin on me
I turn around find a gun on the ground cock it
Put it to my brain scream Die Shady and pop it
The sky darkens my life flashes the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
Thats when I wake up alarm clocks ringin theres birds singin
Its spring and Hailies outside swingin
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say
