Yea though we ventured through the valley of the stars
You in all your jewelry and my bleeding heart
Who couldnt be together and who could not be apart
We shouldve jumped out of that airplane after all
Flying skyways overhead it wasnt hard to fall
And I had so many crashes that I couldnt feel at all
And it feels like Im seventeen again
Feels like Im seventeen again
Time might break you god forsake you
Leave you burnt and bruised
Innocence will teach you what it feels like to be used
Thought that youd done everything you didnt have a clue
And it feels like Im seventeen again
Feels like Im seventeen again
Looking from the outside in
Some things never change
Hey hey Im a million miles away
Funny how it seems like yesterday
All those fake celebrities and all those vicious queens
All the stupid papers and the stupid magazines
Sweet dreams are made of anything
That gets you in the scene
And it feels like Im seventeen again
And it feels like Im seventeen again
Yes it feels like Im seventeen again
Seventeen seventeen again yeah yeah yeah


Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree
I travelled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys looking for something yeah
