Underneath this canopy of snow
Where fiftyseven winters
Took their toll
Where did you go
And I believed in you
I believed in you
Like Elvis Presley
Singing psalms on a Sunday
Where did you go
Well shes gone to meet her maker
Back to where she came from
Come to save her soul
Come to save her soul
Come to save her soul
Come to take her home
Cause its late and past
Your bedtime
Well past bedtime
Angel
My angel
Fly over me
Angel
Angel
My angel
Fly over me
Angel
She took her life
Within her hands
She took her life
Within her own two hands
And noone can tell her
What to do now
And I believed in you
I believed in you
Like Elvis Presley
Singin live from Las Vegas
Where did you go


Well shes gone to meet her maker
Back to where she came from
Come to save her soul
Come to save her soul
Come to save her soul
Come to take her home
Cause its late and past
Your bedtime
Well past bedtime
Angel
My angel
Fly over me
Angel
Angel
My angel
Fly over me
Angel
Close your eyes
Go to sleep
Forever in my heart
Ill keep you save
Forever
Ill keep you save
Angel
My angel
Angel
My angel
Angel
Angel
Angel
Angel
My angel
Fly over me
Angel
Angel
My angel
