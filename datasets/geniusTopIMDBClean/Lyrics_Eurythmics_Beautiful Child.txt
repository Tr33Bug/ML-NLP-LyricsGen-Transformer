Something that I said
Made you wear a frown
The way you hang your head
Has made the tears come down
But dont you wear a sigh
My beautiful child
You know it doesnt burn
When you touch the sun
So dont be concerned
My golden one
Youre gonna reach the sky
Fly
Beautiful child
There is no other place
The human race
Is running out of space
There is no better love
And human love
Is what it takes
And Ill be at your side
When youre falling down
Youll be feeling fine
When you hit the ground
So dont slip away
Stay
Beautiful child
