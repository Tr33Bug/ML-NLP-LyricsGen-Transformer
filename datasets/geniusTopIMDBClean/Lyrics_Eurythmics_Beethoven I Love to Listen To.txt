Beethoven (I Love to Listen To) Lyrics
Listen to...
Listen to...
Listen to...

I love to listen to...
I love to listen to...
I love to listen to...
I love to...
Take a girl like that
Take a girl...
And put her in a natural setting
Put her in a setting
Like a cafe for example
Like a cafe...
Along comes the boy
Along comes the boy
And he's looking for trouble
With a girl like that
With a girl like that
Who knows what they'll decide to do
Who knows what they'll get up to
I'd love to know
Wouldn't you?

I love to listen to...
I love to listen to...
I love to listen to...
I love to...

I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to...

You think you know just what you want?
You think you know just what you want?
But you have used that weapon against me
But you have used that weapon against me
Did I tell you I was lying by the way?
Did I tell you I was lying by the way?
When I said I wanted a new mink coat?
When I said I wanted a new mink coat?
I was just thinking about something sleek
I was just thinking about something sleek
To wrap around my tender throat
I was dreaming like a Texan girl
I was dreaming like a Texan girl
A girl who thinks she's got the right to everything
A girl who thinks she's got the right to everything
A girl who thinks she should have something extreme
A girl who thinks she should have something extreme

I love to listen to...
I love to listen to...
I love to listen to...
I love to...

I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to...
Beethoven
I love to...
Beethoven

I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...
I love to listen to Beethoven...Embed
