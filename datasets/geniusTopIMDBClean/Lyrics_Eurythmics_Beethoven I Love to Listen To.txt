Beethoven  I Love to Listen To  Lyrics
Listen to
Listen to
Listen to
I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to
Take a girl like that
Take a girl
And put her in a natural setting
Put her in a setting
Like a cafe for example
Like a cafe
Along comes the boy
Along comes the boy
And hes looking for trouble
With a girl like that
With a girl like that
Who knows what theyll decide to do
Who knows what theyll get up to
Id love to know
Wouldnt you
I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to
You think you know just what you want
You think you know just what you want
But you have used that weapon against me
But you have used that weapon against me
Did I tell you I was lying by the way
Did I tell you I was lying by the way
When I said I wanted a new mink coat
When I said I wanted a new mink coat
I was just thinking about something sleek
I was just thinking about something sleek
To wrap around my tender throat
I was dreaming like a Texan girl
I was dreaming like a Texan girl
A girl who thinks shes got the right to everything
A girl who thinks shes got the right to everything
A girl who thinks she should have something extreme
A girl who thinks she should have something extreme
I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to listen to
I love to
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to
Beethoven
I love to
Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
I love to listen to Beethoven
