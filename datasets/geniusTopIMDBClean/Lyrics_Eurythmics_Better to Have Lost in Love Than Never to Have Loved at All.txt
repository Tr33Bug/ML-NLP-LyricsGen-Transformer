Better to Have Lost in Love  Than Never to Have Loved at All  LyricsCool tears flow upon my pillow
And Im freezing blue with misery
You know that I never meant to hurt you
But something always gets right in the way
So Ill fill this bedrom full of mystery
Hang our last conclusions on the wall
And if this empty building starts to get to me
Please remember that it just might be your fault
Better to have lost in love
Than never to have loved at all
So the fated lovers turn to enemies 
And all their hidden feelings start to show
And I never though that boy
Could mean so much to me
And now it seems Ill have to let you go
