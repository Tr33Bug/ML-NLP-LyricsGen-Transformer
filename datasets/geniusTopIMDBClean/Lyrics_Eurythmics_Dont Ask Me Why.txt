Miracle of miracles
Look what the night dragged in
Its a pocket full of misery
And trouble on the wind
You spoiled the best years of your life
You took them all in vain
Now you think that youre forgiven
But you cant be born again
You say why
You say why
You say why
Dont ask me why
I dont love you anymore
I dont think I ever did
And if you ever had
Any kind of love for me
You kept it all so well hid
Promises sweet promises
You kept them from your mind
Like all the lost forgotten things
You never seemed to find
Like all the disappointments
You displayed upon your shelf
Now youve got noone to turn to
Youve got noone but yourself
And you say why
You say why
You say why
Dont ask me why
I dont love you anymore
I dont think I ever did
And if you ever had
Any kind of love for me
You kept it all so well hid
You spoiled the best years of your life
You took them all in vain
Now you think that youre forgiven
But you cant be born again
And you say why
Why why why why why
Why why why why why
Why why why why
And you say why
Why why why why why
Why why why why why
Why why why why
I dont love you anymore
I dont love you anymore
I dont love you anymore
And you say why
I dont love you anymore
You say why
I dont love you anymore
You say why
I dont love you anymore
Dont ask me why
I dont love you anymore
You say why
I dont love you anymore
You say why
I dont love you anymore
You say why
I dont love you anymore
Dont ask me why
I dont love you anymore
