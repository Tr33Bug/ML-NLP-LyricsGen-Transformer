Like a train passing in the distance
Like a bird in flight
I hear you call
And even though theres no one
Dark shadows move across the wall
I still hear the echoes
Of your footsteps on the stairs
Still recall the images that
Seem to linger there
Faces seem like fingerprints
Like skeletons of leaves upon the lawn
People changing places
Lasting for a moment
Then its gone
I still hear the echoes
Of your footsteps on the stairs
Still recall the images that
Seem to linger there
Like a train passing in the distance
Like a bird in flight
I hear you call
And even though theres no one
Dark shadows move across the wall
I still hear the sound of
Conversation from the hall
Look to see whos coming
But its nothing
And theres no one there at all
No one there at all
