Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you
So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do
Here comes the rain again
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Tearing me apart like a new emotion  Ooh 
I want to breathe in the open wind
I want to kiss like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you
So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me  Ooh 
Like lovers do
So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Here it comes again
Ooh
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion  Here it comes again here it comes again ah 
I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you  Ooh here it comes again 
Here comes the rain again  I said 
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion  Ooh ooh yeah 
I want to walk in the open wind  Mhm 
I want to talk like lovers do
Want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you
Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion
