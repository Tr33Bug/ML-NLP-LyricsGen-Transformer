Home Is Where the Heart Is Lyrics
Home is where the heart is
At least that’s what they say
Gave me indications
Can’t be far away

Home is where the heart is (Heart is)
Now I’ve understood
Home is still a stranger
It’s never any good
Home is just a story (Story)
A room without a view
A room without a view
Pretty picture on the wall
Memories of you

Memories
Memories
Memories

Home is where the heart is (Heart is)
At least that’s what they say
Gave me indications
Can’t be far away

Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far away
Can’t be far awayYou might also likeEmbed
