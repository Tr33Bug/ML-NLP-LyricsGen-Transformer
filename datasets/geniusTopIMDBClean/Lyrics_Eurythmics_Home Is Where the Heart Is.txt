Home is where the heart is
At least thats what they say
Gave me indications
Cant be far away
Home is where the heart is  Heart is 
Now Ive understood
Home is still a stranger
Its never any good
Home is just a story  Story 
A room without a view
A room without a view
Pretty picture on the wall
Memories of you
Memories
Memories
Memories
Home is where the heart is  Heart is 
At least thats what they say
Gave me indications
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
Cant be far away
