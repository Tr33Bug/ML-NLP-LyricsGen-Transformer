I Could Give You  A Mirror  Lyrics
Oh how can you be so cold
With my arms to hold you
How can you be so cold
With my arms to enfold you
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me
Oh how can you be so cold
When theres a fire burning
How can you be so cold
When all the ice is melting
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me
Oh how can you be so cold
With my arms to hold you
How can you be so cold
With my arms to enfold you
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me
I could give you a mirror
To show you disappointments
I could give you a history
Could you ever listen in to me
