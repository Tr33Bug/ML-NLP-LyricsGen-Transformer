I need you to pin me down
Just for one frozen moment
I need someone to pin me down
So I can live in torment
I need you to really feel
The twist of my back breaking
I need someone to listen
To the ecstasy Im faking
I need you you you
I need you you you
I need you to catch each breath
That issues from my lips
I need someone to crack my skull
I need someone to kiss
So hold me now
And make pretend
That I wont ever fall
Oh hold me down
Im gonna be your baby doll
Yeah yeah
I need you I need you I need you
You you
I need you you you
I need you to pin me down
Just for one frozen moment
I need someone to pin me down
So I can live in torment
I need you to really feel
The twist of my back breaking
I need someone to listen
To the ecstasy Im faking faking
Im faking Im faking


You you you
I need you
I need you you you
Is it you I really need
I do I do I do I do I do
I really do
I need you
