I Need a Man Lyrics
Hey!
Is this my turn?
You want me to sing now?
Okay!

I don't care if you won't talk to me
You know I'm not that kind of girl
And I don't care if you won't walk with me
It don't give me such a thrill
And I don't care about the way you look
You should know I'm not impressed
'Cause there's just one thing that I'm looking for
And he don't wear a dress
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man

Baby, baby, baby don't you shave your legs
Don't you double comb your hair
Don't powder puff just leave it rough
I like your fingers bare
When the night comes down
I can turn it round, I can take you anywhere
I don't need love forget that stuff
You know that I don't care

I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man

I don't need a heart breaker, fifty-faced trouble maker
Two-timing time taker, dirty little money maker
Muscle-bound cheap skate, low down woman hater
Triple-crossing double dater, yella bellied alligator
You might also like
I don't care if you won't talk to me
You know I'm not that kind of girl
And I don't care if you won't walk with me
It don't give me such a thrill
And I don't care about the way you look
You should know I'm not impressed
'Cause there's just one thing that I'm looking for
And he don't wear a dress

I need a man, leave me alone
I need a man, don't take me home
I need a man, baby you're just overblown

Hey, boy, c'mon
I'll take you anytime
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
