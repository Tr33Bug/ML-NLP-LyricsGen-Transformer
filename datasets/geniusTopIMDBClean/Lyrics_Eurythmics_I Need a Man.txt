Hey
Is this my turn
You want me to sing now
Okay
I dont care if you wont talk to me
You know Im not that kind of girl
And I dont care if you wont walk with me
It dont give me such a thrill
And I dont care about the way you look
You should know Im not impressed
Cause theres just one thing that Im looking for
And he dont wear a dress
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
Baby baby baby dont you shave your legs
Dont you double comb your hair
Dont powder puff just leave it rough
I like your fingers bare
When the night comes down
I can turn it round I can take you anywhere
I dont need love forget that stuff
You know that I dont care
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I need a man
I dont need a heart breaker fiftyfaced trouble maker
Twotiming time taker dirty little money maker
Musclebound cheap skate low down woman hater
Triplecrossing double dater yella bellied alligator


I dont care if you wont talk to me
You know Im not that kind of girl
And I dont care if you wont walk with me
It dont give me such a thrill
And I dont care about the way you look
You should know Im not impressed
Cause theres just one thing that Im looking for
And he dont wear a dress
I need a man leave me alone
I need a man dont take me home
I need a man baby youre just overblown
Hey boy cmon
Ill take you anytime
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Baby baby baby
Baby
