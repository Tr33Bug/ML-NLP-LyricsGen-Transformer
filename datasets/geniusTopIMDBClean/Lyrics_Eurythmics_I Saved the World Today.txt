Monday finds you like a bomb
Its been left ticking there too long
Youre bleeding
Some days theres nothing left to learn
From the point of no return
Youre leaving
Hey hey I saved the world today
Everybodys happy now
The bad things gone away
And everybodys happy now
The good things here to stay
Please let it stay
Theres a million mouths to feed
But Ive got everything I need
Im breathing
And theres a hurting thing inside
But Ive got everything to hide
Im grieving
Hey hey I saved the world today
And everybodys happy now
The bad things gone away
And everybodys happy now
The good things here to stay
Please let it stay
Let it stay let it stay
Doo doo doo doo doo the good thing
Hey hey I saved the world today
And everybodys happy now
The bad things gone away
And everybodys happy now
The good things here to stay
Please let it stay


Hey hey I saved the world today
And everybodys happy now
And everybodys happy now
The bad things gone away
Everybodys happy now  So happy now 
And everybodys happy now
The good things here to stay
Please let it ooh let it
