Its Alright  Babys Coming Back  LyricsIts alright babys coming back
And I dont really care where hes been no
Its alright babys coming back
And I wont turn him around this time no no no
Ill be your cliff  you can fall down from me 
Ill be your ledge  you can lean upon me 
Ill be your bridge  your flowering tree 
You can still depend on me
And Ill be  the ticking of your clock 
And Ill be  the numbers on your watch 
And Ill be  your hands to stop the time 
Ill even be your danger sign
Its alright babys coming back
And I dont really care where hes been no
Its alright babys coming back
And I wont turn him around this time no
And Ill be  your grace your dignity 
And Ill be  your night your destiny 
And Ill be  your comfort and your ease 
I will be your storm at seas
And Ill be  your sharp intake of breath 
And Ill be  your work Ill take no rest 
And when the world falls to decline
Ill be yours and youll be mine
Its alright babys coming back
And I dont really care where hes been no
And Ill be  your cliff you can fall down from me 
And Ill be  your ledge you can lean upon me 
And Ill be  your bridge your flowering tree
You can still depend on me
And Ill be  the ticking of your clock 
And Ill be  the numbers on your watch 
And Ill be  your hands to stop the time 
Ill even be your danger sign
Its alright babys coming back
And I wont turn him around this time
Its alright babys coming back  Make it easy on yourself tonight  
And I dont really care where hes been no
Its alright babys coming back
And I wont turn him around this time no
Its alright babys coming back
And I dont really care where hes been no
Its alright babys coming back
And I wont turn him around this time no
