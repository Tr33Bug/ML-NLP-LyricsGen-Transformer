Turn it down so I cant hear it
Turn it out so I cant see it
Its just useless to ignore
Were going down but you dont feel it
Turn it round you dont mean it
And I cant stand it anymore
When the whole world sighs
And its making you so deflated
Ive got a light
Though it refuses to shine
Ive got a life
It aint over it aint over  got a life 
Ive got a way
Its the only thing thats mine  got a way 
All Im asking for is tenderness
A little tenderness
Tenderness
Oh its a cruel place
And you never asked to be here
And nobody cares and no ones gonna help you now  ho no 
Its dogeatdog  dogeatdog  the human race
The only thing theyll do is hate you
Hate you
Its such a crime
To be unkind
You turn your cheek
Pretend youre blind
Ive got a light
Though it refuses to shine  got a light 
Ive got a life
It aint over it aint over  got a life 
Ive got a way
Its the only thing thats mine  got a way 
All Im asking for is tenderness
Tenderness

Ive got a light
Though it refuses to shine  got a light 
Ive got a life
It aint over it aint over  got a life 
Ive got a way
Its the only thing thats mine  got a way 
All Im asking for is tenderness
Tenderness
Strong now baby  Ive got a light 
Gotta be strong now baby  though it refuses to shine 
Got a light 
Gotta be strong  Ive got a life 
Gotta be strong  It aint over it aint over   Got a life 
Strong now baby  Ive got a way 
Gotta be strong now baby  got a way 
Gotta be strong
