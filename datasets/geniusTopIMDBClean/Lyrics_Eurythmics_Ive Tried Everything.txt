The truth of life is the greatest gift
But I dont think I can make it fit
And who would guess it would come to this
When Ive tried everything
And I should know but I cant explain
The endless noise sounding in my brain
Who wouldve thought that you could feel such pain
When youve tried everything
Yea youre a loser now
Yea youre a loser now
I should be cool
But Im burning hot
I should be good
But I fell apart
Dont look at me now dont even start
Cause Ive tried everything
Yea Youre a loser now
Yea Youre a loser now
