Love is a stranger in an open car
To tempt you in and drive you far away
Ooh love is a stranger in an open car
To tempt you in and drive you far away
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession
Love is a danger of a different kind
To take you away and leave you far behind
And love love love is a dangerous drug
You have to receive it and you still cant get enough of the stuff
Its savage and its cruel and it shines like destruction
Comes in like the flood and it seems like religion
Its noble and its brutal it distorts and deranges
And it wrenches you up and youre left like a zombie
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession
Its guilt edged glamorous and sleek by design
You know its jealous by nature false and unkind
Its hard and restrained and its totally cool
It touches and it teases as you stumble in the debris
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you so
Its an obsession
