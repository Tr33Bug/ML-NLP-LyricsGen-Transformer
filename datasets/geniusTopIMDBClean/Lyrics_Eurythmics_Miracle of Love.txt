How many sorrows
Do you try to hide
In a world of illusion
Thats covering your mind
Ill show you something good
Oh Ill show you something good
When you open your mind
Youll discover the sign
That theres something youre longing to find
The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again
Cruel is the night
That covers up your fears
Tender is the one
That wipes away your tears
There must be a bitter breeze
To make you sting so viciously
They say the greatest coward
Can hurt the most ferociously
But Ill show you something good
Oh Ill show you something good
If you open your heart
You can make a new start
When your crumbling world falls apart
The miracle of love
Will take away your pain
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again


The miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Will take away your pain  Must take a miracle 
When the miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Comes your way again  Must take a miracle 
The miracle of love
Will take away your pain  In this heartless world 
When the miracle of love
Comes your way again  Ooh you know it must you know it must 
The miracle of love  People try to hurt you 
Will take away your pain  Try to hurt you if they could 
When the miracle of love  And it must take a miracle 
Comes your way again  Ooh 
The miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Will take away your pain  Must take a miracle 
When the miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Comes your way again  Must take a miracle 
The miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Will take away your pain  Must take a miracle 
When the miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Comes your way again  Must take a miracle 
The miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Will take away your pain  Must take a miracle 
When the miracle of love  Must take a miracle 
Comes your way again  Must take a miracle
