Well I was born an original sinner
I was born from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things Ive done
Thered be a mountain of money piled up to my chin hey
My mother told me good my mother told me strong
She said be true to yourself and you cant go wrong
But theres just one thing that you must understand
You can fool with your brother
But dont mess with a missionary man
Dont mess with a missionary man
Dont mess with a missionary man
Dont mess with a missionary man
Oh the missionary man hes got God on his side
Hes got the saints and apostles backing up from behind
Black eyed looks from those Bible books
Hes a man with a mission got a serious mind
There was a woman in the jungle and a monkey on a tree
The missionary man he was following me
He said Stop what youre doing Get down upon your knees
Ive a message for you that you better believe
Oh yeah Hey Hey Oh
Well I was born an original sinner
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things Ive done
Thered be a mountain of money
Dont mess with a missionary man
Missionary man
Missionary man
Missionary man
Dont mess with a missionary man
Missionary man
