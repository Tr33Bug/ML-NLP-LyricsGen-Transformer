No Fear No Hate No Pain  No Broken Hearts  Lyrics
Well in the morning
When our day begins
And it feels like cold cold cold cold steel
Ha
And when the sun comes up
Its like a new commotion
You say nobody told you
It would feel like this
Ha
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
Youve got the killing gun
Held in your hand
It feels like cold cold cold cold steel
And when the sun comes up
Its makes a new commotion
You say shoot shoot shoot it up
Shoot it up
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
And when the sun comes up
Its like a new commotion
You say nobody told you
It would feel like this
Ha


No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
No fear no hate no pain no broken hearts
