Ive got a delicate mind
Ive got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture
Ive got a delicate mind
Ive got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture
Im an electric wire
And Im stuck inside your head
Im a hungry Mohican
Ive got a razorblade smile
So dont come near me
Ive got a singular style
Fifteen senses
Are on my plate
All the things
That you love to hate
Im an electric wire
And Im stuck inside your head
Where I go to no one knows
Find me where the cold wind blows
Where I go to no one knows
Find me where the cold wind blows
