Regrets Lyrics
I've got a delicate mind
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture
I've got a delicate mind
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture

I'm an electric wire
And I'm stuck inside your head
I'm a hungry Mohican
I've got a razor-blade smile
So don't come near me
I've got a singular style
Fifteen senses
Are on my plate
All the things
That you love to hate

I'm an electric wire
And I'm stuck inside your head

Where I go to no one knows
Find me where the cold wind blows
Where I go to no one knows
Find me where the cold wind blows
Regrets! (Yeah!)

I've got a delicate mind (Regrets!)
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides (Regrets!)
With your furniture
I've got a delicate mind (Regrets!)
I've got a dangerous...
And my fist collides
With your furniture

I'm an electric wire
I'm an electric wire
I'm an electric wire

Regrets!
Black is red and red is white
In this country I do what I like
Regrets!
I say, black is red (Regrets!)
Regrets!
And red is white
Do what I like (Regrets!)
Yeah!

Regrets!
That's right, that's right
That's right, that's right
That's right, that's right
That's right, that's right
Yeah!
Regrets!
Red is white (Regrets!)
Black is red and red is white
In this country I do what I like
Black is red and red is white
Regrets!
In this country I do what I like
Do what I like
Do what I like
Regrets!
Regrets!
