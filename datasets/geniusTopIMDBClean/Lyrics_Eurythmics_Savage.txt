Words of power are killing me
While the sun displays its teeth
All mockery is laughing
All violence is cheap
She said
These are my guns
These are my furs
This is my living room
You can play with me there sometimes
If you catch me in the mood
Savage
Savage
Savage
You savage
She said
I have this unhappiness
To wear around my neck
Its a pretty piece of jewellery
To show what I protect
She said
Everything is fiction
All cynic to the bone
So dont ask me to stay with you
Dont ask to see me home

You savage
Savage
Savage
You
You 
You savage


Savage
Savage
Savage
You savage
