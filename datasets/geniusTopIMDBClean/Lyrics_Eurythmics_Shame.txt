Shame
Now theres a lifestyle
With painted lips
Now theres a lifestyle
Everybody wants it
But it dont exist
And I said shame
In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame
On the TV and the media
Shame
We loved you
Shame
In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame
On the TV and the media
Shame
We loved you
Now theres a lifestyle
With fashion chic
Now theres a lifestyle
Everybody in it wants
To be elite
And I said
You with yer brand new shoes and
You with yer greasy hair and
You with yer mothers pride and poetry
Dont you want to feel the shame
In the dancehalls
Cant you feel the shame
And the TV
Cant you feel no shame
We loved you
Shame
In the dancehalls and the cinema
Shame
On the TV and the media
Shame
We loved you
Shame
At the Lido and the opera
Shame
At the races and the theatre
Shame
We loved you
And they said all we need is love
Shame
In the dancehalls
All we need is love
And the TV
All we need is love
We loved you
With the Beatles and the Rolling Stones
Shame
At the Lido and the opera
Shame
At the races
And the theatre
Shame
We loved you
Day after day  In the dancehalls 
Day after day In the dancehalls 
Day after day In the dancehalls
