Now there was a time
When they used to say
That behind every great man
There had to be a great woman
But in these times of change
You know that its no longer true
So were coming out of the kitchen
Cause theres something we forgot to say to you  we say 
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
Mothers daughters and their daughters too yeah
Woman to woman
Were singing with you
The inferior sex got a new exterior  yeah 
We got doctors lawyers politicians too  oo
Everybody take a look around
Can you see Can you see Can you see
Theres a woman right next to you
Sisters are doing it for themselves  oh yes we are 
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Now we aint making stories
And we aint laying plans
Cause a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man
Just the same though 


Sisters are doing it for themselves
There was a time
When they used to say
That behind every great man
There had to be a great woman
But in these times of change
You know that its no longer true
So were coming out of the kitchen
Cause theres something we forgot to say to you  we say 
Sister are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Sisters are doing it for themselves  yeah yeah 
Sisters are doing it doing it for themselves  doing it doing it 
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Sister are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Sister are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves
Thank you Ill get it myself
