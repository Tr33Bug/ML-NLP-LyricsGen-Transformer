Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Somebody told me
Something about you
I didnt believe it
I couldnt believe it
Im still reeling
Cause I just cant take the blow
Well theres laughter and love
And theres a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well theres laughter and love
And theres a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Full of forgiveness
Youre just twisted
Im a silly little saint
With a halo of smiles
But it makes no difference
Well theres laughter and love
And theres a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well theres laughter and love
And theres a lot of pain
I never wanna see your
Pretty face again
Well well well well
Well well well well
Well well well well
Well  Well  well  Well  well  Well  well
