Sweet Dreams  Are Made of This   Hot Remix  LyricsSweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybodys looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Ooh  Hey hey
Ooh  Ahhaoh
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
I travel the world and the seven seas
Everybodys looking for something
Ooh  Ha ha
Ooh  Oh oh oh oh oh
Hold your head up
Keep your head up  Movin on 
Hold your head up  Movin on 
Keep your head up  Groovin on 
Hold your head up  Movin on

Hold your head up  Movin on

Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
