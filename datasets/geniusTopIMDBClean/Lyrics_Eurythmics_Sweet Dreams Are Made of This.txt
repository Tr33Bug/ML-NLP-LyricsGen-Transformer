TranslationsSweet Dreams  Are Made of This  Lyrics
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
Hold your head up
Keep your head up movin on
Hold your head up movin on
Keep your head up movin on
Hold your head up movin on
Keep your head up movin on
Hold your head up movin on
Keep your head up
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree
Ive traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybodys lookin for something
