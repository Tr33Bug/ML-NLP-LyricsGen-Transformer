I could be contended
I dont need to suffer
Youre beautiful
Good to talk to
You make an impression
To take my attention
And when you touch my skin
I smell disaster
Step away  walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away  walk away
Nothing but the real thing 
Step away  walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away  walk away
It should be me and you 
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
Walking on pavements
We collect in bars
Asleep in the houses
So alone
Looking inside herself
She breaks the glass
Turns her head backwards
Shes fallen down again
Step away  walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away  walk away
Nothing but the real thing it should be me and you 
Step away  walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away  walk away
Nothing but the real thing it should be me and you 
Lets just close our eyes
Lets just close our eyes
Lets just close our eyes
Lets just close our eyes
Lets just close our eyes
Lets just close our eyes
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
I just forget myself
Lets just close our eyes
