There Must Be an Angel  Playing with My Heart  Lyrics
Noone on earth could feel like this
Im thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an angel
Playing with my heart
I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
Its an orchestra of angels
And theyre playing with my heart
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Noone on earth could feel like this
Im thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an angel
Playing with my heart
And when I think that Im alone
It seems theres more of us at home
Its a multitude of angels
And theyre playing with my heart
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
I must be hallucinating
Watching angels celebrating
Could this be reactivating
All my senses dislocating
This must be a strange deception
By celestial intervention
Leavin me the recollection
Of your heavenly connection


I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
Its an orchestra of angels
And theyre playing with my heart
