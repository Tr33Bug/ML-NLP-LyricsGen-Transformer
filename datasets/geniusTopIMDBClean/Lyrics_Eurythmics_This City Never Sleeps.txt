You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder
You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder
You know theres so many people
Living in this house
And dont even know their names
You know theres so many people
Living in this house
And dont even know their names
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder
You can hear the sound
Of the underground trains
You know it feels like distant thunder
Walls so thin I can almost
Hear them breathing
And if I listen in
I feel my own heart beating
Walls so thin I can almost
Hear them breathing
And if I listen in
I feel my own heart beating
In the city
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city 
I guess its just a feeling
I guess its just a feeling  In the city
