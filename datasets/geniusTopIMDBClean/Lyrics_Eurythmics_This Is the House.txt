This Is the House Lyrics
Esta es la casa
Este es el cerro
Esta la historia
Es algo chiquitito

This is the house
This is the hill
This is the story
It's a little thing
A lock of hair
An invisible smoke trail
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh, oh, oh, everything changes
This is your picture
It's in black and white
This is the family
Having a party
There's a crack in the ceiling
And there's an open door
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh, oh, oh, everything changes

Oh, oh, oh
Esta es la casa
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Esta la historia
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Es algo chiquitito
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This is the house
This is the hill
This is the story
It's a little thing
A lock of hair
An invisible smoke trail
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh, oh, oh, everything changes
You might also like
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This is the houseEmbed
