Esta es la casa
Este es el cerro
Esta la historia
Es algo chiquitito
This is the house
This is the hill
This is the story
Its a little thing
A lock of hair
An invisible smoke trail
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh oh oh everything changes
This is your picture
Its in black and white
This is the family
Having a party
Theres a crack in the ceiling
And theres an open door
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh oh oh everything changes
Oh oh oh
Esta es la casa
Oh oh oh oh
Esta la historia
Oh oh oh oh
Es algo chiquitito
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is the house
This is the hill
This is the story
Its a little thing
A lock of hair
An invisible smoke trail
Nothing there but the dust and the rust
Oh oh oh everything changes
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is the house
