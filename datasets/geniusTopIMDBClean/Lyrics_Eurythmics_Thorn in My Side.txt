Yeah
You gave me such a bad time
Tried to hurt me but now I know
Thorn in my side
You know thats all you ever were
A bundle of lies
You know thats all that it was worth
I should have known better
But I trusted you at first
I should have known better
But I got what I deserved

Now every time I think of you
