Whos that girl
The language of love slips from my lovers tongue
Cooler than ice cream and warmer than the sun
Dumb hearts get broken just like china cups
The language of love has left me broken on the rocks
But theres just one thing  Ah 
Just one thing  Hey 
But theres just one thing  Oh yeah 
And I really wanna know
Whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl
The language of love has left me stony grey
Tongue tied and twisted at the price Ive had to pay
Your careless notions have silenced these emotions
Look at all the foolishness your lovers talk has done
Whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl
But theres just one thing  Ah 
Just one thing  Hey 
But theres just one thing
Ooh oohooh
Tell me
Tell me whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl running around with you
Tell me whos that girl running around with you
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
