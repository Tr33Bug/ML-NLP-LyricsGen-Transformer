Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shines out through the night
Two hearts athrilling in spite of the chilling weather
Love knows no season love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open were walking and hoping together
Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight were having tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
Hell say Are you married  Well say No maam
But you can do the job when youre in town
Later on well conspire as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Scoo dee uh dee doo dee duh
Da doo da doo da  Da doo da doo da yeah
Oh yeah
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that hes a circus clown
Well have lots of fun with Mr Snowman
Until the other kiddies come around
When it snows aint it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
Well frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland  Let those sleigh bells ring
Walking in a winter wonderland  Tell it like it is
Walking in a winter wonderland 
Were slipping and sliding out here here we go
Walking in a winter wonderland  In the cold cold snow
Yeah yeah   Walking in a winter wonderland 
Its wintertime its wintertime yeah
Walking in a winter wonderland  Wont you come down with me
Walking in a winter wonderland  Slipping and sliding
Slipping and sliding slipping and sliding slipping and sliding
Walking in a winter wonderland  slipping and sliding slipping and sliding
Would you go  Would you go
Walking in a winter wonderland  Would you go  Would you go
Would you go  Would you go  Would you go  Would you go
Would you go  Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Walking in a winter wonderland  Come on down come on down
Walking in a winter wonderland  come on down come on down come on down come on down
Walking in a winter wonderland  come on down down down down down down down
