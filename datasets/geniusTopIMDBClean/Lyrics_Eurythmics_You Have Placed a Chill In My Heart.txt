You have placed a chill in my heart
You have placed a chill in my heart
Take me to the desert where theres got to be
A whole heap of nothing for you and me
Take me to the desert take me to the sand
Show me the color of your right hand
You have placed a chill in my heart
You have placed a chill in my heart
Love is a temple love is a shrine
Buy some love at the five and dime
A little bit of love from the counter store
Get it on credit if you need some more
Ill be the figure of your disgrace
A crisscross pattern upon your face
A womans just too tired to think
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink
I wish I was invisible so I could climb through the telephone
When it hurts my ear and it hurts my brain
And it makes me feel too much
Too much too much too much
Dont cut me down when Im talking to you
Cause Im much too tall to feel that small
Love is a temple love is a shrine
Love is pure and love is blind
Love is a religious sign
Im gonna leave this love behind
Love is hot and love is cold
Ive been bought and Ive been sold
Love is rock and love is roll
I just want someone to hold


Hold me now
Hold me now baby
Come on
Yeah
You have placed a chill in my heart
Make me feel come on now 
You have placed a chill in my heart
Ooh yeah yeah yeah 
You have placed a chill in my heart
Ah yeah yeah yeah Whoo 
You have placed a chill in my heart
Gimme two times gimme two times 
Gimme two times gimme two times 
Gimme two times yeah
