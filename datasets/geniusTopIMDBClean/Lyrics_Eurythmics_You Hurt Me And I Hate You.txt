You Hurt Me (And I Hate You) Lyrics
Well, the sun came up this morning
Like a burning red balloon
It broke into my window
And it slipped across the room
It spread itself upon me
Like the smell of sweet perfume
I was sleeping like a baby

I'm not a saviour
I'm not a saint
I'm not an angel
I'm not that quaint
Don't need a preacher
To be that wise
Don't need a teacher –
I've got my eyes...
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me

A history of bitterness
You have left a blazing trail
If you had been a hammer
I'd be a broken nail
You gave me nothing –
Nothing but regrets
Don't think it's over –
It's not over yet

You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
You hurt me, I hate you
You hurt me
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me...
You put me down, you put me down
You might also like
They say there's no Hell on Earth
That's like a woman scorned
And if you have to face this Hell
You'll wish you'd not been born
And if you have to face this Hell
You'll find me standing there
In the shadows, in the corners
At the foot of every stair

You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down

You hurt me, I hate you
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me and I hate you
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me, I hate you
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me, I hate you
You put me down, you put me down
You hurt me...
You put me down, you put me downEmbed
