You Hurt Me  And I Hate You  Lyrics
Well the sun came up this morning
Like a burning red balloon
It broke into my window
And it slipped across the room
It spread itself upon me
Like the smell of sweet perfume
I was sleeping like a baby
Im not a saviour
Im not a saint
Im not an angel
Im not that quaint
Dont need a preacher
To be that wise
Dont need a teacher 
Ive got my eyes
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
A history of bitterness
You have left a blazing trail
If you had been a hammer
Id be a broken nail
You gave me nothing 
Nothing but regrets
Dont think its over 
Its not over yet
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
You hurt me I hate you
You hurt me
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me and I hate you
You hurt me
You put me down you put me down


They say theres no Hell on Earth
Thats like a woman scorned
And if you have to face this Hell
Youll wish youd not been born
And if you have to face this Hell
Youll find me standing there
In the shadows in the corners
At the foot of every stair
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You put me down
You hurt me I hate you
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me and I hate you
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me I hate you
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me I hate you
You put me down you put me down
You hurt me
You put me down you put me down
