Sometimes the most beautiful things
The most innocent things
And many of those dreams pass us by
Keep passing me by
You feel good
I said its funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good you were very very good
So I close my eyes softly
Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime yeah
And to those that I love like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams
You said  You feel good
I said its funny that you understood
I knew you would
When you were good baby
You were very good
I still look up when you walk in the room
Ive the same wide eyes now they tell the story
I try not to reach out when you turn round you say hello
And we both pretend
Im no great pretender
So I close my eyes softly
Til I become that part of the wind
That we all long for sometime yeah
And to those that I love like a ghost through a fog
Like a charmed hour and a haunted song
And the angel angel of my dreams
Angel of my dreams
I still look up yeah
I try hard not to look up yeah
That girl was me yeah
Track a ghost through the fog yeah
A charmed hour and a haunted song yeah
Track a ghost through the fog baby yeah
Track a ghost through the fog baby
Ooh you try hard
But youll never catch me yeah
That girl was me
Ooh you try hard
But youll never catch me yeah
Ooh that girl was me
