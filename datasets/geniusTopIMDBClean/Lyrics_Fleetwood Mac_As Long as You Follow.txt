Ive been searching
For a pot of gold
Like the kind you find
At the end of the rainbow
Ive been dreaming
I thought it was in vain
Ah but now youre here
Cant believe that youre back again
Now I know I cant lose
As long as you follow
Im going to win
Im going to win 
Im going to beg steal or borrow
As long as you follow
Ive been wandering
Gone away too far
But the road was rough
To get back where you are
And the sun went down
It never seemed to rise
Ah but now youre here
With the light shining in your eyes
As long as you follow 
As long as you follow
As long as you follow 
As long as you follow
