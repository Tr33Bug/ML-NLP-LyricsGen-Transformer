Beautiful Child LyricsBeautiful child
Beautiful child
You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more
You fell in love when I was only ten
The years disappeared
Much has gone by since then
I bite my lip, can you send me away
You touch
I have no choice
I have to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
Well, I wish that you were mine
I wish that you were mine
You say it will be harder in the morning
I wait for you to say, just go
Your hands, held mine so few hours
(I fell into love)
But I'm not a child anymore
I'm not a child anymore
I'm tall enough
To reach for the stars
I'm old enough
To love you from afar
Too trusting, yes
But then women usually are
(I'm not a child anymore)
I'm not a child, oh no
(I'm tall enough to reach for the stars)
I will do as I'm told
(I'm old enough to love you from afar)
Even if I never hold you again
(Too trusting yes, but then women usually are)
Hold you again
(Hold you again)

There is so little time
(I will do as I am told)
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
(Even if I never hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Even if I never hold you again)
Well I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
Well I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
(I'm not a child anymore)2Embed
