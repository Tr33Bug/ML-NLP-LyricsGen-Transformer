Beautiful child
Beautiful child
You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more
You fell in love when I was only ten
The years disappeared
Much has gone by since then
I bite my lip can you send me away
You touch
I have no choice
I have to stay
Ooh I had to stay
Ooh I had to stay
Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes
But you dont say yes
Well I wish that you were mine
I wish that you were mine
You say it will be harder in the morning
I wait for you to say just go
Your hands held mine so few hours
I fell into love 
But Im not a child anymore
Im not a child anymore
Im tall enough
To reach for the stars
Im old enough
To love you from afar
Too trusting yes
But then women usually are
Im not a child anymore 
Im not a child oh no
Im tall enough to reach for the stars 
I will do as Im told
Im old enough to love you from afar 
Even if I never hold you again
Too trusting yes but then women usually are 
Hold you again
Hold you again 
Sleepless child
There is so little time
I will do as I am told 
Your eyes say yes
But you dont say yes
Even if I never hold you again 
I wish that you were mine
Hold you again 
I wish that you were mine
Even if I never hold you again 
Well I wish that you were mine
Hold you again 
Well I wish that you were mine
Hold you again 
Im not a child anymore
