Black Magic Woman Lyrics
Got a black magic woman
I got a black magic woman
Yes, I got a black magic woman
She's got me so blind I can't see
But she's a black magic woman
And she's trying to make a Devil out of me

Don't turn your back on me baby
Don't turn your back on me baby
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby
You're messing around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me baby
Because you might just break up my magic stick
You got your spell on me baby
You got your spell on me baby
Yes, you got your spell on me baby
You're turning my heart into stone
I need you so bad, magic woman
I can't leave you alone

Yes, I need you so bad
Well, I need you darling
Yeah, I need you darling
Yes, I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Whoa, I want you to love me, ah
Whoh, yeah
Oh, whoa, baby
Yes, I need your love
Oh, I need your love so bad
Yes, I want you to love meYou might also like3Embed
