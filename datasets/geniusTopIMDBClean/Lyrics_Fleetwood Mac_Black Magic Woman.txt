Got a black magic woman
I got a black magic woman
Yes I got a black magic woman
Shes got me so blind I cant see
But shes a black magic woman
And shes trying to make a Devil out of me
Dont turn your back on me baby
Dont turn your back on me baby
Yes dont turn your back on me baby
Youre messing around with your tricks
Dont turn your back on me baby
Because you might just break up my magic stick
You got your spell on me baby
You got your spell on me baby
Yes you got your spell on me baby
Youre turning my heart into stone
I need you so bad magic woman
I cant leave you alone
Yes I need you so bad
Well I need you darling

Yes I want you to love me
I want you to love me
Whoa I want you to love me ah

Oh whoa baby
Yes I need your love
Oh I need your love so bad
Yes I want you to love me
