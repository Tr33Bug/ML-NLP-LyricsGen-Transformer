It was a blue letter she wrote to me
Its silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who dont get old
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I wont be waiting around for you
For every voice youve ever heard
Theres a thousand without a word
Redbird dont say you told me so
Give me one more song to go
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I wont be waiting around for you
For every voice youve ever heard
Theres a thousand without a word
Redbird dont say you told me so
Give me one more song to go
Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I wont be waiting around for you
I aint waiting
