Blue Letter Lyrics
It was a blue letter she wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I want a lover who don't get old

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you
For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you


For every voice you've ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so
Give me one more song to go

Do I read a message in your eyes
You want a love to stay another night
Baby, when your day goes down
I won't be waiting around for you
