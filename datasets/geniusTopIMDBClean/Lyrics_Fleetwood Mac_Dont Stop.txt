If you wake up and dont wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
Youll see things in a different way
Dont stop thinking about tomorrow
Dont stop itll soon be here
Itll be better than before
Yesterdays gone yesterdays gone
Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that youve done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do
Dont stop thinking about tomorrow
Dont stop itll soon be here
Itll be better than before
Yesterdays gone yesterdays gone
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you dont believe that its true
I never meant any harm to you
Dont stop thinking about tomorrow
Dont stop itll soon be here
Itll be better than before
Yesterdays gone yesterdays gone
Dont stop thinking about tomorrow
Dont stop itll soon be here
Itll be better than before
Yesterdays gone yesterdays gone


Ooh dont you look back
Ooh dont you look back
Ooh dont you look back
Ooh dont you look back
