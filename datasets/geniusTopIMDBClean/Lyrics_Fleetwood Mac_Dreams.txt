Now here you go again you say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
Its only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost
Oh thunder only happens when its raining
Players only love you when theyre playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean youll know
Youll know
Now here I go again I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
Its only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams youd like to sell
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh what you lost
Thunder only happens when its raining
Players only love you when theyre playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean youll know
Oh thunder only happens when its raining
Players only love you when theyre playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean youll know
Youll know
You will know
Oh youll know
