Calling out your name
Calling out your name
Can you hear me calling
Out your name
You know that Im falling
And I dont know what to say
Ill speak a little louder
Ill even shout
You know that Im proud
And I cant get the words out
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
I wanna be with you everywhere 
Somethings happening
Happening to me
My friends say Im acting peculiarly
Come along baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
I wanna be with you everywhere 
Can you hear me calling
Out your name
You know that Im falling
And I dont know what to say
Come along baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
I wanna be with you everywhere
