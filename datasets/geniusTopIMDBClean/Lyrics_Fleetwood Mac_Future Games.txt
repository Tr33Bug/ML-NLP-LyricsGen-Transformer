I did a thing last night
You know those future games
I turned off all the lights
Oh the future came
You were by my side
Will you explainoh yeah
Real rhyme or reason for those future games
Now you were there last night
And oh were you afraid
Of things wed come upon
While playing future games
But baby its alright and so have faith
Oh yeah you invent the future that you want to face
How many people sit home at night
Wondering if they will be here tonight
Wondering if children will he bring to the light
Inherit the world or inherit the night
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain
Well I know Im not the only one
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games
You better take your time
You know theres no escape
The future sends a sign
Of things we will create
Baby its alright
And so have faith
Future games
I know Im not the only one
