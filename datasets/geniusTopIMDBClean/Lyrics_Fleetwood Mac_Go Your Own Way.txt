Loving you isnt the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel
If I could maybe Id give you my world
How can I when you wont take it from me
You can go your own way go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way go your own way
Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up shacking ups all you wanna do
If I could baby Id give you my world
Open up everythings waiting for you
You can go your own way go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way go your own way
You can go your own way go your own way
You can call it another lonely day another lonely day
You can go your own way go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way
