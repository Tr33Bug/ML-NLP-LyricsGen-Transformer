Can you understand me
Baby dont you hand me a line
Although it doesnt matter
You and me got plenty of time
Theres nobody in the future
So baby let me hand you my love
Oh theres no step for you to dance to
So slip your hand inside of my glove
Hold me hold me hold me
Come on and  Hold me hold me hold me
I dont want no damage
But howm I going to manage you
Oh you want a percentage
But Im the fool payin the dues
Oh Ima just around the corner
If you got a minute to spare
Ill be waitin for you
If you ever wanna be there
Hold me hold me hold me
Come on and  Hold me hold me hold me
Why wont you  Hold me hold me hold me
Come on and  Hold me hold me hold me
Come on and  Hold me hold me hold me
Come on and  Hold me hold me hold me
Come on and  Hold me hold me hold me
Come on and  Hold me hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
