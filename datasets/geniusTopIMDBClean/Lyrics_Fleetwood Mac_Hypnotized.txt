Its the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide at least half of a playing field
Because theres no explaining
What your imagination can make you see and feel
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Now its not a meaningless question
To ask if theyve been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any mans hand ever made that land
Then I think it wouldve showed
Thats why it seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
I know thats right
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
They say theres a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he dont need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know its a meaningless question to ask
If those stories are right
Because what matters most
Is the feeling you get when youre hypnotized


Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Yeaaaaahhhh thats when thats when they got you hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
