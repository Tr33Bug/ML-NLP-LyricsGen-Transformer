Hypnotized Lyrics
It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining
What your imagination can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

That's why it seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
I know that's right


Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question to ask
If those stories are right
Because what matters most
Is the feeling you get when you're hypnotized
You might also like
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Yeaaaaahhhh, that's when, that's when they got you hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized3Embed
