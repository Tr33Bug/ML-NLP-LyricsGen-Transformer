I dont want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I dont want to stand between you and love
Honey I just want you to feel fine
I dont want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I dont want to stand between you and love
Honey I just want you to feel fine
Finally baby
The truth has come down now
Take a listen to your spirit
Its crying out loud
Trying to believe
Oh you say you love me but you dont know
You got me rocking and areeling
Oh oh yeah uh huh
I dont want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I dont want to stand between you and love
Honey I just want you to feel fine
I dont want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I dont want to stand between you and love
Honey I just want you to feel fine
Finally baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me that Im crazy
Its nothing that I didnt know
Trying to survive
Oh you say you love me but you dont know
You got me rocking and areeling
Hanging on to you
Oh oh yeah uh huh
I dont want to know the reasons why love keeps
Right on walking on down the line
I dont want to stand between you and love honey
Take a little time
Ah I dont want to know
