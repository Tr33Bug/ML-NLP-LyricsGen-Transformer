Ive been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears
I never change
I never will
Im so afraid the way I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agonys torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die
I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around
I never change
I never will
Im so afraid the way I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agonys torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die
How I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agonys torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die
