I took my love took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snowcovered hills
Til the landslide brought me down
Oh mirror in the sky what is love
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life
Hmmhmm hmmhmm
Well Ive been afraid of changing
Cause Ive built my life around you
But time makes you bolder even children get older
And Im getting older too
Well Ive been afraid of changing
Cause Ive built my life around you
But time makes you bolder even children get older
And Im getting older too
Oh Im getting older too
I take my love take it down
Ah climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
Well the landslide will bring you down
And If you see my reflection in the snowcovered hills
Well the landslide will bring you down
Oh the landslide will bring it down
