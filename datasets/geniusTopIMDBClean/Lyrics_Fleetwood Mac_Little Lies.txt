If I could turn the page
In time then Id rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my close my close my eyes
But I couldnt find a way
So Ill settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me tell me tell me lies
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me tell me lies 
Oh no no you cant disguise
You cant disguise no you cant disguise 
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Although Im not making plans
I hope that you understand
Theres a reason why
Close your close your close your eyes
No more broken hearts
Were better off apart
Lets give it a try
Tell me tell me tell me lies
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me tell me lies 
Oh no no you cant disguise
You cant disguise no you cant disguise 
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Bridge
If I could turn the page
In time then Id rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my close my close my eyes 
But I couldnt find a way
So Ill settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me tell me tell me lies 
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me tell me lies 
Oh no no you cant disguise
You cant disguise oh you cant disguise 
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me lies tell me tell me lies 
Oh no no you cant disguise
You cant disguise no you cant disguise 
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
Tell me tell me lies
