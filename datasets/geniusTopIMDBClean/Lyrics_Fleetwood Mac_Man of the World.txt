Shall I tell you about my life
They say Im a man of the world
Ive flown across every tide
And Ive seen lots of pretty girls
I guess Ive got everything I need
I wouldnt ask for more
And theres no one Id rather be
But I just wish that Id never been born
And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I dont say Im a good man
Oh but I would be if I could
I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused Im sure
About all the times Ive cried
And how I dont want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in love
