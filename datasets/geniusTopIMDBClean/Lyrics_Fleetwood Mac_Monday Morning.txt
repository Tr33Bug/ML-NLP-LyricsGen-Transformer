Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelin on my mind
First you love me and then you fade away
I cant go on believing this way
I got nothing but love for you
Tell me what you really want to do
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I dont mind
I dont mind yeah
Ill be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
Monday morning you sure look fine
Friday I got travelin on my mind
First you love me and then you say its wrong
You know I cant go on believing for long
But you know its true  Yes 
You only want me when I get over you
First you love me then you get on down the line
But I dont mind
No I dont mind yeah
Ill be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
But you know its true
You know you only want me when I get over you
Oh first you love me then you get on down the line


But I dont mind
No I dont mind yeah
Ill be there if you want me to
No one else that could ever do
Got to get some peace in my mind
