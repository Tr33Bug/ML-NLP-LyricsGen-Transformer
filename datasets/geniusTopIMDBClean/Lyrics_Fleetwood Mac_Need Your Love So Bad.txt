Need someones hand to lead me through the night
I need someones arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now when the night begins whoa Im at an end
Because I need your love so bad
I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up  to stand up and tell me when Im lyin
And when the lights are low  and its time to go
Thats when I need your love so bad
So why dont you give it up baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper woman  so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me  and stop drivin me mad
Whoa because I  I need your love so bad
Need a soft voice  just to talk to me at night
Dont want you to worry baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea baby come on bring it to me
Cause I need  your love so bad
Baby I need I need  woman I need your love so bad
