Oh Daddy Lyrics
Oh, Daddy, you know you make me cry
How can you love me, I don't understand why
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

Oh, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
Why are you right when I'm so wrong? (So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried


Why are you right when I'm so wrong? (So wrong)
I'm so weak but you're so strong (Never so strong)
Everything you do is just all right
And I can't walk away from you, baby, if I tried

Oh, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know you're the best thing in my life
Oh, Daddy, if I can make you see
If there's been a fool around, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be meYou might also like2Embed
