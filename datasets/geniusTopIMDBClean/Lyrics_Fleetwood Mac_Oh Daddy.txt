Oh Daddy you know you make me cry
How can you love me I dont understand why
Oh Daddy if I can make you see
If theres been a fool around its got to be me
Yes its got to be me
Oh Daddy you soothe me with your smile
Youre letting me know youre the best thing in my life
Oh Daddy if I can make you see
If theres been a fool around its got to be me
Yes its got to be me
Why are you right when Im so wrong  So wrong 
Im so weak but youre so strong  Never so strong 
Everything you do is just all right
And I cant walk away from you baby if I tried
Why are you right when Im so wrong  So wrong 
Im so weak but youre so strong  Never so strong 
Everything you do is just all right
And I cant walk away from you baby if I tried
Oh Daddy you soothe me with your smile
Youre letting me know youre the best thing in my life
Oh Daddy if I can make you see
If theres been a fool around its got to be me
Yes its got to be me
Yes its got to be me
Yes its got to be me
