Cant help about the shape Im in
I cant sing I aint pretty and my legs are thin
But dont ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh well
Now when I talk to God
I know he understands
He said stick by me and Ill be your guiding hand
But dont ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh well
