Oh Well  Part 1  Lyrics
I cant help about the shape Im in
I cant sing I aint pretty and my legs are thin
But dont ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Oh well
Now when I talked to God I knew hed understand
He said Stick by me and Ill be your guiding hand
But dont ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to
Well
Oh well oh well
Well well well well
