Intro
You can take me to the paradise
And then again you can be cold as ice
Im over my head  Over my head 
Oh but it sure feels nice
You can take me anytime you like
Ill be around if you think you might
Love me baby  Over my head 
And hold me tight
Your mood is like a circus wheel
Youre changing all the time
Sometimes I cant help but feel
That Im wasting all of my time
Instrumental
Your mood is like a circus wheel
Youre changing all the time
Sometimes I cant help but feel
That Im wasting all of my time
I think Im looking on the dark side
But every day you hurt my pride
Im over my head  Over my head 
Oh but it sure feels nice
Im over my head  Over my head 
But it sure feels nice
Im over my head  Over my head 
But it sure feels nice
