Planets of the Universe  Early Demo  LyricsAnd the planets of the universe go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon or by the day
You and I will simply disappear out of sight
But Im afraid soon therell be no light
I will never love again the way I loved you
You will never rule again the way youve ruled
We will never change again the way we are changing
Oh youll forget the chill of love but not the strain
Oh youll forget the chill of love but not the strain
You will remember but I will die slowly
Its only an overture to something that was best
And dont dont condescend me
Take your leave
Take your leave
Take your leave of me now
Disappear through the year
I wish you gone and I dont care
Now I know
Well I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream
Oh I would never dream
