Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldnt you love to love her
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover
All your life youve never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no Rhiannon you cry but shes gone
Your life knows no answer your life knows no answer
All your life youve never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win
Will you ever win
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldnt you love to love her
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover
All your life youve never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win
Will you ever win
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Taken by taken by the sky
Taken by taken by the sky
Taken by taken by the sky
Dreams unwind
Loves a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Loves a state of mind
