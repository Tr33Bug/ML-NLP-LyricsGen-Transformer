Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said youd give me light
But you never told me bout the fire
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now its gone
It doesnt matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home
And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces
Said Sara youre the poet in my heart
Never change never stop
But now its gone
It doesnt matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home
Hold on the night is coming
And the starling flew for days
Id stay home at night all the time
Id go anywhere anywhere anywhere
Ask me and Im there yeah
Ask me and Im there cause I care
In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now its gone
They say it doesnt matter anymore
Oh if you build your house
Then please call me home
Sara youre the poet in my heart
Never change and dont you ever stop
And now its gone
No it doesnt matter anymore
When you build your house
Ill come by
Sara
Sara
Theres a heartbeat that never really died
Heartbeat that never really died  Sara 
Oh wont you swallow your pride
All I ever wanted was to know that you were dreaming
