Have mercy baby on a poor girl like me
You know Im falling falling falling at your feet
Im tingling right from my head to my toes
So help me help me help me make the feeling go
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down
And theres not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Have pity baby just when I thought it was over
Now you got me running running running for cover
Im begging you for a little sympathy
And if you use me again itll be the end of me
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down
And theres not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Instrumental Break
Baby baby hope youre gonna stay away
Cause Im getting weaker weaker everyday
I guess Im not as strong as I used to be
And if you use me again itll be the end of me
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down
And theres not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down
And theres not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up
And you say that you love me
Say that you love me
Say that you love me


Falling falling falling
Falling falling falling  Yeah 
Falling falling falling
Falling falling falling
Falling falling falling
Falling falling falling
