Something in you brought out something in me
That Ive never been since
That part of me that was only for you
That kind of romance
Comes only once that kind of love
That kind of fever dance
That you love because you become someone else in an instant
Say you will say you will give me one more chance
At least give me time to change your mind
That always seems to heal the wounds
If I can get you to dance
Something in you put a hold on my heart
Its hard to believe now
Here in the place that will never be dark
I remember that place
That kind of touch electricity of love
That certain kind of grace
That you love because you become someone else in an instant
