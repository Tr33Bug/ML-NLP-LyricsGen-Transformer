Second Hand News Lyrics
I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

I know I got nothing on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad
And you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, doo da doodladoo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, yeah

One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long
I've been tossed around enough
Oh, couldn't you just
Let me go down and do my stuff?

I know you're hoping to find
Someone who's going to give you peace of mind
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, doo da doodladoo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow
Do it do it do it
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow, doo da doodladoo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow bow, bow bow
