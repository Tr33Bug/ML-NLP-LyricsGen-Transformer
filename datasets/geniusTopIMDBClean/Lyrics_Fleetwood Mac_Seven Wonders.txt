So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline
But if our paths never cross
Well you know Im sorry but
If I live to see the seven wonders
Ill make a path to the rainbows end
Ill never live to match the beauty again
The rainbows edge
Aaron 
Aaron 
So its hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me
But if our paths never cross
Well no Im not sorry but
If I live to see the seven wonders
Ill make a path to the rainbows end
Ill never live to match the beauty again
The rainbows edge
Aaron

So long ago
Its a certain time
Its a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh it might work out someday
If I live to see the seven wonders
Ill make a path to the rainbows end
Ill never live to match the beauty again
If I live to see the seven wonders  if I live to see the seven wonders 
Ill make a path to the rainbows end  Ill make a path there 
Ill never live to match the beauty again  Ill never live to see that beauty that beauty that same same beauty again 
If I live to see the seven wonders  if I live to see the 
Ill make a path to the rainbows end
Ill never live to match the beauty again
Well if I hope and I pray 
Well maybe it might work out someday 
If I live to see the seven wonders  if I live to see the seven wonders
