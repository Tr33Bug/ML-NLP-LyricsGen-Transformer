You could be my silver spring
Bluegreen colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing
Dont say that shes pretty
And did you say that she loved you
Baby I dont want to know
So I begin not to love you
Turn around see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me no
And dont say that shes pretty
And did you say that she loved you
Baby I dont want to know
Oh no and can you tell me was it worth it
Baby I dont want to know
Time cast a spell on you
But you wont forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
Time cast a spell on you
But you wont forget me
Well I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me


I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
Youll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
Youll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Time cast a spell on you
But you wont forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
