For you therell be no more crying
For you the sun will be shining
And I feel that when Im with you
Its alright I know its right
To you Ill give the world
To you Ill never be cold
Cause I feel that when Im with you
Its alright I know its right
And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you I love you I love you
Like never before
And I wish you all the love in the world
But most of all I wish it from myself
And the songbirds keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you I love you I love you
Like never before
Like never before
Like never before
