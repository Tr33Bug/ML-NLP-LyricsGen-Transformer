Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every night you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much
Is there anything left to say
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside
I havent felt this way I feel
Since many a year ago
But in those years are the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside
So I try to say goodbye my friend
Id like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm
Always been a storm
Ooh always been a storm
I have always been a storm
We were frail
She said Every night he will break your heart  Storm 
I should have known from the first
Id be the brokenhearted  Storm 
Storm 
I loved you from the start  Storm 
Save us
Storm  And not all the prayers in the world will save us
