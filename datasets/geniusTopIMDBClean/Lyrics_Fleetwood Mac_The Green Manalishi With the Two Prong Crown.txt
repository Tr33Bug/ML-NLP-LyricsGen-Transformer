The Green Manalishi  With the Two Prong Crown  LyricsNow when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
The night is so black that the darkness cooks
Dont you come creepin around
Makin me do things I dont wanna do
Cant believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneakin around tryin to drive me mad
Bustin in on my dreams
Makin me see things I dont wanna see
Cause youre da Green Manalishi with the two prong crown
All my tryin is up all your bringin is down
Just takin my love then slippin away
Leavin me here just tryin to keep from followin you
