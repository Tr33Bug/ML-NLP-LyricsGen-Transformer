All it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
I didnt mean to love you
Didnt think it would work out
But I knew we would be together
And I couldnt wait for more
What can they say
Its not against the law
I dont hold you down
And maybe thats why youre around
But if Im the one you love
Think about me
I believe that you really want me
But its not easy just to give in
So let yourself go
And let love begin
I dont hold you down
And maybe thats why youre around
But if Im the one you love
Think about me
I dont hold you down
And maybe thats why youre around
But if Im the one you love
Think about me
Baby once in a while
Think about me
Baby once in a while
Think about me
Think about me
Every every once in a while
Think about me
