Sleep easy by my side
Into gentle slumber you can hide
I Im waiting for the sun to come up
I cant sleep with your warm ways
Forever forever love
Together together love
You made me a woman tonight
Dream until the morning light
I Im waiting for the sun to come up
I cant sleep with your warm ways
Forever forever love
Together together love
