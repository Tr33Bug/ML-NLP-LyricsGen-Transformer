Sweet wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh can it be so
This feeling follows me wherever I go
I never did believe in miracles
But Ive a feeling its time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But Im beginning to wonder why
I never did believe in miracles
But Ive a feeling its time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But Im beginning to wonder why
Dont dont break the spell
It would be different and you know it will
You you make loving fun
And I dont have to tell you but youre the only one
You you make loving fun  Its all I want to do 
You you make loving fun  Its all I want to do 
You you make loving fun  Its all I want to do 
You you make loving fun  Its all I want to do
