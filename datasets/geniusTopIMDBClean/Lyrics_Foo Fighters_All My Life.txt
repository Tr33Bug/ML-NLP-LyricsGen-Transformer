All my life Ive been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but Im getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around then its taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Come down dont you resist
Youve such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve
Hey dont let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey dont let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I got nothing to hide
On and on I got nothing to hide
Hey dont let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey dont let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
All my life Ive been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but Im getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around then its taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Then Im done done on to the next one
Done done and Im on to the next one
Done done and Im on to the next one
Done done and Im on to the next one
Done done and Im on to the next one
Done done and Im on to the next one
Done done and Im on to the next one
Done Im done and Im on to the next
Done done on to the next one
Done Im done and Im on to the next one
Done done on to the next one
Done Im done and Im on to the next
Hey dont let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey dont let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Done done on to the next one
Done and Im done and Im on to the next
