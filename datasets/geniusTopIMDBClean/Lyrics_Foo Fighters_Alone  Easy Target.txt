Alone + Easy Target Lyrics
They knew all along
They're not dumb, they were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now, call when I'm done
Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Crazy T.V. dreams might be true
Not what it seems
Food and cavities, chewing words
Tear at the seams
He don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that he should
I don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that I should

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target

Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out
You might also like
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target

Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out3Embed
