They knew all along
Theyre not dumb they were so wrong
Shes not always fun
Hate it now call when Im done
Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
Ill give this keep the good waist
Head is on
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Metronome
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Crazy TV dreams might be true
Not what it seems
Food and cavities chewing words
Tear at the seams
He dont feel so good dont feel bad
Not that he should
I dont feel so good dont feel bad
Not that I should
Head is on
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Metronome
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Head is on
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Metronome
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Did you ever listen
Did you ever listen
Did you ever listen
Get out get out get out
Get out get out get out
Get out get out get out
Get out get out
Head is on
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Metronome
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Head is on
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Metronome
I want out
Im alone and Im an easy target
Did you ever listen
Did you ever listen
Did you ever listen
Get out get out get out
Get out get out get out
Get out get out get out
Get out get out
