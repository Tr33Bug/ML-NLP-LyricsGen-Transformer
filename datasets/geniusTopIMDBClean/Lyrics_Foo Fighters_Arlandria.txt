Aint that the way it always starts
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped you station to station
Hey dont go and turn the other way
Dont say theres nothin more to say
Come on hear me out hush hush settle down
Button up dont make a sound
Shame shame go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldnt save you enough
So Ive been savin it up I started savin it up
And when you said I couldnt give you enough
I started givin you up I started givin you up
You are not me Arlandria Arlandria
You and what army Arlandria Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop
Chase all of those memories away
Save them all for another day
Dont you remember it was rain that drowned you
Wait I wanna see if you can shake
I want to keep all I can take
I feel much better now use me up spit me out
Let me be your handmedown
Fame fame go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldnt save you enough
So Ive been savin it up I started savin it up
And when you said I couldnt give you enough
I started givin you up I started givin you up


You are not me Arlandria Arlandria
You and what army Arlandria Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia Im the same as I was in your arms
My sweet Virginia Im the same as I was in your heart
Shame shame go away come again some other day
Memories keep haunting me help me chase them all away
Hush now settle down buttonup dont make a sound
Close your eyes turn around help me burn this to the ground
Come now take the blame thats okay Ill play the game
I dont care its all the same watch it all go up in flames
Use me up spit me out let me be your handmedown
Fame fame go away come again some other day
You used to say I couldnt save you enough
So Ive been savin it up I started savin it up
And when you said I couldnt give you enough
I started givin you up I started givin you up
You are not me Arlandria Arlandria
You and what army Arlandria Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia oh God you gotta make it stop
