She was a friend of mine lone on a dead end street
Dancing through life on the front lines
She led a quiet life ends they dont always meet
Years passed her by waiting to rise
She had arrows in her eyes fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Arrows in her eyes fear where her heart should be
War in her mind shame in her cries
Arrows in her eyes tears in her arteries
War in her mind shame as she cries
Fire away
Under a silent light screaming biology
Queen Gemini the world in her sights
I want a new life forming inside of me
Blessed and born into this fire
You had arrows in your eyes fear where your heart should be
War in your mind
Arrows in your eyes fear where your heart should be
War in your mind shame in your cries
Arrows in your eyes tears in your arteries
War in your mind shame as you cry
Fire away oh
Arrows in her eyes fear where her heart should be
War in her mind shame in her cries
Arrows in her eyes tears in her arteries
War in her mind shame as she cries
Fire away ohohohohoh
Ohohohoh
