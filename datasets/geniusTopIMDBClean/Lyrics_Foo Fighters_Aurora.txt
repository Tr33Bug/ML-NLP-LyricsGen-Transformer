Aurora Lyrics
You believe there's something else
To relieve your emptiness
And you dream about yourself
And you bleed and breathe the air
And it's on and on and on and on (and on)
I just kind of died for you
You just kind of stared at me
We will always have that chance
We can do this one more time
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
Take me now
We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

You believe there's somewhere else
Where it's easier than this
And you see outside yourself
And you buy the hole you'll fill
And it's on and on and on and on (and on)

Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
Take me now
We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

On and on and on, Aurora, wait for everyone
Wait 'til the last one's done
On and on and on, Aurora, wait for everyone
Wait 'til the last one's done

Take me now
We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
Turn and come back down2Embed
