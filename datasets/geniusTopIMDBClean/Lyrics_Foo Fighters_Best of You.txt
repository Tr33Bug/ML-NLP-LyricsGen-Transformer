Ive got another confession to make
Im your fool
Everyones got their chains to break
Holdin you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Are you gone and on to someone new
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didnt have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I cant choose
I swear Ill never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Has someone taken your faith
Its real the pain you feel
You trust you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you Oh
Oh oh
Oh oh


Has someone taken your faith
Its real the pain you feel
The life the love youd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Ive got another confession my friend
Im no fool
Im getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused
I swear Ill never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you
Has someone taken your faith
Its real the pain you feel
You trust you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best the best the best of you Oh
