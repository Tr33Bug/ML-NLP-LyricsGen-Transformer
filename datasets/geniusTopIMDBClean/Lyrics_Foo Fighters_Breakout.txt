You make me dizzy running circles in my head
One of these days Ill chase you down
Well look whos going crazy now
Were face to face my friend
Better get out
Better get out
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I dont want to look like that
I dont wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I dont want to look like that
I dont wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
You can see this on my face its all for you
The more and more I take I break right through
Therapy still scares me putting me on my back again
I may be crazy little frayed around the ends
One of these days Ill phase you out
Burn it in the blast off burn it in the blast off
Watching me crawl away
Try to get out try to get out
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I dont want to look like that
I dont wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I dont want to look like that
I dont wanna look like that
I dont wanna look like that
Break out
Break out
Break out
Break out
Go go go


You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I dont want to look like that
I dont wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I dont want to look like that
I dont wanna look like that
I dont wanna look like that
I dont wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
Make me break out
Yeah
