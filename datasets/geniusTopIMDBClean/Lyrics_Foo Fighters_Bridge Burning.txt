These are my famous last words
My numbers up bridges will burn
Oh wont you let me twist your faith
Its gettin kinda late and I dont wanna wait no more
Oh may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace passed your test of faith
Another time another place another line upon your face
Another in your way
Down crooked stairs and sideways glances comes the king of second chances
Now throw him in the flame
Whatever keeps you warm at night
Whatever keeps you warm at night 
Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burnin now
Theyre all comin down its all comin round
Youre burnin them down
Its all comin round theyre all comin down
Your bridges are burnin now
Oh let me put you in your place
Love it when you say Im giving everything away oh
Tell me whats in it for me
Tell me now whats in it for me
No ones gettin this for free
So tell me now whats in it for me
Whatever keeps you warm at night
Whatever keeps you warm at night 
Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burnin now
Theyre all comin down its all comin round
Youre burnin them down
Its all comin round theyre all comin down
Your bridges are burnin now


Gather in the ashes everythings thrown away
Gather in the ashes scatter as they blow away
Gather in the ashes everythings thrown away
Gather in the ashes scatter as they blow away
Your bridges are burnin now
Theyre all comin down its all comin round
Youre burnin them down
Its all comin round theyre all comin down
Gather in the ashes 
Your bridges are burnin now  Everythings thrown away 
Theyre all comin down  Gather in the ashes 
Its all comin round  Scatter as they blow away 
Youre burnin them down  Gather in the ashes 
Its all comin round  Everythings thrown away 
Theyre all comin down  Gather in the ashes 
Your bridges are burnin now  Scatter as they blow away
