Seems like only yesterday
Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see no looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Life began to fade into the black
Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore
Desperate meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything was said and done
I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
Still I tried to find my way
Spinning hours into days
Burning like a flame behind my eyes
Drown it out drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner a slave to the disguise
Disappeared the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time to say goodbye
And I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
No reason left me to survive
You saved me the day you came alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive


I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive
Nothing more to give
I can finally live come alive
Your life into me
I can finally breathe come alive
I lay there in the dark
Open my eyes
You saved me the day that you came alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive come alive
Come alive come alive come alive
