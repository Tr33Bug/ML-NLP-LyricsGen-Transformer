You lost your mind I could not go
What little time we spent a penny on the floor
My desperation a spinnin top
Revolving on and on a world that never stops
Is it all mine How could I know
We threw the rind away swallowed all the core
Tried levitation youre not alone
The stars are holding open a door well never close
I have an engine made of gold
Something so beautiful the world will never know
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete they will grow
Is it all mine I cant let go
What little time we spent a penny on the floor
My desperation is this a curse
Til death do us part for better or for worse
I have an engine made of gold
Something so beautiful the world will never know
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete they will grow
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow
Fuck you Darrell
