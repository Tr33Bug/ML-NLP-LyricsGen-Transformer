Oh you know I did it
Its over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waited and I waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline
I was down and I fell I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever cause nothing lasts
Dancing with the bones of my buried past
Never mind theres nothing I could do
Bet your life theres something killing you
Its a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go but have no fear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
Im finished Im getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats this fast
Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure but the pleasures been mine all mine
Never mind theres nothing I could do
Bet your life theres something killing you


Its a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go but have no fear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
Aint no way DOA
Aint no way DOA
Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure but the pleasures been mine all mine
Never mind theres nothing I could do
Bet your life theres something killing you
Its a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go but have no fear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
Its a shame we have to disappear
No ones getting out of here alive
This time
This time
This time
