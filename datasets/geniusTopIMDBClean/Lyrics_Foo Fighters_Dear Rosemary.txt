You got away got away got away from me
Now get away get away get away from me
I couldnt grow just alivin in the shadow
Where do you go when no ones followin you
You ran away ran away it was right on cue
Shall I go on and on and on and on and on and on again
Rosemary youre a part of me
You know you are you are you are
Rosemary youre a part of me
You know you are you are you are
Rosemary please pardon me
Truth aint gonna change the way you lie
Youth aint gonna change the way you die
Dear Rosemary
Dear Rosemary
You got away got away got away with things
You got away got away got away with things
False starts young hearts get shattered
Pick up the pieces comin down around you
You ran away ran away it was right on cue
Can I go on and on and on and on and on and on again
Rosemary youre a part of me
You know you are you are you are
Rosemary youre a part of me
You know you are you are you are
Rosemary please pardon me
Truth aint gonna change the way you lie
Youth aint gonna change the way you die
This was no ordinary life  This was no ordinary life 
This was no ordinary life  This was no ordinary life 
Im here from now on but once Im gone Im gone
Truth aint gonna change the way you lie
Youth aint gonna change the way you die
Dear Rosemary  Dear Rosemary 
Youre a part of me  Youre a part of me 
Dear Rosemary  Dear Rosemary 
Please pardon me  Please pardon me 
Dear Rosemary
You got away got away got away from me
Now get away get away get away from me
