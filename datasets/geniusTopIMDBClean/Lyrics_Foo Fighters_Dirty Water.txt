Dirty Water Lyrics
I've been drinking dirty water
But I've been here before, after all
The witching hour is upon us
You and I can sing haunted songs
In my dreams, I'm climbing ladders
And then I tumble down, rung by rung
And I keep on falling faster
The heart is echoing, on and on, on and on

I feel an earthquake coming on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're the morning after all my storms (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're my sea of poison flowers
Standing in the sun, row by row
I've been drinking dirty water
The taste of sweet revenge, best served cold, all we know

I feel an earthquake coming on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're the morning after all my storms (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky

I feel an earthquake coming on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Dirty water in my blood (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel a moment coming on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Heavy metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're the morning after all my storms (Ah, ah, ah, ah)You might also like5Embed
