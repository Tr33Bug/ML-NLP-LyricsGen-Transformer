Ive been drinking dirty water
But Ive been here before after all
The witching hour is upon us
You and I can sing haunted songs
In my dreams Im climbing ladders
And then I tumble down rung by rung
And I keep on falling faster
The heart is echoing on and on on and on
I feel an earthquake coming on  Ah ah ah ah 
I feel the metal in my bones  Ah ah ah ah 
Cause Im a natural disaster  Ah ah ah ah 
Youre the morning after all my storms  Ah ah ah ah 
Youre my sea of poison flowers
Standing in the sun row by row
Ive been drinking dirty water
The taste of sweet revenge best served cold all we know
I feel an earthquake coming on  Ah ah ah ah 
I feel the metal in my bones  Ah ah ah ah 
Im a natural disaster  Ah ah ah ah 
Youre the morning after all my storms  Ah ah ah ah 
Bleed dirty water breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water breathe dirty sky
I feel an earthquake coming on  Ah ah ah ah 
I feel the metal in my bones  Ah ah ah ah 
Cause Im a natural disaster  Ah ah ah ah 
Dirty water in my blood  Ah ah ah ah 
I feel a moment coming on  Ah ah ah ah 
Heavy metal in my bones  Ah ah ah ah 
Cause Im a natural disaster  Ah ah ah ah 
Youre the morning after all my storms  Ah ah ah ah
