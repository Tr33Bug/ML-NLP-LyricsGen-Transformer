Hello Ive waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head she sang
Come down and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
Im over my head
Out of her head she sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing Ill ever ask of you
Youve got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Breathe out so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know youve always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing Ill ever ask of you
Youve got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing Ill ever ask of you
Youve got to promise not to stop when I say when
