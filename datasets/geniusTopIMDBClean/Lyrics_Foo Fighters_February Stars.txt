Im hanging on
Here until Im gone
Right where I belong
Just hanging on
Even though
I watched you come and go
How was I to know
Youd steal the show
One day
Ill have enough to gamble
Ill wait to hear your final call
And bet it all
Im hanging on
Here until Im gone
Right where I belong
Just hanging on
Even though
I pass this time alone
Somewhere so unknown
It heals the soul
You ask for walls Ill build them higher
Well lie in the shadows of them all
Id stand but theyre much too tall
And I fall
February stars
Floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars
Floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars
Floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
