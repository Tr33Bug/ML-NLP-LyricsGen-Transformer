He needs a quiet room
With a lock to keep him in
Its just a quiet room
And hes there
He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar
That he played
Hes never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He says Nevermind
And no one speaks
He thinks he drinks too much
Cause when he tells his two best friends
I think I drink too much
No one speaks
No one speaks
No one speaks
He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar
That he played
When he plays
No one speaks
No one speaks
When he plays
No one speaks
I cant let you guys  get off without screaming a couple of minutes
This one goes out to my sister Lisa
