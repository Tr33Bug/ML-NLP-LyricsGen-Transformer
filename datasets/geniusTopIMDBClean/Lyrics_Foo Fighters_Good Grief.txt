Since Im putting down
All of the true things around but I like it
Handed down my crown
Given the jewels and the answers of May
The thought of being ousted
Comes and goes comes and goes
When I think about it the wind blows
Hate it hate it
Hate it hate it
Hate it hate it
Hate it
Run me out of town
Somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels
Always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways
Gull and noun gull and noun
Chills and petty bandaids wrapped around
Hate it hate it
Hate it hate it
Hate it hate it
Hate it
Good grief
Good grief
Since Im putting down
All of the true things around but I like it
Handed down my crown
Given the jewels and the answers of May
The thought of being ousted
Comes and goes comes and goes
When I think about it the wind blows


Hate it hate it
Hate it hate it
Hate it hate it
Hate it
