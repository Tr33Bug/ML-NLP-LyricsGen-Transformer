Good Grief Lyrics
Since I'm putting down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down my crown
Given the jewels and the answers of May
The thought of being ousted
Comes and goes, comes and goes
When I think about it, the wind blows

Hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it
Hate it
Run me out of town
Somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels
Always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways
Gull and noun, gull and noun
Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around

Hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it
Hate it

Good grief
Good grief

Since I'm putting down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down my crown
Given the jewels and the answers of May
The thought of being ousted
Comes and goes, comes and goes
When I think about it, the wind blows
You might also like
Hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it
Hate it2Embed
