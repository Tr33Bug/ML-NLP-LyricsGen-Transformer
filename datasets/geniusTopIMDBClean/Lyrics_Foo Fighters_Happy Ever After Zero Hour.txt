Happy Ever After  Zero Hour  Lyrics
The sun went down on another perfect day
Busy counting shadows on the wall
The weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
Roses in the whiskey jar blood on the thorns
Drink until the taste is gone
Cracks in the floorboards are deep from dancing
To the sound of candles burning out
Heavy from writing your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone
Where is your ShangriLa now
Where is your ShangriLa now
Counting down to zero hours
There aint no superheroes now
There aint no superheroes theyre underground
Happy ever after counting down to zero hour
There aint no superheroes now
There aint no superheroes theyre underground
Happy ever after counting down to zero hour
Where is your ShangriLa now  Wheres your ShangriLa 
Where is your ShangriLa now  Wheres your ShangriLa 
Counting down to zero hours
There aint no superheroes now
There aint no superheroes theyre underground
Happy ever after counting down to zero hour
There aint no superheroes now
There aint no superheroes theyre underground
Happy ever after counting down to zero hour
