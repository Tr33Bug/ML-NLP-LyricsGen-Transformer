Come and Ill take you under
This beautiful bruises colors
Everything fades in time its true
Wish that I had another
Stab at the undercover
Was it a change in mind for you
Its impossible  I cant let it out
Youll never know  Am I selling you out
Sit and watch  Your every move move
Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue
Its impossible  I cant let it out
Youll never know  Am I selling you out
Sit and watch  Your every move move
Move move
Now that Ive found my reward
Id throw it away long before
Id share a piece of mind with you
Its impossible  I cant let it out
Youll never know  Am I selling you out
Sit and watch  Your every move move
Move move
