Wish I were with you
But I couldnt stay
Every direction
Leads me away
Pray for tomorrow
But for today
All I want is to be home
Stand in the mirror
You look the same
Just lookin for shelter
From cold and the pain
Someone to cover
Safe from the rain
All I want is to be home
Echoes and silence
Patience and grace
All of these moments
Ill never replace
No fear of my heart
Absence of faith
All I want is to be home
All I want is to be home


People Ive loved
I have no regrets
Some I remember
Some I forget
Some of them living
Some of them dead
All I want is to be home
