I shouldve known that it would end this way
I shouldve known there was no other way
Didnt hear your warning damn my heart gone deaf
I shouldve known look at the shape youre in
I shouldve known but I dove right in
One thing is for certain as Im standin here I shouldve known
Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
No I cannot forgive you yet
No I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
I shouldve known I was inside of you
I shouldve known there was that side of you
Came without a warning caught me unaware
I shouldve known Ive been here before
I shouldve known dont want it anymore
One thing is for certain Im still standin here I shouldve known
Lay your hands in mine
Feel me one last time
No I cannot forgive you yet
No I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No I cannot forgive you yet
No I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt I should have known
Maybe you was right didnt wanna fight
I should have known
Couldnt read the signs couldnt see the light
I should have known


No I cannot forgive you yet
No I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No I cannot forgive you yet
No I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No I cannot forgive you yet
No I cannot forgive you yet
You leave us all in debt I should have known
