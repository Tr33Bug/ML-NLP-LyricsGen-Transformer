I thought I knew all it took to bother you
Every word I said was true and that youll see
How could it be Im the only one who sees
Your rehearsed insanity Yeah
I still refused all the methods you abused
Its alright if youre confused let me be
Ive been around all the pawns youve gagged and bound
Theyll come back and knock you down and Ill be free
Ive taken all and Ive endured
One day it all will fade Im sure
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I had no hand in your ever desperate plan
It returns and when it lands words are due
I shouldve known we were better off alone
I looked in and I was shown you were too
Ive taken all and Ive endured
One day it all will fade Im sure
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything
I dont owe you anything


Ill stick around
Ill stick around and learn from all that came from it
Ill stick around
Ill stick around and learn from all that came from it
Ill stick around
Ill stick around and learn from all that came from it
Ill stick around
Ill stick around and learn from all that came from it
