La Dee Da Lyrics
Look out 'cause you know what you're doing
Turn up the American ruse
Whitehouse, Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom

You don't own this, la-dee-da
You don't own this, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Do you notice? La-dee-da
Got me goin', how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God
Hate if I want to, love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate!
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to, hate!

You can't shame me, la-dee-da
Give or take me, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God

Hate if I want to, love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate!
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to, oh, hate!


Hate if I want to, love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate!
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to, hate!
