Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die
Now Im looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
Im looking for a complication
Looking cause Im tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
I think Im done nursing the patience
It can wait one night
Id give it all away if you give me one last try
Well live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everythings alright
Now Im looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
Im looking for a complication
Looking cause Im tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to
Fly along with me I cant quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me I cant quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Im looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
Im looking for a complication
Looking cause Im tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to
Im looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
Im looking for a complication
Looking cause Im tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to fly
Make my way back home when I learn to
