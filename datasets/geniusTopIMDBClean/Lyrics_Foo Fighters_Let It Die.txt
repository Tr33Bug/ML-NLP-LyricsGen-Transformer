Heart of gold but it lost its pride
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
Ive seen your face in another light
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Whyd you have to go and let it die
In too deep and out of time
Whyd you have to go and let it die
A simple man and his blushing bride
Whyd you have to go and let it die 
Intravenous intertwined
Whyd you have to go and let it die 
Hearts gone cold your hands were tied
Whyd you have to go and let it die 
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Whyd you have to go and let it die 
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Whyd you have to go and let it die
In too deep and out of time
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Do you ever think of me
Youre so considerate
Do you ever think of me
Oh so considerate
In too deep and lost in time
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Hearts gone cold and hands are tied
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Whyd you have to go and let it die


Do you ever think of me
Youre so considerate
Did you ever think of me
Oh so considerate
In too deep and lost in time
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Beautiful veins and bloodshot eyes
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Hearts gone cold and hands are tied
Whyd you have to go and let it die
Whyd you have to go and let this die
Whyd you have to go and let this die
Whyd you have to go and let this die
Whyd you have to go and let this die
Whyd you have to go and let it die
