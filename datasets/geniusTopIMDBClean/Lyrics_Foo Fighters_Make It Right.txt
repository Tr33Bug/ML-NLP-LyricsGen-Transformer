Everybody needs everybody needs
Needs a little suffer
I just wanna do I just wanna do
Do a little number
Bite the hand that feeds bite the hand that feeds
Bite a little harder
Whats it gonna take whats it gonna take
Gonna take a lover
Hop on the train to nowhere baby
Dont you wanna hitch a ride
Lights go out and your head starts spinnin
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain your bad tuxedo
Brother can you spare a dime
Count whats left when its all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right
How you gonna make it right
Everybody breathe everybody breathe
Breathe a little deeper
Got no soul to keep got no soul to keep
Aint no brothers keeper
I dont fuckin need I dont fuckin need
I dont need a martyr
Whos it gonna be Whos it gonna be
Gonna be another
Hop on the train to nowhere baby
Dont you wanna hitch a ride
Lights go out and your head starts spinnin
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain your bad tuxedo
Brother can you spare a dime
Count whats left when its all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right
How you gonna make it right
Gonna make it right
How you gonna make it right
Make it right


Hop on the train to nowhere baby
Dont you wanna hitch a ride
Lights go out and your head starts spinnin
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain your bad tuxedo
Brother can you spare a dime
Count whats left when its all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right
How you gonna make it right
How you gonna make it right
Gonna make it right
Gonna make it right 
Gonna make it right
