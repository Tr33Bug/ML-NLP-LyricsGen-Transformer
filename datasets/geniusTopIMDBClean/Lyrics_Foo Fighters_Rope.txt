This indecision got me climbin up the wall
Been cheatin gravity and waitin on the fall
How did this come over me I thought I was above it all
Our hopes gone up in smoke swallow your crown
Choke On our kiss
Thought Id save my breath for you
Choke On our kiss
Thought Id save my breath for you
Gimme some rope Im comin loose
Im hangin on you
Gimme some rope Im comin loose
Im pullin for you now
Give me some rope Im comin
Outta my head into the clear
When you go I come loose
These premonitions got me cryin up a storm
Leave your condition this position does no harm
Choke On our kiss
Thought Id save my breath for you
Choke On our kiss
Thought Id save my breath for you
Gimme some rope Im comin loose
Im hangin on you
Gimme some rope Im comin loose
Im pullin for you now
Give me some rope Im comin
Outta my head into the clear
When you go I come loose
Gimme some rope Im comin loose
Im hangin on you
Gimme some rope Im comin loose
Im pullin for you now
Gimme some hope Im comin through
Im counting on you
Gimme some rope Im comin
Outta my head into the clear
When you go I come
Loose
