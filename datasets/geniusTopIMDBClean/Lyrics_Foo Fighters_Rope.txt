Rope Lyrics

This indecision got me climbin' up the wall
Been cheatin' gravity and waitin' on the fall
How did this come over me? I thought I was above it all
Our hope's gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm hangin' on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm pullin' for you now
Give me some rope, I'm comin'
Outta my head, into the clear
When you go, I come loose

These premonitions got me cryin' up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke! On our kiss
Thought I'd save my breath for you

Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm hangin' on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm pullin' for you now
Give me some rope, I'm comin'
Outta my head, into the clear
When you go, I come loose
You might also like

Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm hangin' on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin' loose
I'm pullin' for you now
Gimme some hope, I'm comin' through
I'm counting on you
Gimme some rope, I'm comin'
Outta my head, into the clear
When you go, I come
