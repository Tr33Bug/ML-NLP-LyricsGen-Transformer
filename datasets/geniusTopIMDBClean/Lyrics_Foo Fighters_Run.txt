Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me
In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run

We run
The rats are on parade another mad charade

The hounds are on the chase everythings erased
What you gonna do
I need some room to breathe you can stay asleep

They say thats nothings free you can run with me
If you wanted to

If you wanted to
Before the time runs out
Theres somewhere to run
Wake up

In another perfect life
In another perfect light

We are the nations stakes if everythings erased
What you gonna do

If you wanted to
Yeah you can run with me
