Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me
In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
The rats are on parade another mad charade
What you gonna do
The hounds are on the chase everythings erased
What you gonna do
I need some room to breathe you can stay asleep
If you wanted to
They say thats nothings free you can run with me
If you wanted to
Yeah you can run with me
If you wanted to
Before the time runs out
Theres somewhere to run
Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me
In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
Run
We are the nations stakes if everythings erased
What you gonna do
I need some room to breathe you can run with me
If you wanted to
Yeah you can run with me
If you wanted to
Before the time runs out
Theres somewhere to run
Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me
In another perfect life
In another perfect light
