There aint no secrets anymore
My names been hanging on the hook outside your door
Just an old eyesore
I got this feeling I cant keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing Saint Cecilia carry me home
To your house of broken bones
Youre out of sight Im out of mind
Been sitting watch your pictures drying on the line
Just a game of mine
I got this feeling I cant keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing Saint Cecilia carry me home
To your house of broken bones
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go no matter what I say
Nothings set in stone no matter what I say
Days go by
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go no matter what I say
Nothings set in stone no matter what I say
Days go by
I got this feeling I cant keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing Saint Cecilia carry me home
To your house of broken bones
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go no matter what I say
Nothings set in stone no matter what I say
Days go by
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go no matter what I say
Nothings set in stone no matter what I say
Days go by


I know no matter what I say  Saint Cecilia 
Days will come and go no matter what I say  Saint Cecilia 
Nothings set in stone no matter what I say
Days go by
I know no matter what I say  Saint Cecilia 
Days will come and go no matter what I say  Saint Cecilia 
Nothings set in stone no matter what I say
Days go by
