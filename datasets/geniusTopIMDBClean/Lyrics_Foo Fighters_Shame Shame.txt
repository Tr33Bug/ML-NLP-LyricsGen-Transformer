If you want to
Ill make you feel something real just to bother you
Now I got you
Under my thumb like a drug I will smother you
Ill be the one be the moon be the sun
Be the rain in your song go and put that record on
If you want to
Ill be the one be the tongue that will swallow you
Shame shame shame shame
Shame shame shame shame
Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness
I found a reason and buried it
Beneath a mountain of emptiness
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohoh ohoh
Oh ohohoh
Ohoh oh
Shame shame shame shame
Who what where when  Shame shame 
Just move along nothing wrong til we meet again  Shame shame 
Ill be the end  Shame shame 
Ill be the war at your door come and let me in  Shame shame 
Ill be the one be the moon be the sun  Shame shame 
Be the rain in your song go and put that record on  Shame shame 
If you want to  Shame shame 
Ill be the one be the tongue that will swallow you  Shame shame
