Give me the flammable life
Im cold as a match ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire
Singing along the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now here I go well
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye Im on my way
But in the end we all
Come from whats come before
So here I go well
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You had no choice you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye Im on my way
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
You took my word I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter
But you cant make me change my name
Youll never make me change my name
Pay no mind now aint thats something
Fuck it all I came from nothing
Im something from nothing
You are my fuse
Im something from nothing
You are my fuse
It goes oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
It goes oh oh oh
All rise
No you cant make me change my name
Youll never make me change my name
Pay no mind now wait thats something
Fuck it all I came from nothing
Im something from nothing
Im something from nothing
