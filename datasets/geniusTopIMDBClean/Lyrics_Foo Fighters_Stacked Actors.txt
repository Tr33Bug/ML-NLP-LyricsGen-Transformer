Oh mirror mirror youre coming in clear
Im finally somewhere in between
Im impressed what a beautiful chest
I never meant to make a big scene
Will you resign to the latest design
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams
One more for hire a wonderful liar
I think its time we all should come clean
Stack dead actors stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards all I want is the truth
Hey hey now can you fake it
Can you make it look like we won
Hey hey now can you take it
And we cry when they all die blonde
God bless what a sensitive mess
Yeah but things arent always what they seem
Your teary eyes your famous disguise
Never knowing who to believe
See through yeah but what do you do
When youre just another aging drag queen
Stack dead actors stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards all I want is the truth
Hey hey now can you fake it
Can you make it look like we won
Hey hey now can you take it
And we cry when they all die blonde
Stack dead actors stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards all I want is the truth
Stack dead actors stacked to the rafters
Line up all the bastards
And we cry when they all die blonde
Hey hey now can you fake it
Can you make it look like we won
Hey hey now can you take it
And we cry when they all die blonde
Stack dead actors stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards all I want is the truth
Stack dead actors stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards
And we cry when they all die blonde
