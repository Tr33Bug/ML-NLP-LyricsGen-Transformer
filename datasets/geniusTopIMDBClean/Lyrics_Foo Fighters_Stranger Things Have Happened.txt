Goddamn this dusty room
This hazy afternoon
Im breathing in this silence like never before
This feeling that I get
This one last cigarette
As I lay awake and wait for you to come through that door
Oh maybe maybe maybe I can share it with you
I behave I behave I behave so I can share it with you
You are not alone dear loneliness
You forgot but I remember this
Oh stranger stranger stranger things have happened I know
Im not alone dear loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
So stranger stranger stranger things have happened I know
Ohoh ohoh
And I dream about somewhere
A smoke will fill the air
As I lay awake and wait for you to walk out that door
I can change I can change I can change
But who you want me to be
Im the same Im the same Im the same
Oh do you want me to be
You are not alone dear loneliness
You forgot but I remember this
Oh stranger stranger stranger things have happened I know
Ohoh ohoh
Im not alone dear loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
You are not alone dear loneliness
You forgot but I remember this
Oh stranger stranger stranger things have happened I know
Im not alone dear loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
Oh stranger stranger stranger things have happened I know
Ohoh ohoh
