You say I take it for granted
I say youve taken it all
Say you can take it or leave it
You got your head in the ceiling
When are you gonna come down
When youre that high can you feel it
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its right down the drain I go
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its always a shame oh no
You wanna tell me a secret
You think Im gonna find out
You tell the lie you should keep it
Dont wanna know where its leading
Dont want to follow you round
My first mistake was believing
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its right down the drain I go
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its always a shame oh no
Are you a little afraid
A little alone
A little exhausted
Do you give it away  Do you give it away 
Do you let go  Do you let go 
Where do you find it Oh
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its right down the drain I go
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its always a shame oh no
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its right down the drain I go
Dont leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
Its always a shame oh no
A little afraid
A little alone
A little exhausted
Do you give it away
Try to let go
How do you find it Oh
A little afraid
A little alone
A little exhausted
Do you give it away
Do you let go
How do you find it
A little afraid
A little alone
A little exhausted
Do you give it away
Do you let go
Oh
