I dont wanna be king
I just wanna sing a love song
Pretend theres nothing wrong
You can sing along with me
I dont wanna be queen
Just trying to keep my tshirt clean
Theres one thing that I have learned
If it gets much better its going to get worse
And you get what you deserve
And you get what you deserve
