Yes or no what is truth
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue
I was wrong I was right
Im a blood moon born in the dead of night
Break my bones I dont care
All I ever wanted was a body to share
Hearts gone cold brush ran dry
Satellite searching for a sign of life
Like youoh ohoh
Ohoh ohoh
Somewhere are you there
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
Cause everythings on the line
This time
Listen close I cant hide
Im a page torn from a broken spine
Sun gets low I get high
Satellite searching for a sign of life
Like youoh ohoh
Ohoh ohoh
Somewhere are you there
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
Cause everythings on the line
This time
Are you there are you there
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
Cause everythings on the line
This time
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
Cause everythings on the line
Yes or no what is truth
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue
I was wrong I was right
Im a blood moon born in the dead of night
