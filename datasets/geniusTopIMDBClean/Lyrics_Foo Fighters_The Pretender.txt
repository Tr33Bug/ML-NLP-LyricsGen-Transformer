Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready
Im finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance that whole defense
Spinning infinity boy
The wheel is spinning me its never ending never ending
Same old story
What if I say Im not like the others
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays
Youre the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say Im not like the others
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays
Youre the pretender
What if I say that Ill never surrender
In time or so Im told
Im just another soul for sale oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent were temporary temporary
Same old story
What if I say Im not like the others
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays
Youre the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say Im not like the others
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays
Youre the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender


Im the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
Im the face that you have to face
Mirroring your stare
Im whats left Im whats right
Im the enemy
Im the hand thatll take you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you
Yeah who are you
Yeah who are you
Yeah who are you
Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
What if I say Im not like the others
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays
Youre the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say Im not like the others
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays
Youre the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say Im not like the others  Keep you in the dark 
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays  You know they all 
Youre the pretender  Pretend 
What if I say I will never surrender
What if I say Im not like the others  Keep you in the dark 
What if I say Im not just another one of your plays  You know they all 
Youre the pretender  Pretend 
What if I say I will never surrender
So who are you
Yeah who are you
Yeah who are you
