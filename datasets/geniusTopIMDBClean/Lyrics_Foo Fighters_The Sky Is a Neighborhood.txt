The Sky Is a Neighborhood Lyrics
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)

The sky is a neighborhood, so keep it down
The heart is a storybook, a star burned out
The sky is a neighborhood, don't make a sound
Lights coming up ahead, don't look now

The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't look now
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Mind is a battlefield, all hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left, whose side you're on?
Thoughts like a minefield, I'm a ticking bomb
Maybe you should watch your step, don't get lost

The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't get lost

Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood

The heart is a storybook, a star burned out
Something coming up ahead, don't look now

Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
(The sky is a neighborhood)
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
(The sky is a neighborhood)
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
