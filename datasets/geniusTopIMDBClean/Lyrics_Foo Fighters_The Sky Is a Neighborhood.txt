Ahah ahah ahahahah 
The sky is a neighborhood so keep it down
The heart is a storybook a star burned out
The sky is a neighborhood dont make a sound
Lights coming up ahead dont look now
The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Dont look now
Oh my dear Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin on the ceiling bangin on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh my dear Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin on the ceiling bangin on the ceiling
Keep it down
Mind is a battlefield all hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left whose side youre on
Thoughts like a minefield Im a ticking bomb
Maybe you should watch your step dont get lost
The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Dont get lost
Oh my dear Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin on the ceiling bangin on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh my dear Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin on the ceiling bangin on the ceiling
Keep it down
The sky is a neighborhood
The heart is a storybook a star burned out
Something coming up ahead dont look now
Oh my dear Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin on the ceiling bangin on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh my dear Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin on the ceiling bangin on the ceiling
Keep it down
The sky is a neighborhood 
Oh my dear Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
The sky is a neighborhood 
Bangin on the ceiling bangin on the ceiling
Keep it down
The sky is a neighborhood
