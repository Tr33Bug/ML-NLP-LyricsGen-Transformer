One of these days the ground will drop out from beneath your feet
One of these days your heart will stop and play its final beat
One of these days the clocks will stop and time wont mean a thing
One of these days their bombs will drop and silence everything
But its alright
Yeah its alright
I said its alright
Easy for you to say your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen not yet not yet
One of these days I bet your heartll be broken
I bet your pridell be stolen I bet I bet I bet I bet
One of these days one of these days
One of these days your eyes will close and pain will disappear
One of these days you will forget to hope and learn to fear
But its alright
Yeah its alright
I said its alright
Easy for you to say your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen not yet not yet
One of these days I bet your heartll be broken
I bet your pridell be stolen I bet I bet I bet I bet
One of these days one of these days
But its alright
Yeah its alright
I said its alright
Yeah its alright
Dont say its alright
Dont say its alright
Dont say its alright


One of these days your heart will stop and play its final beat
But its alright
Easy for you to say your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen not yet not yet
One of these days I bet your heartll be broken
I bet your pridell be stolen I bet I bet I bet I bet
One of these days one of these days
One of these days
