This Is a Call Lyrics
Visiting is pretty
Visiting is good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a brother
This can be a secret
We can keep it good
Even all they ever wanted had a problem

This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
Fingernails are pretty
Fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking
Them balloons are pretty
Big and say they should ever fall to ground
Call the magic marker

This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my past resignations
It's been too long

Minicyn is pretty
Minicyn is good
Even all the cysts and mollusks tend to barter
Ritalin is easy
Ritalin is good
Even all the ones that watered down the daughter

This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my past resignations
It's been too long

Fingernails are pretty
Fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking
Them balloons are pretty
Big and say they should ever fall to ground
Call the magic marker

This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my past resignations
It's been too long7Embed
