I Im a one way motorway
Im the one that drives away follows you back home
I Im a street light shining
Im a white light blinding bright burning off and on
Uhhuh
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these time and time again
I Im a new day rising
Im a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
But I Im a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind
Uhhuh
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these time and time again
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these time and time again
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these time and time again
Its times like these you learn to live again
Its times like these you give and give again
Its times like these you learn to love again
Its times like these time and time again
