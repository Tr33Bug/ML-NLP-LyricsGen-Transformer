Ive been waiting on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
Never really wanted to be number one
Just wanted to love everyone

Is there more to this more to this
More to this than
Just waiting on a war
Just waiting on a war
Every day waiting for the sky to fall
Big crash on a world thats so small
Just a boy with nowhere left to go
Fell in love with a voice on the radio

Is there more to this than that
Is there more to this than that
Is there more to this more to this
More to this than

Just waiting on a war
Just waiting on a war for this and that
Theres got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
Theres got to be more to this than that
