A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Gettin good at startin over
Every time that I return
Im learnin to walk again
I believe Ive waited long enough
Where do I begin
Im learnin to talk again
Cant you see Ive waited long enough
Where do I begin
Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn
I think I found my place
Cant you feel it growin stronger
Little conquerors
Im learnin to walk again
I believe Ive waited long enough
Where do I begin
Im learnin to talk again
I believe Ive waited long enough
Where do I begin
Now
For the very first time
Dont you pay no mind
Set me free again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowin to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
Im on my knees Im prayin for a sign
Forever whenever I never want to die
I never want to die I never want to die
Im on my knees I never want to die
Im dancin on my grave Im runnin through the fire
Forever whenever I never want to die
I never want to leave I never say goodbye
Forever whenever forever whenever


Im learnin to walk again
I believe Ive waited long enough
Where do I begin
Im learnin to talk again
Cant you see Ive waited long enough
Where do I begin
Im learnin to walk again
I believe Ive waited long enough
Im learnin to talk again
Cant you see Ive waited long enough
