One two three four
I know what youre thinking
We were going down
I can feel the sinking
But then I came around
And everyone Ive loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothing mattered anymore
I looked into the sky
Well I wanted something better man
I wished for something new
And I wanted something beautiful
And wish for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down 
When the wheels touch ground  When the wheels touch ground 
And you feel like its all over
Theres another round for you
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down 
Know your head is spinning
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginning
Coming to an end
Well you wanted something better man
You wished for something new
Well you wanted something beautiful
You wished for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down 
When the wheels touch ground  When the wheels touch ground 
And you feel like its all over
Theres another round for you
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down 
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down 
When the wheels touch ground  When the wheels touch ground 
And you feel like its all over
Theres another round for you
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down 
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down 
When the wheels touch ground  When the wheels touch ground 
And you feel like its all over
Theres another round for you
When the wheels come down  When the wheels come down
