All of Me LyricsAll of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get on without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me
All of me
Come on get all of me
Can't you see
I'm just a mess without you
Take my lips
I wanna lose them
Get a piece of these arms
I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I ever make it without you
You know you got the part
Used to be my heart
So why not, why not take all of meYou might also likeEmbed
