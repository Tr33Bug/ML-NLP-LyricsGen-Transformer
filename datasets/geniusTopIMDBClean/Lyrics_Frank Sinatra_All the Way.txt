When somebody loves you
Its no good unless he loves you
All the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you
All the way
Taller than the tallest tree is
Thats how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
Thats how deep it goes if its real
When somebody needs you
Its no good unless he needs you
All the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the inbetween years
Come what may
Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
Its for sure Im gonna love you
All the way
All the way
So if you let me love you
Its for sure Im gonna love you
All the way
All the way
