Brazil where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured Someday soon
We kissed and clung together
Then tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now when twilight dims the skies above
Recalling thrills of our love
Theres one thing Im certain of
Return I will to old Brazil
Then tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
Theres one thing that Im certain of
Return I will to old Brazil
That old Brazil
Man its old in Brazil
Brazil Brazil
