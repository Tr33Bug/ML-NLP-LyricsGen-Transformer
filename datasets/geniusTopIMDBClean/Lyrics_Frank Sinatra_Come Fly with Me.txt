Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
If you can use some exotic booze theres a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
Come fly with me lets float down to Peru
In llama land theres a one man band and hell toot his flute for you
Come fly with me lets take off in the blue
Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
Well just glide starryeyed
Once I get you up there Ill be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer cause were together
Weather wise its such a lovely day
Just say the words and well beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
Its perfect for a flying honeymoon they say
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
Well just glide starryeyed
Once I get you up there Ill be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer cause were together
Weather wise its such a lovely day
You just say the words and well beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
Its perfect for a flying honeymoon they say
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly
Pack up lets fly away
