Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On aJupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words in other words
I love you
