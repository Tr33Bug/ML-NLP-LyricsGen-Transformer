Next time youre found with your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned so look around
Just what makes that little old ant
Think hell move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant cant
Move a rubber tree plant
But hes got high hopes hes got high hopes
Hes got high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time youre gettin low
stead of lettin go
Just remember that ant
Oops there goes another rubber tree plant
When troubles call and your backs to the wall
There a lot to be learned that wall could fall
Once there was a silly old ram
Thought hed punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram scram
He kept buttin that dam
Cause he had high hopes he had high hopes
He had high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time youre feelin bad
stead of feelin sad
Just remember that ram
Oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam
All problems just a toy balloon
Theyll be bursted soon
Theyre just bound to go pop
Oops there goes another problem kerplop
