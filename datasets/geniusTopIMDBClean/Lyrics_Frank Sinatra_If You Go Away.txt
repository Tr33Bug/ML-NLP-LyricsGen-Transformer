If you go away on this summer day
Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new and our hearts were high
When the day was young and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night birds song
If you go away if you go away if you go away
But if you stay Ill make you a day
Like no day has been or will be again
Well sail the sun well ride on the rain
Well talk to the trees and worship the wind
Then if you go Ill understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand
If you go away if you go away if you go away
If you go as I know you will you must tell the world to stop turning
Till you return again if you ever do for what good is love without loving you
Can I tell you now as you turn to go Ill be dying slowly till the next hello
If you go away if you go away if you go away
But if you stay Ill make you a night
Like no night has been or will be again
Ill sail on your smile Ill ride on your touch
Ill talk to your eyes that I love so much
But if you go go I wont cry
Though the good is gone from the word goodbye
If you go away if you go away if you go away
If you go away as I know you must
Therell be nothing left in the world to trust
Just an empty room full of empty space
Like the empty look I see on your face
Id have been the shadow of your shadow
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away if you go away if you go away
Please dont go away
