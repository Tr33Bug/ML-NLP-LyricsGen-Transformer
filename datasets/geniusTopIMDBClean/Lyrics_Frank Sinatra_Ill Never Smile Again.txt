Ill never smile again
Until I smile at you
Ill never laugh again
What good would it do
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is through
Ill never love again
Im so in love with you
Ill never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you
Until I smile at you
