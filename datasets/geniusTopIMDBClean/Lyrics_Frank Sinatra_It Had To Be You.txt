Why do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh
Why dont I try to forget
It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying I had to wait
I saw them all
Just couldnt fall til we met
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and I finally found
The somebody who could make me be true
And could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinking of you
Some others Ive seen
Might never been mean
Might never be crossed or try to be bossed
But they wouldnt do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you wonderful you
It had to be you
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you wonderful you
It had to be you
