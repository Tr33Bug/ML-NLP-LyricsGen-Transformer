When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
Wed hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen
When I was twentyone
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twentyone
When I was thirtyfive
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blueblooded girls
Of independent means
Wed ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirtyfive
But now the days are short
Im in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year
