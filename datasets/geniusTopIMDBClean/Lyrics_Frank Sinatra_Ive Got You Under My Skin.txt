Ive got you under my skin
Ive got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that youre really a part of me
Ive got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
Ive got you under my skin
Id sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats repeats in my ear
Dont you know little fool you never can win
Use your mentality wake up to reality
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause Ive got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Dont you know little fool you never can win
Why not use your mentality Step up wake up to reality
But each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause Ive got you under my skin
Yes Ive got you under my skin
