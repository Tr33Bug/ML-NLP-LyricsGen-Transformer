Ive got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life Im in love
Ive got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me cant you see Im in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
Id be a silly soandso
If I should ever let it go
Ive got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life Im in love
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
Id be a silly soandso
If I should ever let it go
I got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
And this is the life
Hey now
Im so in love
