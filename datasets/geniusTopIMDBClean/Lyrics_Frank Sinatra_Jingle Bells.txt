I love those JINGLE bells
Oh those holiday JINGLE bells
Oh those happy JINGLE
BEdoubleL S
I love those JINGLE bells
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow  Rudolph 
In a one horse open sleigh  Today 
Oer the fields we go  Rudolph 
Laughing all the way  Today 
Bells on bobtail ring
Makin our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighin song tonight
Ho ho ho
Ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
Ho ho ho ho ho ho
Jingle bells jingjingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
I love those JINGLE bells
Oh those holiday JINGLE bells
Oh those happy JINGLE
BEdoubleL S
I love those jingle bells all the way  Jingle all the way
