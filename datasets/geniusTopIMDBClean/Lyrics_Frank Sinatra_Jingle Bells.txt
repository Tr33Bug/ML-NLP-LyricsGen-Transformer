Jingle Bells Lyrics
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those holiday J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those happy J-I-N-G-L-E
B-E-double-L S
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one horse open sleigh (Today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (Today)
Bells on bob-tail ring
Makin' our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighin' song tonight

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

Jingle bells, jing-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
I love those J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those holiday J-I-N-G-L-E bells
Oh, those happy J-I-N-G-L-E
B-E-double-L S
I love those jingle bells all the way! (Jingle all the way!)You might also likeEmbed
