Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since weve no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
It doesnt show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
When we finally kiss goodnight
How Ill hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home Ill be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear were still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
He doesnt care if its in below
Hes sitting by the fires gloosy glow
He dont care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says Let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let It Snow 
OoooohWee goes the storm
Why should he worry when hes nice and warm
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says Let it snow let it snow
I Dont Care 
The weather outside Is frightful
But that fire Is ummm delightful
Since weve no place to go
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
It doesnt show signs of stopping
And Ive brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are way down low
So let it snow let it snow let it snow
Let it snow 
When weve finally say goodnight
How Ill hate going out In a storm
But If youll only hold me tight
All the way home Ill be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And my dear were still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow let it snow let it snow
