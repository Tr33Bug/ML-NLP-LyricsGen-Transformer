They call you Lady Luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very unladylike way of running out
Youre on this date with me
The pickins have been lush
And yet before this evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck if youve ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I know the way youve treated other guys youve been with
Luck be a lady with me
A lady doesnt leave her escort
It isnt fair it isnt nice
A lady doesnt wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby Im the fella you came in with
Luck be a lady tonight
A lady never flirts with strangers
Shed have a heart shed be nice
A lady doesnt wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby Im the guy that you came in with
Luck be a lady tonight
