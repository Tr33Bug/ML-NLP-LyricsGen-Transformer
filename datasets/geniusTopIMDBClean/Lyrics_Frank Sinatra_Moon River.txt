Moon River wider than a mile
Im crossin you in style someday
Oh dream maker you heartbreaker
Wherever youre going Im going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
Theres such a lot of world to see
Were after the same rainbows end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend Moon River
And me
Two drifters off to see the world
Theres such a lot of world to see
Were after the same rainbows end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend Moon River
And me
