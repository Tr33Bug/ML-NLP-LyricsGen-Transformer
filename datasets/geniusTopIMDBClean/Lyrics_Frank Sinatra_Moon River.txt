Moon River LyricsMoon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you in style someday
Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River
And me
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River
And meYou might also like1Embed
