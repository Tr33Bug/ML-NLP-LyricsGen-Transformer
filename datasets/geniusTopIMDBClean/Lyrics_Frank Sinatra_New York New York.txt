TranslationsFrank Sinatra  New York New York   Greek Translation 
Start spreading the news Im leaving today
I want to be a part of it New York New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it New York New York
I wanna wake up in a city that doesnt sleep
And find Im king of the hill top of the heap
These little town blues are melting away
Ill make a brand new start of it in old New York
If I can make it there Ill make it anywhere
Its up to you New York New York
New York New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find Im a number one top of the list
King of the hill a number one
These little town blues oh are melting away
Im gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there Im gonna make it anywhere
Its up to you New York New York
