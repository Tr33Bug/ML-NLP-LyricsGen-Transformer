Lets take it nice and easy
Its gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love
Hey baby whats your hurry
Relax and dont you worry
Were gonna fall in love
Were on the road to romance thats safe to say
But lets make all the stops along the way
The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
Cause nice and easy does it every time
Were on the road to romance thats safe to say
But lets make all the stops along the way
The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
Cause nice and easy does it
Nice n easy does it
Nice n easy does it every time
Like the man says one more time
Nice n easy does it
Nice n easy does it
Nice n easy does it every time
