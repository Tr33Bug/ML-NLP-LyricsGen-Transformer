One for My Baby  And One More for the Road  Lyrics
Its quarter to three
Theres no one in the place cept you and me
So set em up Joe
I got a little story I think you should know
Were drinkin my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
Feelin so bad
Cant you make the music easy and sad
I could tell you a lot
But youve gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
Youd never know it
But buddy Im a kind of poet
And Ive got a lot of things Id like to say
And when Im gloomy
Wont you listen to me
Til its talked away
Well thats how it goes
And Joe I know youre gettin anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didnt mind my bending your ear
But this torch that Ive found
Its gotta be drowned
Or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
The long its so long
The long very long
