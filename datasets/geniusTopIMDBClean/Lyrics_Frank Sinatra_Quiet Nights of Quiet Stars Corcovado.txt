Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars (Corcovado) LyricsQuiet nights of quiet stars
Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And a window looking on the mountains and the sea
How lovely
This is where I want to be
Here with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember
I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence, my love
I who was lost and lonely
Believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence, my loveYou might also like1Embed
