Isnt it rich
Are we a pair
Me here at last on the ground
You in midair
Send in the clowns
Isnt it bliss
Dont you approve
One who keeps tearing around
One who cant move
Where are the clowns
Send in the clowns
Just when Id stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there
Dont you love farce
My fault I fear
I thought that youd want what I want
Sorry my dear
But where are the clowns
Send in the clowns
Dont bother theyre here
Isnt it rich
Isnt it queer
Losing my timing this late
In my career
Where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns
Well maybe next year
