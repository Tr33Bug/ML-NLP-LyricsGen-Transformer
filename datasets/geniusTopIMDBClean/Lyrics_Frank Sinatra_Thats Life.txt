Thats life  Thats life  thats what all the people say
Youre riding high in April shot down in May
But I know Im gonna change that tune
When Im back on top back on top in June
I said thats life  Thats life  and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stompin on a dream
But I dont let it let it get me down
Cause this fine old world it keeps spinning around
Ive been a puppet a pauper a pirate a poet a pawn and a king
Ive been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race
Thats life  Thats life  I tell ya I cant deny it
I thought of quitting baby
But my heart just aint gonna buy it
And if I didnt think it was worth one single try
Id jump right on a big bird and then Id fly
Ive been a puppet a pauper a pirate a poet a pawn and a king
Ive been up and down and over and out and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
Thats life  Thats life  thats life and I cant deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart wont buy it
But if theres nothing shaking come this here July
Im gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My my
