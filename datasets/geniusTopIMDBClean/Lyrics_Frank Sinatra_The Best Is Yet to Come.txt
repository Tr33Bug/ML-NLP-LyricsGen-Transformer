Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still its a real good bet the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe wont that be fine
You think youve seen the sun but you aint seen it shine
AWait till the warmups underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You aint seen nothin yet
The best is yet to come and babe wont it be fine
Best is yet to come come the day youre mine
Come the day youre mine
Im gonna teach you to fly
Weve only tasted the wine
Were gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think youve flown before but baby you aint left the ground
AWait till youre locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
AWait till you see that sunshine place
Aint nothin like it here
The best is yet to come and babe wont it be fine
The best is yet to come come the day youre mine
Come the day youre mine
And youre gonna be mine
