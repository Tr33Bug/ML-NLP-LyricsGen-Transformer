Way down among Brazilians
Coffee beans grow by the billions
So theyve got to find those extra cups to fill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You cant get cherry soda
Cause theyve got to fill that quota
And the way things are Ill bet they never will
Theyve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice
Youll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no
The politicians daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You date a girl and find out later
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil
And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice
Youll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no
So your lead to the local color
Serving coffee with a cruller
Dunking doesnt take a lot of skill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
