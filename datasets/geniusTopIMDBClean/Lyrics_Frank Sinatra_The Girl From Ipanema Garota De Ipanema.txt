The Girl From Ipanema  Garota De Ipanema  Lyrics
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes ah
When she walks shes like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes  ooh
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesnt see doesnt see
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graa
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balano a caminho do mar
Moa do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balanado parece um poema
a coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar
Ooh but I watch her so sadly
Ah porque tudo  to triste
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall tan young lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesnt see
Por causa do amor
She just doesnt see
Nem olha para mim
She never sees me
Por causa do amor
