The Impossible Dream  The Quest  LyricsTo dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
To be better far than you are  
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest to follow that star
No matter how hopeless no matter how far
To be willing to give when theres no more to give   
To be willing to die so that honor and justice may live   
And I know if Ill only be true to this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm when Im laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable star
