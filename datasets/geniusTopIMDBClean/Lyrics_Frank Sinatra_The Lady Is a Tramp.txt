She gets too hungry for dinner at eight
She likes the theatre and never comes late
She never bothers with people shed hate
Thats why the lady is a tramp
Doesnt like crap games with barons or earls
Wont go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Wont dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
Thats why the lady is a tramp
She likes the free fresh wind in her hair life without care
Shes broke and its oke
Hates California its cold and its damp
Thats why the lady is a tramp
She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight
She loves the theatre but never comes late
Shed never bother with people shed hate
Thats why the lady is a tramp
Shell have no crap games with sharpies and frauds
And she wont go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords
And she wont dish the dirt with the rest of the broads
Thats why the lady is a tramp
She loves the free fresh wind in her hair life without care
Shes broke but its oke
Hates California its so cold and so damp
Thats why the lady thats why the lady
Thats why the lady is a tramp
