Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me oh no
Its just the nearness of you
It isnt your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation oh no
Its just the nearness of you
When youre in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If youll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you
