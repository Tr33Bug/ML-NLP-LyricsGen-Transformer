The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star
It was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so so did i
Now when I remember spring
And every little lovely thing
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
Your lovely smile
