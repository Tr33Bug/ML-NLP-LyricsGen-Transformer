Some day when Im awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes youre lovely with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Lovely never never change
Keep that breathless charm
Wont you please arrange it Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely dont you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Wont you please arrange it Cause I love you
Ajust the way you look tonight
Mmmm mmmm
Just the way you look tonight
