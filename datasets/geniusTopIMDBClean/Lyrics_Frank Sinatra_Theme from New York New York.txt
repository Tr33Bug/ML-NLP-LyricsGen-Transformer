Theme from New York, New York Lyrics
Start spreadin' the news
I'm leavin' today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I want to wake up
In a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These little-town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New York
New York, New York

I want to wake up in a city
That never sleeps
And find I'm "A" number one
Top of the list
King of the hill, "A" number one...

These...little town.... blues
Are...melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it
In old New York
You might also like
And... If I can make it there
I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you
New York, New Yoooooooooork...
