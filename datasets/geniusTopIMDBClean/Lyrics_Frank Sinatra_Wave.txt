Wave Lyrics
So close your eyes, for that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

You can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch the wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch that wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
