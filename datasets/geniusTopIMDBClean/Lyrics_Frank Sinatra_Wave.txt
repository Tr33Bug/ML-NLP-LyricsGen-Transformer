So close your eyes for thats a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
You cant deny dont try to fight the rising sea
Dont fight the moon the stars above and dont fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch the wave dont be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity
By now we know the wave is on its way to be
Just catch that wave dont be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
Together
Together
