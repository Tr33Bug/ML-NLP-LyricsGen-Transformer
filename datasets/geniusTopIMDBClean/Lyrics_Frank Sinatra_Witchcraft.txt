Those fingers in my hair
That sly comehither stare
That strips my conscience bare
Its witchcraft
And Ive got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do
Cause its witchcraft wicked witchcraft
And although I know its strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says Yes indeed in me
Proceed with what youre leadin me to
Its such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldnt switch
Cause theres no nicer witch than you
Cause its witchcraft that crazy witchcraft
And although I know its strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says Yes indeed in me
Proceed with what youre leadin me to
Its such an ancient pitch
But one that Id never switch
Cause theres no nicer witch than you
