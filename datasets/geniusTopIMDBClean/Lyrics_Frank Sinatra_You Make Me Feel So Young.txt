You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
Im such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hideandseek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forgetmenots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when Im old and gray
Im gonna feel the way I do today
Cause you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
Im such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna go and play hideandseek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forgetmenots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
Wonderful fling to be flung
And even when Im old and gray
Im gonna feel the way I do today
Cause you you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
Ooh you make me feel so young
