Fairy tales can come true it can happen to you
If youre young at heart
For its hard you will find to be narrow of mind
If youre young at heart
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on its way
Dont you know that its worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as rich as you are its much better by far
To be young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Look at all youll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart
And if you should survive to 105
Look at all youll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart
