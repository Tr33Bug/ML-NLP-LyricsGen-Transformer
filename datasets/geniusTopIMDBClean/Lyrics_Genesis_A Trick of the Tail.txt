Bored of the life
In the city of gold
Hed left and let nobody know
Gone were the towers
He had known from a child
Along with a dream of a life
He traveled the wide open road
The blinkered arcade
In search of another to share in his life
Nowhere everyone looked so strange to him
They got no horns and they got no tail
They dont even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance
He cried and wept
As they led him away to a cage
Beast that can talk read the sign
The creatures they pushed
And they prodded his frame
And questioned his story again
But soon they grew bored of their prey
The beast that can talk
More like a freak or publicity stunt
Oh oh no oh
They got no horns and they got no tail
They dont even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance
He cried and broke down the door
Of the cage and marched on out
He grabbed a creature
By the scruff of his neck pointing out
There beyond the bounds
Of your weak imagination
Lie the noble towers
Of my city bright and gold
Let me take you there
Show you a living story
Let me show you others such as me
Why did I ever leave
They got no horns and they got no tail
They dont even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance
He cried and wept
And so we set out
With the beast and his horns
And his crazy description of home
After many days journey
We came to a peak
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out
We followed his gaze and we thought
That maybe we saw
A spire of gold No a trick of the eye thats all
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard
They got no horns and they got no tail
They dont even know of our existence
Am I wrong to believe in the city of gold
That lies in the deep distance
