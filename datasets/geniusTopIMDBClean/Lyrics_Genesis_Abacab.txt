Look up on the wall
There on the floor
Under the pillow
Behind the door
Theres a crack in the mirror
Somewhere theres a hole in a windowpane
Now do you think Im to blame
Tell me do you think Im to blame
When they do it  youre never there
When they show it  you stop and stare
Abacab  isnt anywhere
Abacab 
If youre wrappin
Up the world
Cause youve taken
Someone elses girl
When they turn on the pillow
Even when they answer the telephone
Dont you think theyll find out
Tell me dont you think theyll find out
When they do it  youre never there
When they show it  you stop and stare
Abacab  isnt anywhere
Abacab  doesnt really care
You want it youve got it youve gotta go
You want it youve got it now you know
Its an illusion
Its a game
A reflection
Of someone elses name
When you wake in the morning
Wake and find youre covered in cellophane

Well theres a hole in there somewhere
Yeah theres a hole in there somewhere
Baby theres a hole in there somewhere
Now theres a hole in there somewhere
When they do it  youre never there
When they show it  you stop and stare
Abacab  isnt anywhere
Abacab
