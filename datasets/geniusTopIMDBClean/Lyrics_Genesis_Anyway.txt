All the pumpings nearly over for my sweetheart
This is the one for me time to meet the chef
Oh boy the running man is out of death
Feel cold and old its getting hard to catch my breath
Its back to ash Now youve had your flash boy
The rocks in time compress
Your blood to oil your flesh to coal
Enrich the soil not everybodys goal
Anyway they say she comes on a pale horse
But Im sure I hear a train
Oh boy I dont even feel no pain
I guess I must be driving myself insane
Damn it all Does Earth plug a hole in Heaven
Or Heaven plug a hole in Earth
How wonderful to be so profound
When everything you are is dying underground
I feel the pull on the rope let me off at the rainbow
I could have been exploding in space
Different orbits for my bones
Not me just quietly buried in stones
Keep the deadline open with my maker
See me stretch for Gods elastic acre
The doorbell rings and its Good morning Rael
So sorry you had to wait
It wont be long yeah
Shes very rarely late
