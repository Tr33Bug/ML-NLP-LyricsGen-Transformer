Anyway Lyrics
All the pumping's nearly over for my sweetheart
This is the one for me, time to meet the chef
Oh boy, the running man is out of death
Feel cold and old, it's getting hard to catch my breath
It's back to ash, “Now you've had your flash, boy”
The rocks, in time, compress
Your blood to oil, your flesh to coal
Enrich the soil, not everybody's goal

Anyway, they say she comes on a pale horse
But I'm sure I hear a train
Oh boy, I don't even feel no pain
I guess I must be driving myself insane
Damn it all! Does Earth plug a hole in Heaven
Or Heaven plug a hole in Earth?
How wonderful to be so profound
When everything you are is dying underground
I feel the pull on the rope, let me off at the rainbow
I could have been exploding in space
Different orbits for my bones
Not me, just quietly buried in stones
Keep the deadline open with my maker
See me stretch for God's elastic acre
The doorbell rings, and it's, “Good morning, Rael
So sorry you had to wait
It won't be long, yeah
She's very rarely late”You might also likeEmbed
