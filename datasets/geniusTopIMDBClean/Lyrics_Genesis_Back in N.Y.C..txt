Back in NYC Lyrics
I see faces and traces of home
Back in New York City huh
So you think Im a tough kid
Is that what you heard
Yeah well I like to see some action
And it gets into my blood
They call me the trail blazer
Rael electric razor
Im the pitcher in a chain gang
We dont believe in pain
Cause were only as strong
Yes were only as strong
As the weakest link in the chain
Let me out of Pontiac
When I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me
If you know what I mean what I mean
Aaaah You say I must be crazy
Cause I dont care who I hit who I hit
But I know its me thats hitting out
And Im Im not full of shit
I dont care who I hurt
I dont care who I do wrong
This is your mess Im stuck in
I really dont belong
When I take out my bottle
Filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires
Where Rael has been has been
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hair
Time to shave shave it off it off


No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape  No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape  No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape  No 
Off we go
Off we go
Off we go
Off we go
Youre sitting in your comfort
You dont believe Im real
You cannot buy protection
From the way that I feel
Your progressive hypocrites
Hand out their trash
But it was mine in the first place
So Ill burn it to ash
And Ive tasted all the strongest meats
And laid them down in coloured sheets
Laid them down in coloured sheets
Who needs illusion of love and affection
When youre out walking in the streets
With your mainline connection connection
As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hair
Time to shave shave it off it off
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape  No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape  No 
No time for romantic escape
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No time
