Dark and grey an English film the Wednesday Play
We always watch the Queen on Christmas Day
Wont you stay
Though your eyes see shipwrecked sailors youre still dry
The outlooks fine though Wales might have some rain
Saved again
Lets skip the news boy  Ill go and make some tea 
Arabs and Jews boy  too much for me 
They get me confused boy  puts me off to sleep 
And the thing I hateOh Lord
Is staying up late to watch some debate on some nations fate
Hypnotised by Batman Tarzan still surprised
Youve won the West in time to be our guest
Name your prize
Drop of wine a glass of beer dear whats the time
The grime on the Tyne is mine all mine all mine
Five past nine
Blood on the rooftopsVenice in the Spring
The Streets of San Franciscoa word from Peking
The trouble was startedby a young Errol Flynn
Better in my dayOh Lord
For when we got bored wed have a world war happy but poor
So lets skip the news boy  Ill go and make some tea 
Blood on the rooftops  too much for me 
When old Mother Goose stopsand theyre out for 23
Then the rain at Lords stopped play
Seems Helen of Troy has found a new face again
