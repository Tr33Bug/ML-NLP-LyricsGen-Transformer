Echoes of the Broadway Everglades
With our mythical Madonna
Still walking in their shades
Lenny Bruce declares a truce
And plays his other hand
Marshall McLuhan casual viewing
Head buried in the sand
Sirens on the rooftops wailing
But theres no ship sailing
Groucho with his movies trailing
Stands alone with his punchline failing
Ku Klux Klan serve hot soul food
And the band plays In the Mood
The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand
Theres a smell of peach blossom and bitter almond
Caryl Chessman sniffs the air and leads the parade
He knows in a scent you can bottle all you made
Theres Howard Hughes
In blue suede shoes
Smiling at the majorettes
Smoking Winston Cigarettes
And as the song and dance begins
The children play at home
With needles needles and pins
