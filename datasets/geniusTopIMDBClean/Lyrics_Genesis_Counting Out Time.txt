Im counting out time
Got the whole thing down by numbers
All those numbers
Give me guidance
Oh Lord I need that now
The Day of Judgements come
And you can bet that Ive been resting
For this testing
Digesting every word the experts say
Erogenous zones I love you
Without you what would a poor boy do
Found a girl I wanted to date
Thought Id better get it straight
Went to buy a book before its too late
Dont leave nothing to fate
I studied every line
Every page in the book
And now Ive got the real thing here
Im gonna take a look take a look
This is it Rael 
Im counting out time
Hoping it goes like I planned it
Cause I understand it
Look Ive found the hotspots figures 1 to 9
Still counting out time
I got my finger on the button
Dont say nothin
Just lie there still
And Ill get you turned on just fine
Erogenous zones I love you
Without you what would a poor boy do
Touch and go with 1 to 6
Bit of trouble in zone number 7
Gotta remember all of my tricks
Theres heaven ahead in number 11
Getting crucial responses
With dilation of the pupils
Honey get hip Its time to unzip
To unzip zip zipazipazip
Whoopee
Take it away Mr Guitar 
Move over Casanova 
Im counting out time
Reaction none too happy
Please dont slap me
Im a redblooded male
And the book said I could not fail
Im counting out time
I got unexpected distress
From my mistress
Ill get my money back
From the bookstore right away
Erogenous zones I question you
Without you what would a poor boy do
Without you what would a poor boy do
Without you mankind handkinds
Through the blues
