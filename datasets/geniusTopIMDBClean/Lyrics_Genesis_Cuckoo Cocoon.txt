Wrapped up in some powdered wool
I guess Im losing touch
Dont tell me this is dying
Cause I aint changed that much
The only sound is water drops
I wonder where the hell I am
Some kind of jam
Cuckoo cocoon
Have I come to too soon for you
Theres nothing I can recognize
This is nowhere that Ive known
With no sign of life at all
I guess that Im alone
And I feel so secure
That I know this cant be real
But I feel good
Cuckoo cocoon
Have I come to too soon for you
I wonder if Im a prisoner
Locked in some Brooklyn jail
Or some sort of Jonah
Shut up inside the whale
No Im still Rael and Im stuck
In some kind of cave
What couldve saved me
Cuckoo cocoon
Have I come to too soon for you
