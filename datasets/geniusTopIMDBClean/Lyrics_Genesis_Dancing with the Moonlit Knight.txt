Can you tell me where my country lies
Said the unifaun to his true loves eyes
It lies with me cried the Queen of Maybe
For her merchandise he traded in his prize
Paper late cried a voice in the crowd
Old man dies The note he left was signed Old Father Thames
It seems hes drowned
Selling England by the pound
Citizens of Hope and Glory
Time goes by its the time of your life
Easy now sit you down
Chewing through your Wimpy dreams
They eat without a sound
Digesting England by the pound
Young man says you are what you eat eat well
Old man says you are what you wear wear well
You know what you are you dont give a damn
Bursting your belt that is your homemade sham
The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
Join the dance
Follow on til the Grail sun sets in the mould
Follow on til the gold is cold
Dancing out with the moonlit knight
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shout


Theres a fat old lady outside the saloon
Laying out the credit cards she plays Fortune
The deck is uneven right from the start
And all of their hands are playing a part
The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
Join the dance
Follow on a Round Tabletalking down we go
Youre the show off we go with
You play the hobbyhorse Ill play the fool
Well tease the bull
Ringing round diddle loud loud diddle round
Follow on with a twist of the world we go
Follow on til the gold is cold
Dancing out with the moonlit knight
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shout
