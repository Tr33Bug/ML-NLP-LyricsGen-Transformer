Domino  Part 1  2  LyricsPart 1 In the Glow of the Night
The grey of evening fills the room
Theres no need to look outside
To see or feel the rain
Then I reach across to touch her
But I know that shes not there
Rain keeps running down the window pane
Time is running out for me
Cant you see what you are doing to me
Cant you see what you have done
As I try to pass another long and sleepless night
A hundred crazy voices call my name
As I try to pass them by
I almost can believe that she is here
Here in the glow of the night
Do you know what you have done
Do you know what youve begun
Do you see we shall never be together again
All of my life
Lonely people empty rooms
And all the pointless violence silent tombs
Could it be that we shall be together again
Sheets of double glazing help to keep outside the night
Only foreign city sirens can cut through
Nylon sheets and blankets help to minimize the cold
But they cant keep out the chilling sounds
Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming
That she is here with me
Here in the glow of the night
Do you know what you have done
Do you know what youve begun
Do you see we shall never be together again
All of my life
Lonely people empty rooms
And all the pointless violence silent tombs
Could it be that we shall be together again
Could it be that we shall be together again

In silence and darkness
We held each other near that night
We prayed it would last forever
Part 2 The Last Domino
Blood on the windows
Millions of ordinary people are there
They gaze at the scenery
They act as if it is perfectly clear
Take a look at the mountains
Take a look at the beautiful river of blood
The liquid surrounds me
I fight to rise from this river of hell
I stare round about me
And children are swimming and playing with boats
Their features are changing
Their bodies dissolve and I am alone
Now see what youve gone and done
Now see what youve gone and done
Well now you never did see such a terrible thing
As youve seen last night on the TV
Maybe if were lucky they will show it again
Such a terrible thing to see  oh
But theres nothing you can do when youre next in line
Youve got to go domino
Now Im one with the living and Im feeling just fine
I know just what I gotta do
Play the game of happiness and never let on
That it only lives on in a song  oh
Well theres nothing you can do when youre next in line
Youve got to go domino
Do you know what you have done
And do you know what youve begun
In silence and darkness
Hold each other near tonight
For will it last forever
Will it last forever
Forever
Theres nothing you can do when youre the next in line
Youve got to go domino
Do you know do you know do you know what you have done
Do you see what youve begun
Cos theres nothing nothing nothing
Theres nothing you can do theres nothing you can do
Do you see do you see what you have done
