The path is clear
Though no eyes can see
The course laid down long before
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Though many times theyve seen the way to leave
He rides majestic
Past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy
To see reflected there
The trees the sky the lily fair
The scene of death is lying just below
The mountain cuts off the town from view
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill
Let it be revealed
A waterfall his madrigal
An inland sea his symphony
Na na na na na
Na na
Undinal songs
Urge the sailors on
Til lured by the sirens cry
Now as the river dissolves in sea
So Neptune has claimed another soul
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Until the shepherd leads his flock away
The sands of time were eroded by
The river of constant change
