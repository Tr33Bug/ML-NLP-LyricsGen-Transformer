Stay with me
My love I hope youll always be
Right here by my side if ever I need you
Oh my love
In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
And every day is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you
I will follow you will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year
With the dark
Oh I see so very clearly now
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away
I can say
The night is long but you are here
Close at hand oh Im better for the smile you give
And while I live I will
Follow you will you
Follow me all the days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year there will be


I will follow you will you
Follow me All the
Days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year I will
Follow you will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year I will
Follow you will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year
