Get em out by Friday
You dont get paid till the last ones well on his way
Get em out by Friday
Its important that we keep to schedule there must be no delay
I represent a firm of gentlemen who recently purchased this house and all the others in the road
In the interest of humanity weve found a better place for you to gogogo
Oh no this I cant believe
Oh Mary theyre asking us to leave
Get em out by Friday
Ive told you before s good money gone if we let them stay
And if it isnt easy
You can squeeze a little grease and our troubles will soon run away
After all this time they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent
I dont know why it seemed so funny
Seeing as how theyd take more money
The winkler called again he came here this morning
With four hundred pounds and a photograph of the place he has found
A block of flats with central heating
I think were going to find it hard
Now weve got them
Ive always said that cash cash cash can do anything well
Work can be rewarding
When a flash of intuition is a gift that helps you excelsellsellsell
Here we are in Harlow New Town did you recognise your block
Across the square over there
Sadly since last time we spoke weve found weve had to raise the rent again
Just a bit
Oh no this I cant believe
Oh Mary and we agreed to leave
This is an announcement from Genetic Control
It is my sad duty to inform you of a four foot restriction on
Humanoid height
I hear the directors of Genetic Control have been buying all the
Properties that have recently been sold taking risks oh so bold
Its said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
they say its alright 
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity theyve been told they must go
Told they must gogogogo
I think Ive fixed a new deal
A dozen properties  well buy at five and sell at thirty four
Some are still inhabited
Its time to send the winkler to see them
Hell have to work some more
With land in your hand youll be happy on earth
Then invest in the Church for your heaven
