Home by the Sea
Home by the Sea
Home by the Sea
Home by the Sea
Creeping up the blind side shinning up the wall
Stealing through the dark of night
Climbing through a window stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces putting them away
Something doesnt feel quite right
Help me someone let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea
Coming out the woodwork through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows but no substance in the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sigh and they moan
Help us someone let us out of here
Living here so long on this Earth
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea
Sit down sit down
Sit down sit down sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Images of sorrow pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone let us out of here
Cause living here so long on this Earth
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the Home by the Sea
Sit down sit down
Sit down sit down sit down sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you
Sit down sit down sit down
Cause you wont get away no with us you will stay
For the rest of your days sit down
As we relive our lives in what we tell you
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you
