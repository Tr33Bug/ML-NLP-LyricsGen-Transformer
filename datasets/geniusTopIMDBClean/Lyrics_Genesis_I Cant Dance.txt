Hot sun beatin down
Burnin my feet just walkin around
Hot sun makin me sweat
Gators gettin close hasnt got me yet
I cant dance I cant talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I cant dance I cant sing
Im just standin here sellin everything
Blue jeans sittin on the beach
Her dogs talkin to me but shes out of reach
Shes got a body under that shirt
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt
Cause I cant dance I cant talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I cant dance I cant sing
Im just standin here sellin
Oh and checkin everything is in place
You never know whos lookin on
Young punk spillin beer on my shoes
Fat guys talkin to me tryna steal my blues
Thick smoke see her smilin through
I never thought so much could happen just shootin pool
But I cant dance I cant talk
The only thing about me is the way that I walk
I cant dance I cant sing
Im just standin here sellin


Oh and checkin everything is in place
You never know whos lookin on
A perfect body with a perfect face mhm
No I cant dance I cant talk
The only thing about me is the way I walk
No I cant dance I cant sing
Im just standin here sellin everything
But I can walk
No I cant dance
Nonono I cant dance
No I said I cant sing
But I can walk
