I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe) Lyrics
It's one o'clock and time for lunch
Bum-de-dum, de-dum
When the sun beats down, and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk

There's always been Ethel
"Jacob, wake up, you've got to tidy your room now!"
And then Mister Lewis
"Isn't it time that he was out on his own?"
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds, cuckoo to you
Keep them mowing blades sharp
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show, your show

Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na

Sunday night, Mr. Farmer called
Said, "Listen, son, you're wasting time
There's a future for you in the fire escape trade
Come up to town"
But I remembered the voice from the past
"Gambling only pays when you're winning!"
I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure
Keep them mowing blades sharp

I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show, yeah
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show
You might also like
When the sun beats down, and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk
Me? I'm just a lawnmower
You can tell me by the way I walk6Embed
