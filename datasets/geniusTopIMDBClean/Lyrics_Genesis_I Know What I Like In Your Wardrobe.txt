I Know What I Like  In Your Wardrobe  Lyrics
Its one oclock and time for lunch
Bumdedum dedum
When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk
Theres always been Ethel
Jacob wake up youve got to tidy your room now
And then Mister Lewis
Isnt it time that he was out on his own
Over the garden wall two little lovebirds cuckoo to you
Keep them mowing blades sharp
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show your show
Dada dadada
Dada dadada
Nana nanana
Nana nanana
Sunday night Mr Farmer called
Said Listen son youre wasting time
Theres a future for you in the fire escape trade
Come up to town
But I remembered the voice from the past
Gambling only pays when youre winning
I had to thank old Miss Mort for schooling a failure
Keep them mowing blades sharp
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show yeah
I know what I like
And I like what I know
Getting better in your wardrobe
Stepping one beyond your show
When the sun beats down and I lie on the bench
I can always hear them talk
Me Im just a lawnmower
You can tell me by the way I walk
