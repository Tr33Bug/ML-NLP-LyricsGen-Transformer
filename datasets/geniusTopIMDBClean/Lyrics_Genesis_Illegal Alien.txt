Illegal Alien LyricsGot out of bed, wasn't feeling too good
With my wallet and my passport, a new pair of shoes
The sun is shining so I head for the park
With a bottle of Tequila, and a new pack of cigarettes
I got a cousin and she got a friend
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help
At his apartment I knocked on the door
He wouldn't come out until he got paid
Now don't tell anybody what I wanna do
If they find out you know that they'll never let me through
Cos it's no fun being an illegal alien
No, it's no fun being an illegal alien
Down at the office had to fill out the forms
A pink one, a red one, the colours you choose
Up to the counter to see what they think
They said 'It doesn't count man, it ain't written in ink'
I don't trust anybody, least not around here, cos
It's no fun being an illegal alien, I tell ya
It's no fun being an illegal alien, no no no no no
It's no fun being an illegal alien, I mean it when I tell ya that
It's no fun being an illegal alien
An illegal alien, okay
Consideration for your fellow man
Would not hurt anybody, it sure fits in with my plan
Over the border, there lies the promised land
Where everything comes easy, you just hold out your hand
Keep your suspicions, I've seen that look before
But I ain't done nothing wrong now
Is that such a surprise?
But I've got a sister who'd be willing to oblige
She will do anything now to help me get to the outside

If they find out you know that they'll never let me through
It's no fun being an illegal alien, I tell ya
It's no fun being an illegal alien, and it's getting me down
It's no fun being an illegal alien, no no no no no
It's no fun being an illegal alien, yeah yeah yeah
It's no fun (it's not much fun) being an illegal alien, I tell ya that
It's no fun being an illegal alien, I tell ya
It's no fun being an illegal alien, no no no no
It's no fun (it's not much fun) being an illegal alien, no no no
It's no fun (it's not bloody much fun) being an illegal alien
It's no fun being an illegal alien, and that's what I am1Embed
