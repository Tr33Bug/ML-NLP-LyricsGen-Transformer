Got out of bed wasnt feeling too good
With my wallet and my passport a new pair of shoes
The sun is shining so I head for the park
With a bottle of Tequila and a new pack of cigarettes
I got a cousin and she got a friend
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help
At his apartment I knocked on the door
He wouldnt come out until he got paid
Now dont tell anybody what I wanna do
If they find out you know that theyll never let me through
Cos its no fun being an illegal alien
No its no fun being an illegal alien
Down at the office had to fill out the forms
A pink one a red one the colours you choose
Up to the counter to see what they think
They said It doesnt count man it aint written in ink
I dont trust anybody least not around here cos
Its no fun being an illegal alien I tell ya
Its no fun being an illegal alien no no no no no
Its no fun being an illegal alien I mean it when I tell ya that
Its no fun being an illegal alien
An illegal alien okay
Consideration for your fellow man
Would not hurt anybody it sure fits in with my plan
Over the border there lies the promised land
Where everything comes easy you just hold out your hand
Keep your suspicions Ive seen that look before
But I aint done nothing wrong now
Is that such a surprise
But Ive got a sister whod be willing to oblige
She will do anything now to help me get to the outside
So dont tell anybody what I wanna do
If they find out you know that theyll never let me through
Its no fun being an illegal alien I tell ya
Its no fun being an illegal alien and its getting me down
Its no fun being an illegal alien no no no no no
Its no fun being an illegal alien yeah yeah yeah
Its no fun  its not much fun  being an illegal alien I tell ya that
Its no fun being an illegal alien I tell ya
Its no fun being an illegal alien no no no no
Its no fun  its not much fun  being an illegal alien no no no
Its no fun  its not bloody much fun  being an illegal alien
Its no fun being an illegal alien and thats what I am
