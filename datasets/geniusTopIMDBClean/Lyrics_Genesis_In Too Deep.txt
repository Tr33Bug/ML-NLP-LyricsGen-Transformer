All that time I was searching with nowhere to run to
It started me thinking wondering
What I could make of my life and whod be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening
All this time I still remember everything you said
Theres so much you promised how could I ever forget
Listen you know I love you but I just cant take this
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps
Although I need you Im not gonna make this
You know I want to but Im in too deep
So listen listen to me
Ooh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I dont know why
Ooh I know youre going but I cant believe
Its the way that youre leaving
Its like we never knew each other at all it may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons being alone when I didnt want to
I thought youd always be there I almost believed you
All this time I still remember everything you said oh
Theres so much you promised how could I ever forget
Listen you know I love you but I just cant take this
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps
Although I need you Im not gonna make this
You know I want to but Im in too deep
So listen listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me
It seems Ive spent too long
Only thinking about myself oh
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else
Listen you know I love you but I just cant take this
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps
Although I need you Im not gonna make this
You know I want to but Im in too deep
You know I love you but I just cant take this
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps
Although I need you Im not gonna make this
You know I want to but Im in too deep
You know I love you but I just cant take this
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps
Although I need you Im not gonna make this
You know I want to but Im in too deep
You know I love you but I just cant take this
