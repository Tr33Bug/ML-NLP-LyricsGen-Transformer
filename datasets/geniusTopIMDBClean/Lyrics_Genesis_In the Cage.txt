I got sunshine in my stomach
Like I just rocked my baby to sleep
I got sunshine in my stomach
But I cant keep me from creeping sleep
Sleep deep in the deep
Rock face moves to press my skin
White liquids turn sour within
Turn fast turn sour turn sweat turn sour
Must tell myself that Im not here
Im drowning in a liquid fear
Bottled in a strong compression
My distortion shows obsession
In the cave get me out of this cave
If I keep selfcontrol
Ill be safe in my soul
And the childhood belief
Brings a moments relief
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns
My spirit just never learns
Stalactites stalagmites
Shut me in lock me tight
Lips are dry throat is dry
Feel like burning stomach churning
Im dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room
Body stretching feel the retching
In the cage get me out of this cage
In the glare of a light
I see a strange kind of sight
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person cant go very far
All tied to their things
They are netted by their strings
Free to flutter in memories
Of their wasted wings
Outside the cage I see my brother John
He turns his head so slowly round
I cry out Help before he can be gone
And he looks at me without a sound
And I shout out John please help me
But he does not even want to try to speak
Im helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek
And I watch him turn again and leave the cage
My little runaway
Raindrops keep falling on my head 
They keep falling on my 
Raindrops keep falling on my head 
They keep falling on my 
Raindrops keep falling on my head 
They keep falling on my 
In a trap feel a strap
Holding still pinned for kill
Chances narrow that Ill make it
In the cushioned straight jacket
Just like 22nd Street
When they got me by my neck and feet
Pressures building cant take more
My headaches charge earaches roar
In this pain get me out of this pain
If I could change to liquid
I could fill the cracks up in the rocks
But I know that I am solid
And I am my own bad luck
Outside John disappears
And my cage dissolves
Without any reason
My body revolves
Keep on turning keep on turning
Keep on turning keep on turning
Keep on turning turning around
Just spinning around
Round round round round
Round round round round
