Well Ive been waiting waiting here so long
But thinking nothing nothing could go wrong ooh now I know
She has a builtin ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems Im falling falling for her
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart
Well I dont really know her I only know her name
But when she crawls under your skin
Youre never quite the same and now I know
Shes got something you just cant trust
Its something mysterious
And now it seems Im falling falling for her
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart
Well she dont like losing to her its still a game
And though she will mess up your life
Youll want her just the same and now I know
She has a builtin ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems Ive fallen fallen for her


She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
