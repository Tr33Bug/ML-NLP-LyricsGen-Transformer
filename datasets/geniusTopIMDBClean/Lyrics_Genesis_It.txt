It Lyrics
When it's cold, it come slow
It is warm, just watch it grow
All around me

It is here, it is now

Just a little bit of it
Can bring you up or down
Like the supper, it is cooking
In your hometown
It is chicken, it is eggs
It is in between your legs
It is walking on the moon
Leaving your cocoon
It is the jigsaw, it is purple haze
It never stays in one place
But it's not a passing phase
It is in the singles bar
In the distance of the face
It is in between the cages
It is always in a space

It is here, it is now

Any rock can be made to roll
If you've enough of it to pay the toll
It has no home in words or goal
Not even in your favorite hole
It is the hope for the dope
Who rides the horse without a hoof
It is shaken, not stirred
Cocktails on the roof

When you eat right through it
You see everything alive
It is inside spirit
With enough grit to survive
If you think that it's pretentious
You've been taken for a ride
Look across the mirror, sonny
Before you choose, decide
You might also like
It is here, it is now

It is real
It is Rael
'Cause it's only knock and know all
But I like it
Yes, it's only knock and know all
But l like it
Yes, it's only knock and know all
But l like it, like it, like it, like it
It's only knock and know all
But l like it, like it, like it
(It's only knock and know all)
(But l like it)
(It's only knock and know all)
(And l like it...)1Embed
