When its cold it come slow
It is warm just watch it grow
All around me
It is here it is now
Just a little bit of it
Can bring you up or down
Like the supper it is cooking
In your hometown
It is chicken it is eggs
It is in between your legs
It is walking on the moon
Leaving your cocoon
It is the jigsaw it is purple haze
It never stays in one place
But its not a passing phase
It is in the singles bar
In the distance of the face
It is in between the cages
It is always in a space
It is here it is now
Any rock can be made to roll
If youve enough of it to pay the toll
It has no home in words or goal
Not even in your favorite hole
It is the hope for the dope
Who rides the horse without a hoof
It is shaken not stirred
Cocktails on the roof
When you eat right through it
You see everything alive
It is inside spirit
With enough grit to survive
If you think that its pretentious
Youve been taken for a ride
Look across the mirror sonny
Before you choose decide
It is here it is now
It is real
It is Rael
Cause its only knock and know all
But I like it
Yes its only knock and know all
But l like it
Yes its only knock and know all
But l like it like it like it like it
Its only knock and know all
But l like it like it like it
Its only knock and know all 
But l like it 
Its only knock and know all 
And l like it
