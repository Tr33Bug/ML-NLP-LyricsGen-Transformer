Dyou see the face on the TV screen
Coming at you every Sunday
See the face on the billboard
Well that man is me
On the cover of a magazine
Theres no question why Im smiling
You buy a piece of paradise you buy a piece of me
Ill get you everything you wanted
Ill get you everything you need
You dont need to believe in hereafter
Just believe in me
Cause Jesus he knows me
And he knows Im right
Ive been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes he knows me
And he knows Im right
Well hes been telling me everything is alright
I believe in the family
With my everloving wife beside me
But she dont know about my girlfriend
Or the man I met last night
Do you believe in God
Cause that is what Im selling
And if you wanna get to heaven
Well Ill see you right
You wont even have to leave your house
Or get out of your chair
You dont even have to touch that dial
Cause Im everywhere
Jesus he knows me
And he knows Im right
Ive been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes he knows me
And he knows Im right
Well hes been telling me everythings gonna be alright
Wont find me practicing what Im preaching
Wont find me making no sacrifice
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
If you promise to be good try to be nice
God will take good care of you
Well just do as I say dont do as I do
Well Im counting my blessings
As Ive found true happiness
Cause Im agetting richer
Day by day
You can find me in the phone book
Just call my tollfree number
You can do it any way you want
Just do it right away
And therell be no doubt in your mind
Youll believe everything Im saying
If you wanna get closer to Him
Get on your knees and start paying
Cause Jesus he knows me
And he knows Im right
Ive been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes he knows me
And he knows Im right
Well hes been telling me everythings gonna be alright
Cause Jesus he knows me
And he knows Im right
Jesus he knows he knows
Ooh yes he knows me
And he knows Im right
Jesus he knows he knows
Ive been talking to Jesus
All my life
Well hes been telling me everythings gonna be alright
