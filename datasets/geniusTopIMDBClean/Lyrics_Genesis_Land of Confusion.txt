I mustve dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
Theyre moving into the street
Now did you read the news today
They say the dangers gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
Theyre burning into the night
Theres too many men too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Cant you see this is a land of confusion
This is the world we live in  Oh oh oh 
And these are the hands were given  Oh oh oh 
Use them and lets start trying  Oh oh oh 
To make it a place worth living in
Ooh Superman where are you now
When everythings gone wrong somehow
The men of steel the men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time this is the place
So we look for the future
But theres not much love to go round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion
This is the world we live in  Oh oh oh 
And these are the hands were given  Oh oh oh 
Use them and lets start trying  Oh oh oh 
To make it a place worth living in
I remember long ago
Ooh when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago
I wont be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
Were not just making promises
That we know well never keep
Too many men theres too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Cant you see this is a land of confusion
Now this is the world we live in  Oh oh oh 
And these are the hands were given  Oh oh oh 
Use them and lets start trying  Oh oh oh 
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in  Oh oh oh 
And these are the names were given  Oh oh oh 
Stand up and lets start showing  Oh oh oh 
Just where our lives are going to
