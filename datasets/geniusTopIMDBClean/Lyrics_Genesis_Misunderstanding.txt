There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours
You were late
Now its not like me to say the right thing
But you couldve called to let me know
I checked your number twice dont understand it
So I went home
Well Id been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed Id have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
Thats why I dont know why
You didnt show up that night
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours
You were late
Since then Ive been running around trying to find you
I went to the places that you always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car I went round there
I still dont believe it
He was just leaving
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
