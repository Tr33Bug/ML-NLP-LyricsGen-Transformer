Here am I
Who while away the mornings
Since youve gone
Too long have I lay alone
Not knowing which way to turn
And there you are
Quite sure that you were right
Knowing full well
That Id be the first one to go down
And youd be the one who was laughing
Except when things werent going your way
And then the lady would say that shed had enough
Wandering around on her own
The day you left
Well I think you knew youd not be back
Well at least it would seem that way
Because you never said goodbye
But when it comes round to you and me
Im sure it will work out alright
And youd be the one who was laughing
And giving me something I dont need
And you know Id always hold you and keep you warm
Oh more fool me
Ah but when it comes
Round to you and me
I ask myself Do I really believe in your love
Yes Im sure it will work out alright
