The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine
I didnt think much about it
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night
I couldnt stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that that would be the
Last theyd see of me
And I never went home again
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what hed say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said
Youre no son no son of mine
Youre no son no son of mine
You walked out you left us behind
And youre no son no son of mine
Oh his words how they hurt me Ill never forget it
And as the time it went by I lived to regret it
Youre no son no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
Youre no son no son of mine
But I came here for help I came here for you
Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away
In and out of hiding places
Soon Id have to face the facts
Wed have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what hed say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said
Youre no son no son of mine
Youre no son no son of mine
You walked out you left us behind
And youre no son no son of mine
Oh his words how they hurt me Ill never forget it
And as the time it went by I lived to regret it
Youre no son no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
Youre no son no son of mine
But I came here for help I came here for you
Youre no son no son of mine
Youre no son
Youre no son
Youre no son
Youre no son
No son
No son
No son
Youre no son
No son
No son
Youre no son of mine
