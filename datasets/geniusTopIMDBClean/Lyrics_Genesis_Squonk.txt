Like father like son
Not flesh nor fish nor bone
A red rag hangs from an open mouth
Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle
A tumbling and a bumbling he will go
All the Kings horses and all the Kings men
Could never put a smile on that face
Hes a sly one hes a shy one wouldnt you be too
Scared to be left out on his own
He hasnt a hasnt a friend to play with the ugly duckling
The pressure on the bubble will burst before our eyes
And all the while in perfect time
His tears are falling on the ground
But if you dont stand up you dont stand a chance
You dont stand a chance
Go a little faster now
You might get there in time
Mirror mirror on the wall
His heart was broken long before he ever came to you
Stop your tears from falling
The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night
All to see at night
They come at night
In season out of season
Oh whats the difference when you dont know the reason
In one hand bread the other a stone
The hunter enters the forest
But all are not huntsmen who blow the huntsmans horn
And by the look of this one youve not got much to fear
Here I am Im very fierce and frightning
I come to match my skill to yours
Now listen here listen to me dont you run away now
I am a friend Id really like to play with you
Making noises my little furry friend would make
Ill trick him then Ill kick him into my sack
You better watch out you better watch out
Ive got you Ive got you
Youll never get away
Walking home that night
The sack across my back
The sound of sobbing on my shoulder
When suddenly it stopped
I opened up the sack all that I had
A pool of bubbles and tears just a pool of tears
Just a pool of tears
All in all you are a very dying race
Placing trust upon a cruel world
You never had the things you thought you shouldve had
And youll not get them now
And all the while in perfect time
Your tears are falling on the ground
