Walking across the sittingroom I turn the television off
Sitting beside you I look into your eyes
As the sound of motor cars fades in the nighttime
I swear I saw your face change it didnt seem quite right
And its Hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true
Coming closer with our eyes a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And its Hey babe your suppers waiting for you
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true
Ive been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
Its good to feel you again
Its been a long long time
Hasnt it
I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire


You cant you see hes fooled you all
Yes hes here again
Cant you see hes fooled you all
Share his peace sign the lease
Hes a supersonic scientist
Hes a guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life youll walk inside
Hand in hand gland in gland
With a spoonful of miracle
Hes the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you rock you little snake 
We will keep you snug and warm 
Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of darkskinned warriors
Standing still below the ground
Waiting for battle
Fights begun theyve been released
Killing foe for peace
Bang bang bang bang bang bang
And theyre giving me a wonderful potion
Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though Im feeling good
Something tells me Id better activate my prayer capsule
Todays a day to celebrate the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord
Wandering through the chaos the battle has left
We climb up a mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
Hes been stamped Human Bacon by some butchery tool
He is you
Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower 
If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies or flutterbyes or gutterflies
Open your eyes its full of surprise everyone lies
Like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh theres mum and dad and good and bad
And everyones happy to be here
Theres Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag plastic bag what a drag
The frog was a prince the prince was a brick the brick was an egg
The egg was a bird
Fly away you sweet little thing 
Theyre hard on your tail 
Havent you heard
Theyre going to change you 
Into a human being 
Yes were happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning
Weve got everything were growing everything
Weve got some in weve got some out
Weve got some wild things floating about
Everyone were changing everyone
You name them all weve had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
All change 
Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad
Daddiddleyoffice daddiddleyoffice
Youre all full of ball
Dad to dam to dum to mum
Mumdiddleywashing mumdiddleywashing
Woo youre all full of ball
Let me hear your lies
Were living this up to the eyes
Ooh ah nanana
Mama I want you now
And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors tidy floors more applause
Youve been here all the time
Like it or not like what you got
Youre under the soil  The soil the soil 
Yes deep in the soil  The soil the soil the soil the soil 
So well end with a whistle and end with a bang
And all of us fit in our places
With the guards of Magog swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell hes doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise it wont be easy
666 is no longer below
Hes getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing
Sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood hes writing the lyrics of a brandnew tune
And its Hey babe with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby dont you know our love is true
Ive been so far from here
Far from your loving arms
Now Im back again and babe its gonna work out fine
Cant you feel our souls ignite
Shedding everchanging colours in the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean as the germ in a seed grows
Weve finally been freed to get back home
Theres an angel standing in the sun
And hes crying with a loud voice
This is the supper of the mighty one
Lord of lords king of kings
Has returned to lead his children home
To take them to the new Jerusalem
