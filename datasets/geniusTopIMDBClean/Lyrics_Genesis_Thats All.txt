Just as I thought it was goin alright
I found out Im wrong when I thought I was right
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
I could say day and youd say night
Tell me its black when I know that its white
Always the same its just a shame and thats all
I could leave but I wont go though my heart might tell me so
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me lookin at you you lookin at me
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
Turnin me on turnin me off
Makin me feel like I want too much
Livin with yous just aputtin me through it all of the time
Runnin around stayin out all night
Takin it all instead of takin one bite
Livin with yous just aputtin me through it all of the time
I could leave but I wont go but itd be easier I know
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes
But why does it always seem to be
Me lookin at you you lookin at me
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
Truth is I love you more than I wanted to
Theres no point in tryin to pretend
Theres been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say well be together til the end
But I could leave but I wont go itd be easier I know
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes
So why does it always seem to be
Me lookin at you you lookin at me
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
But I love you more than I wanted to
Theres no point in tryin to pretend
Theres been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say well be together til the end
But just as I thought it was goin alright
I found out Im wrong when I thought I was right
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
Well I could say day and youd say night
You tell me its black when I know that its white
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
Thats all
