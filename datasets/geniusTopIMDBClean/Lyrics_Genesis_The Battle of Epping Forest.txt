Along the Forest Road theres hundreds of cars  luxury cars
Each has got its load of convertible bars cutlery cars  superscars
For today is the day when they sort it out sort it out
Cause they disagree on a gangland boundary
They disagree on a gangland boundary
Theres Willy Wright and his boys 
One helluva noise thats Billys boys
With fullyfashioned bugs thats Little Johns thugs
The Barking Slugs  supersmugs
For today is the day when they sort it out sort it out
Yes these Christian soldiers fight to protect the poor
East end heroes got to score in
The Battle of Epping Forest
Yes its the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
And you aint seen nothing like it
No you aint seen nothing like it
Not since the Civil War
Coming over the hill are the boys of Bill
And Johnnys lads stand very still
With the thumpires shout they all start to clout
Theres no guns in this gentlemans bout
Georgie moves in on the outside left
With a chain flying round his head
And Harold Demure from Art Literature
Nips up the nearest tree
Here come the cavalry 
Amidst the battle roar
Accountants keep the score 104
Theyve never been alone after getting a radiophone
The bluebells are ringing for Sweetmeal Sam real ham
Handing out bread and jam just like any picnic
Picnic  Picnic  Picnic


Its 5 to 4 on William Wright he made his pile on Derby night
When Billy was a kid walking the streets
The other kids hid  so they did
And now after working hard in security trade hes got it made
The shops that need aid are those that havent paid
Ill do my doubleshow quick
Said Mick the Prick fresh out the nick
I sell cheap holiday The minute they leave
And a visit I pay  does it pay
And his friend Liquid Len by name
Of Wine Women and Wandsworth fame
Said Im breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed
Im breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed
Got me framed
They called me the Reverend when I entered the Church unstained
My employers have changed but the name has remained
It all began when I went on a tour
Hoping to find some furniture
Followed a sign saying Beautiful Chest
It led to a lady who showed me her best
She was taken by surprise when I quickly closed my eyes
So she rang the bell and quick as hell
Bob the Nob came out on his job
To see what the trouble was
Louise is the Reverend hard to please
Youre telling me
Perhaps sir if its not too late
We could interest you in our oldfashioned Staffordshire plate
Oh no not me Im a man of repute
But the Devil caught hold of my soul and a voice called out Shoot
To save my steeple I visited people
For this Id gone when I met Little John
His name came I understood
When the judge said You are a robbing hood
He told me of his strange foundation
Conceived in sight of the Woodstock nation
Hed had to hide his reputation
When poor twas salvation from door to door
But now with a pinup guru every week
It was Love Peace  Truth Incorporated for all who seek
He employed me as a karmamamechanic with overall charms
His hands were then fit to receive receive alms
Thats why were in the Battle of Epping Forest
Yes its the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
We guard your souls for peanuts
And we guard your shops and houses
For just a little more just a little more
In with a left hook is the Bethnal Green Butcher
But hes countered on the right by Micks chaingang fight
And Liquid Len with his smashed bottle men
Is lobbing Bob the Nob across the gob
With his kisser in a mess Bob seems under stress
But Jones the Jug hits Len right in the mug
And Harold Demure whos still not quite sure
Fires acorns from out of his sling
Here come the cavalry 
Up up above the crowd
Inside their Silver Cloud done proud
The bold and brazen brass seen darkly through the glass
The butlers got jam on his Rolls Roy doles out the lot
With tea from a silver pot just like any picnic
Picnic  Picnic  Picnic
Along the Forest Road its the end of the day
And the Clouds roll away
Each has got its load  theyll come out for the count
At the breakin of day
When the limos return for their final review its all thru
all they can see is the morning goo
Theres noone left alive  must be a draw
So the Blackcap Barons toss a coin to settle the score
