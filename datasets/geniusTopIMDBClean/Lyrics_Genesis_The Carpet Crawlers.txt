There is lambswool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries
Into flame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures
Are trapped in birth on celluloid
The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping theyll find peace
Each thought and gesture
Are caught in celluloid
Theres no hiding in my memory
Theres no room to avoid
The crawlers cover the floor
In the red ochre corridor
For my second sight of people
Theyve more lifeblood than before
Theyre moving in time
To a heavy wooden door
Where the needles eye is winking
Closing on the poor
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Theres only one direction
In the faces that I see
Its upward to the ceiling
Where the chambers said to be
Like the forest fight for sunlight
That takes root in every tree
They are pulled up by the magnet
Believing theyre free


The carpet crawlers heed their callers
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Mildmannered supermen
Are held in kryptonite
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle
With their bodies glowing bright
Through the door a harvest feast
Is lit by candlelight
Its the bottom of a staircase
That spirals out of sight
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
The porcelain mannequin
With shattered skin fears attack
And the eager pack lift up their pitchers
They carry all they lack
The liquid has congealed
Which has seeped out through the crack
And the tickler takes his stickleback
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
The carpet crawlers heed their callers
Weve got to get in to get out
Weve got to get in to get out
