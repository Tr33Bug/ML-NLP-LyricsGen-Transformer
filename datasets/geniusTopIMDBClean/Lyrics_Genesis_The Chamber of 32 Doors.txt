At the top of the stairs theres hundreds of people
Running around to all the doors
They try to find find themselves an audience
Their deductions need applause
The rich man stands in front of me
The poor man behind my back
They believe they can control the game
But the juggler holds another pack
I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust
I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust
Id rather trust a countryman than a town man
You can judge by his eyes take a look if you can
Hell smile through his guard survival trains hard
Id rather trust a man who works with his hands
He looks at you once you know he understands
Dont need any shield when youre out in the field
But down here
Im so alone with my fear
With everything that I hear
And every single door
That Ive walked through
Brings me back back here again
Ive got to find my own way
The priest and the magician
Singing all the chants that they have ever heard
And theyre all calling out my name
Even academics searching printed word
My father to the left of me
My mother to the right
Like everyone else theyre pointing
But nowhere feels quite right
And I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust
I need someone to believe in
Someone to trust
Id rather trust a man who doesnt shout what hes found
Theres no need to sell if youre homeward bound
If I choose a side he wont take me for a ride
Back inside
This chamber of so many doors
Ive nowhere nowhere to hide
Id give you all of my dreams
If youd help me
Find a door
That doesnt lead me back again
Take me away
