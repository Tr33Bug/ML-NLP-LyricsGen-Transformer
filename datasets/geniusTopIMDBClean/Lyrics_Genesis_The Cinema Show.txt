Home from work our Juliet
Clears her morning meal
She dabs her skin with pretty smells
Concealing to appeal
I will make my bed
She said but turned to go
Can she be late for her cinema show
Cinema show
Romeo locks his basement flat
And scurries up the stair
With head held high and floral tie
A weekend millionaire
I will make my bed
With her tonight he cries
Can he fail armed with his chocolate surprise
Take a little trip back with father Tiresias
Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through
I have crossed between the poles for me theres no mystery
Once a man like the sea I raged
Once a woman like the earth I gave
But there is in fact more earth than sea
Take a little trip back with father Tiresias
Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through
I have crossed between the poles for me theres no mystery
Once a man like the sea I raged
Once a woman like the earth I gave
But there is in fact more earth than sea
