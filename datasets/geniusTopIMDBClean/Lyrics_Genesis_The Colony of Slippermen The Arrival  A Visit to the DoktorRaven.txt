The Colony of Slippermen (The Arrival / A Visit to the Doktor/Raven) LyricsI. “The Arrival”
Bubbity-bup

I wandered lonely as a cloud
Till I came upon this dirty street
I've never seen a stranger crowd
Slubberdegullions on squeaky feet
Continually pacing
With nonchalant embracing
Each orifice disgracing
One facing me moves to say, “Hellay”
His skin's all covered in slimy lumps
With lips that slide across each chin
His twisted limbs like rubber stumps
Are waved in welcome, say, “Please join in”
My grip must be flipping
Cause his handshake keeps slipping
My hopes keep on dipping
And his lips keep on smiling all the time

“We, like you, have tasted love
Don't be alarmed at what you see
You yourself are just the same
As what you see in me”

“Me? Like you? Like that?”

“You better watch it, son
Your sentence has only just begun
You better run and join your brother John”
II. “A Visit to the Doctor”
“You're in the colony of Slippermen!
There's no who, why, what, or when?
You get out if you've got the gripe
To see Doctor Dyper, reformed sniper
He'll whip off your windscreen wiper”
John and I are able
To face the Doctor and his marble table
He said, “Understand Rael
That's the end of your tail”
“Don't delay, dock the dick!”
I watch his countdown timer tick
You might also likeIII. “The Raven”
He places the number into a tube
It's a yellow plastic Shoobedoobe
It says, “Though your fingers may tickle
You'll be safe in our pickle”
Suddenly, black cloud come down from the sky
It's a supersized blackbird that sure can fly!

The Raven brings on darkness and night
He flies right down, gives me one hell of a fright
He take the tube right out of my hands
Man, I got to find out where that black bird lands

“Look here John, I got to run
I need you now, you going to come?”
He says to me, “Now can't you see?
Where the Raven flies, there's jeopardy
“We've been cured on the couch
Now you're sick with your grouch
I'll not risk my honey pouch
Which my slouch will wear slung very low”

He walks away and leaves me once again
Even though I never learn
I'd hoped he'd show just some concern
Some concern
Ah-ah, some concern

I'm in the agony of Slipper pain
I pray my undercarriage will sustain
The chase is on, the pace is hot
But I'm running so very hard
With everything that I've got
He leads me down an underpass
Though it narrows, he still flies very fast
When the tunnel stops
Catch sight of the tube, just as it drops
I'm on top of a bank too steep to climb
I see it hit the water

Just in time
To watch it float away
Watch it float away
Watch it float away
Ache, make, lake, slake
Wake, snake…Embed
