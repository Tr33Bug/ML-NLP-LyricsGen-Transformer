The Colony of Slippermen  The Arrival  A Visit to the DoktorRaven  LyricsI The Arrival
Bubbitybup
I wandered lonely as a cloud
Till I came upon this dirty street
Ive never seen a stranger crowd
Slubberdegullions on squeaky feet
Continually pacing
With nonchalant embracing
Each orifice disgracing
One facing me moves to say Hellay
His skins all covered in slimy lumps
With lips that slide across each chin
His twisted limbs like rubber stumps
Are waved in welcome say Please join in
My grip must be flipping
Cause his handshake keeps slipping
My hopes keep on dipping
And his lips keep on smiling all the time
We like you have tasted love
Dont be alarmed at what you see
You yourself are just the same
As what you see in me
Me Like you Like that
You better watch it son
Your sentence has only just begun
You better run and join your brother John
II A Visit to the Doctor
Youre in the colony of Slippermen
Theres no who why what or when
You get out if youve got the gripe
To see Doctor Dyper reformed sniper
Hell whip off your windscreen wiper
John and I are able
To face the Doctor and his marble table
He said Understand Rael
Thats the end of your tail
Dont delay dock the dick
I watch his countdown timer tick
III The Raven
He places the number into a tube
Its a yellow plastic Shoobedoobe
It says Though your fingers may tickle
Youll be safe in our pickle
Suddenly black cloud come down from the sky
Its a supersized blackbird that sure can fly
The Raven brings on darkness and night
He flies right down gives me one hell of a fright
He take the tube right out of my hands
Man I got to find out where that black bird lands
Look here John I got to run
I need you now you going to come
He says to me Now cant you see
Where the Raven flies theres jeopardy
Weve been cured on the couch
Now youre sick with your grouch
Ill not risk my honey pouch
Which my slouch will wear slung very low
He walks away and leaves me once again
Even though I never learn
Id hoped hed show just some concern
Some concern
Ahah some concern
Im in the agony of Slipper pain
I pray my undercarriage will sustain
The chase is on the pace is hot
But Im running so very hard
With everything that Ive got
He leads me down an underpass
Though it narrows he still flies very fast
When the tunnel stops
Catch sight of the tube just as it drops
Im on top of a bank too steep to climb
I see it hit the water
Just in time
To watch it float away
Watch it float away
Watch it float away
Ache make lake slake
Wake snake
