And the lamb lies down on Broadway
Early morning Manhattan
Ocean winds blow on the land
The MoviePalace is now undone
The allnight watchmen have had their fun
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show
Its the same old ending
Time to go get out
It seems they cannot leave their dream
Theres something moving
In the sidewalk steam
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
Nightimes flyers feel their pains
Drugstore takes down the chains
Metal motion comes in bursts
But the gas station can quench that thirst
Suspension cracked on unmade road
The truckers eyes read Overload
And out of the subway
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Exits into daylight spraygun hid
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
The lamb seems right out of place
Yet the Broadway street scene
Finds a focus in its face
Somehow its lying there
Brings a stillness to the air
Though manmade light
At night is very bright
Theres no whitewash victim
As the neons dim to the coat of white
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Wipes his gunhes forgotten what he did
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
Suzanne tired her work all done
Thinks moneyhoneybe onneon
Cabmans velvet glove sounds the horn
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn
Wonder women you can draw your blind
Dont look at me
Im not your kind Im Rael
Something inside me has just begun
Lord knows what I have done
And the lamb lies down on Broadway
On Broadway
They say the lights
Are always bright on Broadway
They say theres always magic in the air
