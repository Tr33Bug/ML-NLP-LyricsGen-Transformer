The Lamia Lyrics
The scent grows richer
He knows he must be near
He finds a long passageway
Lit by chandelier
Each step he takes, the perfumes change
From familiar fragrance to flavors strange
A magnificent chamber meets his eye

Inside, a long rose-water pool
Is shrouded by fine mist
Stepping in the moist silence
With a warm breeze, he's gently kissed
Thinking he is quite alone
He enters the room as if it were his own
But ripples on the sweet pink water
Reveal some company unthought of
Rael stands astonished, doubting his sight
Struck by beauty, gripped in fright
Three vermilion snakes of female face
The smallest motion, filled with grace

Muted melodies
Fill the echoing hall
But there is no sign of warning
In the siren's call

"Rael, welcome
We are the Lamia of the pool
We have been waiting for our waters
To bring you cool”


Putting fear beside him
He trusts in beauty blind
He slips into the nectar
Leaving his shredded clothes behind
With their tongues, they test, taste, and judge
All that is mine
They move in a series of caresses
That glide up and down my spine
You might also like
As they nibble the fruit of my flesh
I feel no pain
Only a magic
That a name would stain
With the first drop of my blood in their veins
Their faces are convulsed in mortal pains
The fairest cries, “We all have loved you, Rael"

Each empty snake-like body floats
Silent sorrow in empty boats
A sickly sourness fills the room
The bitter harvest of a dying bloom

Looking for motion
I know I will not find
I stroke the curls, now turning pale
In which I'd lain entwined

Oh lamia, your flesh that remains
I will take as my food
It is the scent of garlic that lingers
On my chocolate fingers

Looking behind me
The water turns icy-blue
The lights are dimmed, and once again
The stage is set for you
