Play me Old King Cole
That I may join with you
All your hearts now seem so far from me
It hardly seems to matter now
And the nurse will tell you lies
Of a kingdom beyond the skies
But I am lost within this halfworld
It hardly seems to matter now
Play me my song
Here it comes again 
Play me my song
Here it comes again 
La lala lala lala lala 
Just a little bit  La lala lala lala lala 
Just a little bit more time  Lala 
Time left to live out my life  Lala la 
Lala lala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala ah ah
Play me my song
Here it comes again 
Play me my song
Here it comes again 
Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he
So he called for his pipe
And he called for his bowl
And he called for his fiddlers three
But the clock ticktock
On the mantelpiece
And I want and I feel and I know
And I touch her warmth
She is a lady shes got time
Brush back your hair
Shes got time for shes a lady 
And let me get to know your face
She is a lady she is mine
Oh brush back your hair
She is mine she is a lady 
And let me get to know your flesh
Ive been waiting here for so long
And all this time has passed me by
It doesnt seem to matter now
You stand there with your fixed expression
Casting doubt on all I have to say
Why dont you touch me touch me
Why dont you touch me touch me
Touch me now now now now now
Now now now now now
Now now now now now
Now now now now
Now now now now
