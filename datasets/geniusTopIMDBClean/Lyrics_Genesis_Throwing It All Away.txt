Need I say I love you
Need I say I care
Need I say that emotions
Are something we dont share
I dont want to be sitting here
Trying to deceive you
Cause you know I know baby
That I dont wanna go
We can not live together
We can not live apart
And thats the situation
Weve known it from the start
Every time that I look at you
I can see the future
Cause you know I know baby
That I dont wanna go
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turnin upside down
Throwing it all away
Now who will light up your darkness
And who will hold your hand
Who will find you the answers
When you dont understand
Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you
Cause you know I know baby
That I dont wanna go
Then some day youll be sorry
Someday when youre free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound youll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me
Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And theres nothing that I can say
Hey
Were throwing it all away
Just a throwing it all away
Just a throwing it all away
