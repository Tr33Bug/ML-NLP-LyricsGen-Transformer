 One two three four 
All I need is a TV show that and the radio
Down on my luck again down on my luck again
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
Its driving me mad just another way of passing the day
I I get so lonely when shes not there
I I I I
Youre just another face that I know from the TV show
I have known you for so very long I feel you like a friend
Cant you do anything for me can I touch you for a while
Can I meet you on another day and we will fly away
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
Its driving me mad its just another way of passing the day
I I get so lonely when shes not there
I I I
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  I can see another face 
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  I can see another face 
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  I can see another face 
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  I can see another face 
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  I can see another face 
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  I can see another face
