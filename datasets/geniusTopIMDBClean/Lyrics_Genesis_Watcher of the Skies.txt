Watcher of the Skies Lyrics

Watcher of the skies, watcher of all
His is a world alone, no world is his own
He whom life can no longer surprise
Raising his eyes, beholds a planet unknown

Creatures shaped this planet's soil
Now their reign has come to end
Has life again destroyed life?
Do they play elsewhere?
Do they know more than their childhood games?
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth
Judge not this race by empty remains
Do you judge God by his creatures
When they are dead?
For now, the lizard's shed its tail
This is the end of man's long union with Earth

From life alone to life as one
Think not now your journey's done
For though your ship be sturdy
No mercy has the sea
Will you survive on the ocean of being?
Come ancient children, hear what I say
This is my parting counsel for you on your way

Sadly now, your thoughts turn to the stars
Where we have gone
You know you never can go
Watcher of the skies, watcher of all
This is your fate alone, this fate is your ownYou might also likeEmbed
