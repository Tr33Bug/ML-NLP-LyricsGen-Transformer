I try and feel the sunshine you bring the rain
You try and hold me down with your complaints
You cry and moan and complain you whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow the touch you bring
You just dont step inside to to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head thats what I say and you know
Ive been the beggar Ive played the thief
I was the dog they all tried to beat
But its been 14 years of silence
Its been 14 years of pain
Its been 14 years that are gone forever and Ill never have again
Your stupid girlfriends tell you that Im to blame
Well theyre all used up hasbeens out of the game
This time Ill have the last word you hear what I say
I tried to see it your way it wont work today
You just dont step inside to to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head thats what I say you know
Ive been the dealer hangin on your street
I was the dog they all tried to beat
But its been 14 years of silence
Its been 14 years of pain
Its been 14 years that are gone forever and Ill never have again
Bullshit and contemplation gossips their trade
If they knew half the real truth what would they say
Well Im past the point of concern its time to play
These last four years of madness sure put me straight


You dont get back 14 years in just one day
So hard to keep my own head just go away you know
Just like a hooker she said Nothins for free
Oh I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way
