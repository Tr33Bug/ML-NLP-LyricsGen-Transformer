Anything Goes Lyrics
I've been thinking about, thinking 'bout sex
Always hungry for something that I haven't had yet
Well, maybe, baby, you got something to lose
Well, I got something, I got something for you

My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes to

Panties round your knees with your ass in debris
Doing that grind with a push and a squeeze
Tied up, tied down, up against the wall
Be my rubber made, baby, and we can do it all
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes toni-i-i-i-i-ght, yeah-yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight!


My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight, oh yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight-ay-ay-ay-ay, yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Anything goes tonight
Oh woah woah woah, woah...
Said anything goes tonightYou might also like2Embed
