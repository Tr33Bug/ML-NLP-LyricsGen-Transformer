Oh baby
Pretty baby
Oh honey
You let me down honey
I aint playing childhood games no more
I said its time for me to even the score
So stake your claim your claim to fame
But baby call another name
When you feel the fire woah
And taste the flame woah yeah yeah
Back off back off bitch
Down in the gutter dying in the ditch
You better back off back off bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off back off bitch
Back off back off bitch
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Making love cheap heartbreaker
Brokenbacked nasty ballbreaker
Stay outta my bed outta my head
If its loving you Im better off dead
Now back off back off bitch
Down in the gutter dying in the ditch
You better back off back off bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off back off bitch
Back off back off bitch
Woah woah woah
Woah woah woah
Emotions ripped gone on a binge
Light lipped I said youre off the hinge
Telling lies of such fame and glory
I dont even want to hear your story
Back off back off bitch
Down in the gutter dying in the ditch
You better back off back off bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off back off bitch
Its such a pity that youre such a bitch
Back off back off bitch
Its time to burnburn the witch
Back off back off bitch
Back off back off bitch
Back off back off bitch
Back off back off bitch
Bitch bitch bitch bitch

I think its something each persons supposed to take in their own special way
Fucking bitch
