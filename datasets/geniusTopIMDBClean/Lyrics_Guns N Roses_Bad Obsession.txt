I cant stop thinking thinking about sinking
Sinking down into my bed
I call my mother shes just a cunt now
She said Im sick in the head
She said You aint special so who you foolin
Dont try to give me a line
I cant stop thinking bout seein you one more time oh no
But I already left you and youre better off left behind
Its a bad obsession its always messing
Its always messing my mind
Its a bad obsession its always messing
Its always messing my mind
Too bad youre fucked up
I used to be wasted always tried to take it
Take it down into my vein
I call the doctor hes just another
He said Im sick in the brain
He said You aint special so who you foolin
Dont try to give me a line
But I cant stop thinking bout doin it one more time oh no
But I already left you and youre better off left behind oh yeah
Aw its a bad obsession its always messing
Its always messing my mind
Its a bad obsession its always messing
Its always messing my mind
So bad boy

Heads up
Its a bad obsession its always messing
Its always messing my mind
Now its a bad obsession its always messing
Its always messing my mind
I cant stop thinking bout doin it one more time oh no
But I already left you and youre better off left behind oh oh oh no
Its a bad obsession and its always messing my mind
But I already left you and youre better off left behind
Maybe youll do better next time punk
