Bad Obsession Lyrics
I can't stop thinking, thinking about sinking
Sinking down into my bed
I call my mother, she's just a cunt now
She said I'm sick in the head
She said, "You ain't special, so who you foolin'?
Don't try to give me a line"

I can't stop thinking 'bout seein' you one more time, oh no
But I already left you and you're better off left behind
It's a bad obsession, it's always messing
It's always messing my mind
It's a bad obsession, it's always messing
It's always messing my mind

Too bad, you're fucked up

I used to be wasted, always tried to take it
Take it down into my vein
I call the doctor, he's just another
He said I'm sick in the brain
He said, "You ain't special, so who you foolin'?
Don't try to give me a line"

But I can't stop thinking 'bout doin' it one more time, oh no
But I already left you and you're better off left behind, oh yeah

Aw, it's a bad obsession, it's always messing
It's always messing my mind
It's a bad obsession, it's always messing
It's always messing my mind

So bad, boy


It's a
It's a
Heads up

It's a bad obsession, it's always messing
It's always messing my mind
Now it's a bad obsession, it's always messing
It's always messing my mind

I can't stop thinking 'bout doin' it one more time, oh no
But I already left you and you're better off left behind, oh oh oh no

It's a bad obsession and it's always messing my mind
But I already left you and you're better off left behind
Maybe you'll do better next time, punk2Embed
