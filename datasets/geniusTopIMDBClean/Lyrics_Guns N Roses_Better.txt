No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
The hardest part this troubled heart has never yet been through now
Was to heal the scars that got their start inside someone like you now
Boy had I known or Id been shown back when how long itd take me
To break the charms that brought me harm and all but would erase me
I never would hope that I could no matter what youd pay me
Replay the part you stole my heart I shouldve known youre crazy
If all I knew was that with you Id want someone to save me
Itd be enough but just my luck I fell in love and maybe
All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better
So bittersweet this tragedy wont ask for absolution
This melody inside of me still searches for solution
A twist of fate the change of heart cures my infatuation
A broken heart to provide the spark for my determination
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better
I never wanted you to be so full of anger
I never wanted you to be somebody else
I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves
I only wanted you to see things for yourself
All that I wanted was
Now I know you better
Now we all know better
All that I wanted was
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
If I were you Id manage to avoid the invitation
Of promised love that cant keep up with your adoration
Just use your head and in the end youll find your inspiration
To choose your steps and wont regret this kind of aggravation
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
No one ever told me when I was alone
They just thought Id know better better
