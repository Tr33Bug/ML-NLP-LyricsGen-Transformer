We all come in from the cold we come down from the wire
An everybody warms themselves to a different fire
An sometimes we get burned youd think sometime wed learn
The one you love is the one that should take you higher
You aint got no one you better go back out and find em
Just like children hidin in a closet cant tell whats goin on outside
Sometimes were so far off the beaten track we get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or some words of wit a hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love could hurt you now is a little hard to believe
But everybody darlin sometimes bites the hand that feeds
When I look around an everybody always brings me down
Well is it them or me Well I just cant see but there aint no peace to found
But if someone really cared well theyd take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand another ones despair
Remember in this game we call life that no one said its fair
Breakdown  Let me hear it now 
Breakdown  Let me hear it now yeah 
Breakdown  Let me hear it now 
Ive come to know the cold I think of it as home
When there aint enough of me to go around Id rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit Im out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me if I fit your needs Like when we both knew we had it
Now the damages done and were back out on the run
Funny how everything was roses when we held on to the guns
Just because youre winnin dont mean youre the lucky one
Breakdown  Let me hear it now 
Breakdown  Yeah 
Breakdown  Let me hear it now 
There goes the Challenger bein chased by the blue blue meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver
The last American hero thethe electric sintar
The demigod the super driver of the golden west
Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting closer closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile
Yeah baby they about to strike
They gonna get him smash rape
The last beautiful free soul on this planet
But it is written
If the evil spirit arms the tiger with claws
Brahman provided wings for the dove
Thus spake the super guru
Dyou hear that
