Catcher in the Rye Lyrics
When all is said and done, we're not the only ones
Who look at life this way, that's what the old folks say
But every time I'd see them makes me wish I had a gun
If I thought that I was crazy, well, I guess I'd have more fun
Guess I'd have more fun

Ooh, the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh, won't let you get away from him
It's just another day like today
You decide 'cause I don't have to
And then they'll find and I won't ask you
At any time or long hereafter
If the cold outside's as I'm imagining
It to be


Ooh, the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh, won't let you get away from him
It's just another day like today

When all is said and done, we're not the only ones
Who look at life this way, that's what the young folks say
As if they'd ever change as that were mine to say
But every time I'd see them makes me wish I had a gun
If I thought that I was crazy, well, I guess I'd have more fun
'Cause what used to be's not there for me
And ought to for someone that belonged
Insane, like I do

On an ordinary day, not in an ordinary way
All at once, the song I heard, no longer would it play
For anybody or anyone
That needed comfort from somebody
Needed comfort from someone
Who cared to be not like you and unlike me
And then the voices went away from me
Somehow, you set the wheels in motion, now haunts our memories
You were the instrument, you were the one
How a body, took a body, you gave that boy a gun
Took our innocence beyond our stares
Sometimes, the only thing we counted on when no one else was thereYou might also like2Embed
