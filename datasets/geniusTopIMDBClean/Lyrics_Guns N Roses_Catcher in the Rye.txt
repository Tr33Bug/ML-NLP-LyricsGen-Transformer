When all is said and done were not the only ones
Who look at life this way thats what the old folks say
But every time Id see them makes me wish I had a gun
If I thought that I was crazy well I guess Id have more fun
Guess Id have more fun
Ooh the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh wont let you get away from him
Its just another day like today
You decide cause I dont have to
And then theyll find and I wont ask you
At any time or long hereafter
If the cold outsides as Im imagining
It to be
Ooh the Catcher in the Rye again
Ooh wont let you get away from him
Its just another day like today
When all is said and done were not the only ones
Who look at life this way thats what the young folks say
As if theyd ever change as that were mine to say
But every time Id see them makes me wish I had a gun
If I thought that I was crazy well I guess Id have more fun
Cause what used to bes not there for me
And ought to for someone that belonged
Insane like I do
On an ordinary day not in an ordinary way
All at once the song I heard no longer would it play
For anybody or anyone
That needed comfort from somebody
Needed comfort from someone
Who cared to be not like you and unlike me
And then the voices went away from me
Somehow you set the wheels in motion now haunts our memories
You were the instrument you were the one
How a body took a body you gave that boy a gun
Took our innocence beyond our stares
Sometimes the only thing we counted on when no one else was there
