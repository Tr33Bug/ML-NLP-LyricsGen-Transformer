It dont really matter
Gonna find out for yourself
No it dont really matter ooh
Gonna leave this thing to somebody else
If they were missionaries
Realtime visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my disinfatuation
I know that Im a classic case
Watch my disenchanted face
Blame it on the Falun Gong
Theyve seen the end and you cant hold on now
Cause it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all Ive got is precious time
It dont really matter
Guess Ill keep it to myself
Said it dont really matter  matter matter 
Its time I look around for somebody else
Cause it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
When all weve got is precious time
More than you got to fool the nation
But all Ive got is precious time
It dont really matter
I guess youll find out for yourself
No it dont really matter  matter matter 
So you can hear it now from somebody else
You think you got it all locked up inside
And if you beat em enough theyll die
Its like a walk in the park from a cell
It dont really matter 
Now youre keeping your own kind in hell
It dont really matter 
When your Great Wall rocks blame yourself
It dont really matter 
While their arms reach out for your help
And youre out of time
