What weve got here is failure to communicate
Some men you just cant reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well he gets it
Whistling
And I dont like it any more than you men
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way theyve always done before
Look at the hate were breeding
Look at the fear were feeding
Look at the lives were leading
The way weve always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time cant deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
Dyou wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said Peace could last forever
And in my first memories they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in DC to remind us all
That you cant trust freedom when its not in your hands
When everybodys fightin for their promised land
And I dont need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Youre powerhungry sellin soldiers in a human grocery store
Aint that fresh I dont need your civil war
Ooh no no no no no no
Look at the shoes youre filling
Look at the blood were spilling
Look at the world were killing
The way weve always done before
Look in the doubt weve wallowed
Look at the leaders weve followed
Look at the lies weve swallowed
And I dont want to hear no more
My hands are tied
For all Ive seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer
I dont need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Youre powerhungry sellin soldiers in a human grocery store
Aint that fresh I dont need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I dont need your civil war
I dont need your civil war
Youre powerhungry sellin soldiers in a human grocery store
Aint that fresh I dont need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I dont need one more war
Ooh I dont need one more war
No no no no woah no woah
Whats so civil bout war anyway
