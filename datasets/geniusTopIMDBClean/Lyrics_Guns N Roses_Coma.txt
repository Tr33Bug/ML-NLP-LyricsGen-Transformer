Hey you caught me in a coma and I dont think I wanna
Ever come back to this world again
Kinda like it in a coma cause no ones ever gonna
Oh make me come back to this world again
Now I feel as if Im floating away
I cant feel all the pressure and I like it this way
But my bodys calling my bodys calling
Wont you come back to this world again
Suspended deep in a sea of black
Ive got the light at the end Ive got the bones on the mast
Well Ive gone sailing Ive gone sailing
I could leave so easily my friends are calling back to me
I said theyre theyre leavin it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is goin on
Goddamn it
Slipping farther and farther away
Its a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world thats full of shit
Help me
Okay lets get this guy in the program please were losing him Start an IV Please

Come on His airways someones got to protect his airways I want two
Wheres the defibrillator

Help Me
Slowmotion here This guys going
Bastard
Lets get him in ER
Going out on us
Whos got the defibrillator
Please understand me
Im climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just cant stifle all my screams
And Im waiting at the crossroads waiting for you
Waiting for you where are you
No ones going to bother me anymore
No ones going to mess with my head no more
I cant understand what all the fightings for
But its so nice here down off the shore
I wish you could see this cause theres nothing to see
Its peaceful here and its fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live ah
I know
Okay were starting to lose this guy I want that IV and his airway protected
Lets get some people in here
Get the crash cart please were losing this guy Hes going Give me an airway please

Zap the son of a bitch again
Listen to me
Axl are you listening to me
Dont walk away from me
You are such a fucking prick I am so pissed with you
Get back over here
All I hear is bullshit all the time
All you ever wanna do is have sex sex sex
I just dont give a shit anymore
I love you
You live your life like its a coma wont you tell me why wed wanna
With all the reasons you give its its kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that Ive seen any reason why you should stay
Maybe wed be better off without you anyway
You got a oneway ticket on your last chance ride
Got a oneway ticket to your suicide
Got a oneway ticket and theres no way out alive
An all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isnt much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is then theres stories to be told
No you dont need a doctor no one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger they just stepped aside
They be down by the water while you watch em waving goodbye
They be calling in the morning they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer but you know nobodys home
When the bells stopped ringing it was nobodys fault but your own
There were always ample warnings there were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin but we gave you too much time
And when you said that no ones listening whyd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
An its so easy to be social its so easy to be cool
Yeah its easy to be hungry when you aint got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
But Im still out here waiting watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking know its gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories that another man would need just to survive
