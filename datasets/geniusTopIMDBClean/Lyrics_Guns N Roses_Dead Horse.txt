Sick of this life not that youd care
Im not the only one with whom these feelings I share
Nobody understands quite why were here
Were searching for answers that never appear
Maybe if I looked real hard Id Id see you trying too
To understand this life that were all going through
Then when she said she was going to like wreck my car
I didnt know what to do
Oh sometimes I feel like Im beating a dead horse
And I dont know why youd be bringing me down
Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more
It may sound funny but youd think by now Id be smiling
I guess some things never change
Oh never change
I met an old cowboy I saw the look in his eyes
Something tells me hes been here before cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child when the thought first came to me
That Im a son of a gun and the gun of a son that brought back the devil in me
Oh but sometimes I feel like Im beating a dead horse
I dont know why youd be bringing me down
Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more
It may sound funny but youd think by now Id be smiling
Yeah I guess some things never change
Ooh never change
I aint quite what youd call an old soul
Still wet behind the years
Ive been around this track a couple of times
But now the dust is starting to clear oh yeah
Sometimes I feel like Im beating a dead horse
I dont know why youd be bringing me down
Id like to think that our loves worth a tad more
It may sound funny but youd think by now Id be smiling
Ooh yeah Id be smiling
No way Id be smiling
Ooh smiling
Sick of this life not that youd care
Im not the only one with whom these feelings I share
