Dead Horse Lyrics
Sick of this life, not that you'd care
I'm not the only one with whom, these feelings, I share
Nobody understands quite why we're here
We're searching for answers that never appear
Maybe if I looked real hard, I'd, I'd see you trying, too
To understand this life that we're all going through
"Then when she said she was going to, like, wreck my car
I didn't know what to do"

Oh, sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
And I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
I guess some things never change
Oh, never change
I met an old cowboy, I saw the look in his eyes
Something tells me he's been here before 'cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child when the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son that brought back the devil in me

Oh, but sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
Yeah, I guess some things never change
Ooh, never change

I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Still, wet behind the years
I've been around this track a couple of times
But now the dust is starting to clear, oh, yeah


Sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
Ooh, yeah, I'd be smiling
No way I'd be smiling
Ooh, smiling
You might also like
Sick of this life, not that you'd care
I'm not the only one with whom, these feelings, I share1Embed
