Dont Cry  Alternate Lyrics  Lyrics
If we could see tomorrow what of your plans
No one can live in sorrow ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride theyre back in demand
I was the one who was washing blood off your hands
Dont you cry tonight I still love you baby
Dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight theres a heaven above you baby
And dont you cry tonight
I know the things you wanted theyre not what you have
With all the people talking its driving you mad
If I was standing by you how would you feel
Knowing your loves decided and all love is real Yeah baby
Dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight theres a heaven above you baby
And dont you cry tonight
I thought I could live in your world as years all went by
With all the voices Ive heard something has died
And when youre in need of someone my heart wont deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to baby
And dont you cry tonight
And dont you cry tonight
And dont you cry tonight theres a heaven above you baby
And dont you cry
Dont you ever cry
Dont you cry tonight baby maybe someday
Dont you cry dont you ever cry
Dont you cry tonight
