Talk to me softly theres something in your eyes
Dont hang your head in sorrow and please dont cry
I know how you feel inside Ive Ive been there before
Something is changing inside you and dont you know
Dont you cry tonight I still love you baby
And dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight theres a heaven above you baby
And dont you cry tonight
Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Dont you take it so hard now and please dont take it so bad
Ill still be thinking of you and the times we had baby
And dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight theres a heaven above you baby
And dont you cry tonight
And please remember that I never lied oh
And please remember how I felt inside now honey
You gotta make it your own way but youll be alright now sugar
Youll feel better tomorrow come the morning light now baby
And dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight
Dont you cry tonight theres a heaven above you baby
And dont you cry
Dont you ever cry
Dont you cry tonight baby maybe someday
Dont you cry dont you ever cry
Dont you cry tonight
