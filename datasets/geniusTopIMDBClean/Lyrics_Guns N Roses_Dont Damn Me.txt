Yeah yeah yeah yay
Dont damn me when I speak a piece of mind
Cause silence isnt golden when Im holding it inside
Cause Ive been where I have been and Ive seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper cause its all a part of me
Be it a song or a casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Your words once heard they can place you in a faction
My words may disturb but at least theres a reaction
Oh yeah oh oh yeah
Sometimes I wanna kill sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give sometimes I never give a fuck
Its only for a while I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen didnt want to be a man
So I hid inside my world I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely I fell down when I was blind
So dont damn me when I speak a piece of mind
Cause silence isnt golden when Im holding it inside
Cause Ive been where I have been and Ive seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper cause its all a part of me
How can I ever satisfy you
And how can I ever make you see that
Deep inside were all somebody
And it dont matter who you you wanna be
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened cause this child has been condemned
So I stepped into your world I kicked you in the mind
And Im the only witness to the nature of my crime
But look at what weve done to the innocent and young
Whoa listen to whos talking cause were not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts you tell me whos to blame


I know you dont wanna hear me cryin
And I know you dont wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction lies in your illusion
But your delusions are yours and not mine
We take for granted we know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover and read what we want
Between selected lines
Dont hail me and dont idolize the ink
Or Ive failed in my intentions can you find the missing link
Your only validation is living your own life
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
So I send this song to the offended
I said what I meant and Ive never pretended
As so many others do intending just to please
If I damned your point of view could you turn the other cheek
Oh
Dont damn me when I speak a piece of mind
Cause silence isnt golden when Im holding it inside
Cause Ive been where Ive been and Ive seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper cause its all a part of me
Dont damn me
I said dont damn me
I said dont hail me
Ah dont damn me
Ouh
Smoke em if you got em
Alright that sucked
