Found a head and an arm in the garbage can
Dont know why Im here
Livin on the run for oh so long
I gotta go collect
Double talkin jive get the money motherfucker
Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin lies
No more patience man
Back in town an a all new friends
They sayin How you been
Fucked up and out of place
Thats how I felt back then
Double talkin jive get the money motherfucker
Cause I got no more patience
Double talkin liar  Lies 
No more patience man
You dig what Im sayin
