He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
I65
She loved him yesterday
Yesterdays over I said Okay thats alright
Time moves on thats the way
We live in hope to see the next day but thats alright
Sometimes these things they are so easy
Sometimes these things they are so cold
Sometimes these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no man dont let em get to you
Oh yeah ow yeah
She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister she said Okay thats alright
Buried her things today
Way back out deep behind the driveway and thats alright
Sometimes these women are so easy
Sometimes these women are so cold
Sometimes these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let em get to you
Oh oh yeah
Get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you forget about your home
And then youre just fucking gone
Theres no logic here today
Do as you got to go your own way I said thats right
Times short your lifes your own
And in the end we are just
Dust an bones
Dust an bones
Dust an bones
An thats all right dust an bone
An thats all right dust an bone
An thats all right dust an bone
An thats all right dust an bone
An thats all right dust an bone
An thats all right dust an bone
An thats all right dust an bone
An thats all right dust an bone
Thats all right dust an bone
Thats all right dust an bone
Just dust an bones yeah
