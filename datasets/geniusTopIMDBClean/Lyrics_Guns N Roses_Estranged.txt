When youre talkin to yourself and nobodys home
You can fool yourself you came in this world alone  Alone 
So nobody ever told you baby how it was gonna be
So whatll happen to you baby Guess well have to wait and see
One two
Old at heart but Im only 28
And Im much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart but its gettin much too late
To find ourselves so far apart
I dont know how youre sposed to find me lately
An what more could you ask from me
How could you say that I never needed you
When you took everythin said you took everythin from me
Hey yeah
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but I mustnt hesitate
If Im to find my own way out
Still talkin to myself and nobodys home  Alone 
So nobody ever told us baby how it was gonna be
So whatll happen to us baby Guess well have to wait and see
When I find out all the reasons
Maybe Ill find another way find another day
With all the changin seasons
Of my life maybe Ill get it right next time
An now that youve been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds back down on the ground
An you dont talk so loud an you dont walk so proud
Anymore and what for
Well I jumped into the river too many times to make it home
Im out here on my own an driftin all alone
If it doesnt show give it time to read between the lines
Cause I see the storm is gettin closer
An the waves they get so high
Seems everythin weve ever knowns here
Why must it drift away and die
Ill never find anyone to replace you
Guess Ill have to make it through this time woah this time
Without you
I knew the storm was gettin closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everythin weve ever knowns here
I never wanted it to die
