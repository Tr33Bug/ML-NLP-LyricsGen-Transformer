Estranged Lyrics
When you're talkin' to yourself and nobody's home
You can fool yourself, you came in this world alone (Alone)

So nobody ever told you, baby, how it was gonna be?
So what'll happen to you, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

Old at heart, but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's gettin' much too late
To find ourselves so far apart
I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
An' what more could you ask from me?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everythin', said, you took everythin' from me
Hey, yeah

Young at heart, an' it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

Still, talkin' to myself and nobody's home (Alone)

So nobody ever told us, baby, how it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us, baby? Guess we'll have to wait and see


When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way, find another day
With all the changin' seasons
Of my life, maybe I'll get it right next time
An' now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds, back down on the ground
An' you don't talk so loud an' you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?
You might also like

Well, I jumped into the river too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own an' driftin' all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time to read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is gettin' closer
An' the waves, they get so high
Seems everythin' we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?


I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through this time, woah, this time
Without you
I knew the storm was gettin' closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everythin' we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die13Embed
