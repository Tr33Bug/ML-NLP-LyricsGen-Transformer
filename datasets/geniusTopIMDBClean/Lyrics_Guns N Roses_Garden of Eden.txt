Garden of Eden Lyrics
It's a critical solution, and the east coast got the blues
It's a mass of confusion, like the lies they sell to you

You got a glass-jawed toothache of a mental disease
And they be running 'round back, see them line up on their knees
'Cause the kiss-ass sycophants, throwing penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go, watch them come in off the streets
While they're banging out front inside they're slamming to the crunch
Go on an throw me to the lions and the whole damn screaming bunch
'Cause the pissed-off rip-offs, they're everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's ever supposed to learn
This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem, you can't stop, it's rock n' roll

I read it on a wall, it went straight to my head
It said, "Dance to the tension of a world on edge"
We got racial violence, and who'll cast the first stone?
And sex is used anyway it can be
Sometimes, when I look out, it's hard to see the day
It's a feeling, you can have it, it's not mine to take away

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
And there's no one who's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the Garden of Eden

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem, you can't stop, it's rock n' roll
Suck on that

Looking through this point of view, there's no way I'm gonna fit in
No, you tell me what my eyes see, don't you tell me who to believe in
I ain't superstitious, but I know when something's wrong
I've been dragging my heels with a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along
You might also like
Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
And there's no one who's gonna believe this
But we're lost in the Garden of Eden, come on

Oh yeah

Most organized religions make a mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous and out of control
The Garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said, if they had someone to buy it, said I'm sure they'd sell my soul

This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem, you can't stop, it's rock n' roll

Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
(And we ain't talkin' about no poison apple
Or some missin' rib, ya hear?)
Said, there's no one who's gonna believe this
Said, we're lost in the Garden of Eden
This fire is burning, and it's out of control
It's not a problem, you can't stop, it's rock n' roll2Embed
