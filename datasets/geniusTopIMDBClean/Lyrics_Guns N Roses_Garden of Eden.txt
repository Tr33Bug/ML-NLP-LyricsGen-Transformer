Its a critical solution and the east coast got the blues
Its a mass of confusion like the lies they sell to you
You got a glassjawed toothache of a mental disease
And they be running round back see them line up on their knees
Cause the kissass sycophants throwing penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go watch them come in off the streets
While theyre banging out front inside theyre slamming to the crunch
Go on an throw me to the lions and the whole damn screaming bunch
Cause the pissedoff ripoffs theyre everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generations ever supposed to learn
This fire is burning and its out of control
Its not a problem you cant stop its rock n roll
I read it on a wall it went straight to my head
It said Dance to the tension of a world on edge
We got racial violence and wholl cast the first stone
And sex is used anyway it can be
Sometimes when I look out its hard to see the day
Its a feeling you can have it its not mine to take away
Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said were lost in the Garden of Eden
And theres no one whos gonna believe this
But were lost in the Garden of Eden
This fire is burning and its out of control
Its not a problem you cant stop its rock n roll
Suck on that
Looking through this point of view theres no way Im gonna fit in
No you tell me what my eyes see dont you tell me who to believe in
I aint superstitious but I know when somethings wrong
Ive been dragging my heels with a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent drag me along


Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said were lost in the Garden of Eden
And theres no one whos gonna believe this
But were lost in the Garden of Eden come on
Oh yeah
Most organized religions make a mockery of humanity
Our governments are dangerous and out of control
The Garden of Eden is just another graveyard
Said if they had someone to buy it said Im sure theyd sell my soul
This fire is burning and its out of control
Its not a problem you cant stop its rock n roll
Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said were lost in the Garden of Eden
And we aint talkin about no poison apple
Or some missin rib ya hear 
Said theres no one whos gonna believe this
Said were lost in the Garden of Eden
This fire is burning and its out of control
Its not a problem you cant stop its rock n roll
