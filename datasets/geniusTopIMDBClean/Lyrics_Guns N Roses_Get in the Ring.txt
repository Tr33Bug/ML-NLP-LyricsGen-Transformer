Yeah cmon
Why do you look at me when you hate me
Why should I look at you when you make me hate you too
I sense a smell of retribution in the air
I dont even understand why the fuck you even care
And I dont need your jealousy yeah
Why drag me down in your misery  Yeah 
And when you stare you dont think I feel it
But Im gonna deal it back to you in spades
When Im having fun you know I cant conceal it
Cause I know youd never cut it in my game oh no
And when youre talking about a vasectomy yeah
Ill be writing down your obituary history ouh
You got your bitches with the silicone injections
Crystal meth and yeast infections
Bleached blond hair collagen lip injections
Who are you to criticize my intentions
Got your subtle manipulative devices
Just like you I got my vices
I got a thought that would be nice
Id like to crush your head tight in my vice
Pain
And that goes for all you punks in the press that want to start shit by printing lies instead of the things we said
That means you Andy Secher at Hit Parader Circus magazine Mick Wall at Kerrang
Bob Guccione Jr at Spin what you pissed off cause your dad gets more pussy than you
Fuck you suck my fucking dick
You be ripping off the fucking kids while they be paying their hardearned money to read about the bands they want to know about
Printing lies starting controversy you want to antagonize me
Antagonize me motherfucker get in the ring motherfucker and Ill kick your bitchy little ass punk


I dont like you I just hate you
Im gonna kick your ass
Oh yeah
Oh yeah ouh
Ahahahaha
Ahahahaha
Ahahahaha
You may not like our integrity yeah
We built a world out of anarchy oh yeah
And in this corner weighing
In at 850 pounds Guns N Roses
Get in the ring get in the ring get in the ring get in the ring
Get in the ring get in the ring get in the ring get in the ring  get the fuck in 
Get in the ring get in the ring get in the ring get in the ring

This song is dedicated to all the Guns N Fuckin Roses fans
