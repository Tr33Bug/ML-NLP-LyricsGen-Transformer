All cautions made every chance was given
No effort spared to save what we had
All in good faith I would not hesitate
To extend myself and lend you my hand
But you had to play it cool had to do it your way
Had to be a fool had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true it wouldnt matter anyway
As tempers fade and lies forgiven
No cause embraced could break what we had
In its place a storm is liftin
I wouldve thought you could be more of a man
But you had to play it cool had to do it your way
Had to be a fool had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true it wouldnt matter anyway
Ayyayy ayyayy
Ayyayy ayyayy
But you had to play it cool had to do it your way
Had to be a fool had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true it wouldnt matter anyway
Had to play it cool had to do it your way
Had to be a fool had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true it wouldnt matter anyway
Had to play it cool had to do it your way
Had to be a fool had to throw it all away
Too hard school and you thought you were here to stay
If that were true it wouldnt matter anyway
