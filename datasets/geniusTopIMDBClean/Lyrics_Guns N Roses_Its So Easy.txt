I see your sister in her Sunday dress
Shes out to please she pouts her best
Shes out to take no need to try
Shes ready to make
Its so easy easy
When everybodys trying to please me baby
Its so easy easy
When everybodys trying to please me
Cars are crashing every night
I drink and drive everythings in sight
I make the fire but I miss the firefight
I hit the bullseye every night
Its so easy easy
When everybodys trying to please me baby
Yeah its so easy easy
When everybodys trying to please me
Its so easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you you fall down huh
I see you standing there
You think youre so cool
Why dont you just
Fuck off
You get nothing for nothing if thats what you do
Turn around bitch I got a use for you
Besides you aint got nothing better to do
And Im bored
Its so easy easy
When everybodys trying to please me baby
Yeah its so easy easy
When everybodys trying to please me
Its so easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
So come with me
Dont ask me where cause I dont know
Ill try to please you
I aint got no money but it goes to show
Its so easy so fucking easy
Its so easy so damn easy
Its so easy oh so fucking easy
Its so easy yeah so easy
Its so easy so fucking easy
Its so easy yeah
