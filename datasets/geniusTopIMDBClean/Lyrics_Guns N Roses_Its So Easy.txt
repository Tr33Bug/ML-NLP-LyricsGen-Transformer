Itâ€™s So Easy Lyrics
I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please, she pouts her best
She's out to take, no need to try
She's ready to make

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, baby
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me
Cars are crashing every night
I drink and drive everything's in sight
I make the fire, but I miss the firefight
I hit the bullseye every night

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, baby
Yeah, it's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

It's so easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
See me hit you, you fall down, huh

I see you standing there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off

You might also like
You get nothing for nothing if that's what you do
Turn around, bitch, I got a use for you
Besides, you ain't got nothing better to do
And I'm bored

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, baby
Yeah, it's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

It's so easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night
So come with me
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I'll try to please you
I ain't got no money, but it goes to show

It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, so damn easy
It's so easy, oh, so fucking easy
It's so easy, yeah, so easy
It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, yeah!13Embed
