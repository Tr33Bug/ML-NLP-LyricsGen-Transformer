Locomotive  Complicity  Lyrics
Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah Ill find a way to cure the pain
If I said that youre my friend and our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hoping that youd find your own way in
But how can I protect you or try not to neglect you
When you wont take the love I have to give
Yeah I bought me an illusion and I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams and I had to have them all
But oh the taste is never so sweet as what youd believe it is
Well I guess it never is its these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood to the heart of the biz
You know I never thought that it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah I let you shape me but I feel as though you raped me
Cause you climbed inside my world and in my song
So now Ive closed the door to keep the cold outside
Seems somehow Ive found the will to live
But how can I forget you or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive Yeah yeah
Sweetness is a virtue and you lost your virtue long ago
You know Id like to hurt you but my conscience always tells me No
You could sell your body on the street to anyone whom you might meet
Whod love to try and get inside and bust your innocence open wide
Cause my babys got a locomotive my babys gone off the track
My babys got a locomotive got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like Im insane
Take a closer look Im not to blame no


Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
Id rather take a detour cause this road aint  getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
Better tame that boy cause hes a wild one
Better tame that boy fore hes a man
Sweetheart dont make me laugh yous getting too big for your pants
And I think maybe you should cut out while you can
You can use your illusion let it take you where it may
We live and learn and then sometimes its best to walk away
Me Im just here hanging on its my only place to stay
At least for now anyway
Ive worked too hard for my illusions just to throw them all away
Im taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love thats passed away
I know its never easy so why should you believe me
When Ive always got so many things to say
Callin off the dogs a simple choice is made
Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page
Kindness is a treasure and its one towards me youve seldom shown
So Ill say it for good measure to all the ones like you Ive known
Ya know Id like to shave your head and all my friends could paint it red
Cause love to me is a twoway street an all I really want is peace
But my babys got a locomotive my babys gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like Im insane
Take a closer look Im not to blame no
Affection is a blessing can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing together but the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah I know its hard to face when all weve worked fors gone to waste
But youre such a stupid woman and Im such a stupid man
But love like time s got its own plans
But my babys got a locomotive my babys gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like Im insane
Take a closer look Im not to blame no
Yeah if love is blind I guess Ill buy myself a cane
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
Loves so strange
