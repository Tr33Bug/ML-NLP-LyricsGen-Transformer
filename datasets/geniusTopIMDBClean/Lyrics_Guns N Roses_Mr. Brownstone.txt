Mr. Brownstone Lyrics

I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothin', no
Because worrying's a waste of my time
Show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine
We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before

We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone


Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line
You might also like
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said, a little better than before

We've been dancing with Mr. Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone, never
Oh, leave me alone

Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I shoulda known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I, I leave it all behind
