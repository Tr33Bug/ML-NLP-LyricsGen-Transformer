Mr Brownstone Lyrics
I get up around seven
Get outta bed around nine
And I dont worry about nothin no
Because worryings a waste of my time
Show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin a drink and feelin fine
Weve been dancing with Mr Brownstone
Hes been knocking he wont leave me alone
No no no he wont leave me alone
I used to do a little but a little wouldnt do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldnt do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said a little better than before
Weve been dancing with Mr Brownstone
Hes been knocking he wont leave me alone
No no no he wont leave me alone
Now I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man hes a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line


I used to do a little but a little wouldnt do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said a little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldnt do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep tryna get a little better
Said a little better than before
Weve been dancing with Mr Brownstone
Hes been knocking he wont leave me alone
No no no he wont leave me alone never
Oh leave me alone
Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it it drove outta my mind
I shoulda known better said I wish I never met her
Said I I leave it all behind
Yowza
