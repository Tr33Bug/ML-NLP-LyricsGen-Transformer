Your daddy works in porno now that mommys not around
She used to love her heroin but now shes underground
So you stay out late at night and you do your coke for free
Drivin your friends crazy with your lifes insanity
Well well well you just cant tell
Well well well my Michelle
Look out
Sowin all your wild oats in anothers luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early and this hotel wasnt free
So party til your connection calls honey Ill return the key
Well well well you just cant tell
Well well well my Michelle
Well well well you never can tell
Well well well my Michelle
Everyone needs love
You know that its true
Someday youll find someone thatll fall in love with you
But oh the time it takes
When youre all alone
Someday youll find someone that you can call your own
But til then ya better
Now youre clean and so discreet I wont say a word
But most of all this song is true case you havent heard
So cmon and stop your cryin we both know money burns
Honey dont stop tryin and youll get what you deserve


Well well well you just cant tell
Well well well my Michelle
Well well well you never can tell
Well well well my Michelle yeah
My my my Michelle
My my my Michelle
Ooh my my my Michelle
My my my my my my my my Michelle
Michelle
