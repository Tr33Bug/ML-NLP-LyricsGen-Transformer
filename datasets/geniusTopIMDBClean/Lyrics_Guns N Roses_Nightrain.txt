Loaded like a freight train
Flyin like an aeroplane
Feelin like a space brain
One more time tonight look out
Well Im a west coast struttin
One bad mother
Got a rattlesnake suitcase under my arm
Said Im a mean machine been drinkin gasoline
And honey you can make my motor hum
Well I got one chance left in a nine lives cat
I got a a dogeatdog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match to go
I smoke my cigarette with style
And I can tell you honey you can make my money tonight
Wake up late honey put on your clothes
And take your credit card to the liquor store
Well thats one for you and two for me by tonight
Ill be loaded like a freight train
Flyin like an aeroplane
Feelin like a space brain
One more time tonight
Im on the nightrain bottoms up
Im on the nightrain fill my cup
Im on the nightrain ready to crash and burn
I never learn
Im on the nightrain I love that stuff
Im on the nightrain an I can never get enough
Im on the nightrain never to return no
Loaded like a freight train
Flyin like an aeroplane
Speedin like a space brain
One more time tonight
Im on the nightrain and Im looking for some
Im on the nightrain so I can leave this slum
Im on the nightrain and Im ready to crash and burn
Nightrain bottoms up
Im on the nightrain fill my cup
Im on the nightrain ah ah ah whoa yeah
Im on the nightrain love that stuff
Im on the nightrain and I can never get enough
Ridin the nightrain I guess I
I guess I guess I guess I never learn
Nightrain float me home
Oh Im on the nightrain
Ridin the nightrain never to return
Nightrain
