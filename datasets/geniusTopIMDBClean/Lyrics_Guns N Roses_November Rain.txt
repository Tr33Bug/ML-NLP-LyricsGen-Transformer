When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin when I hold you
Dont you know I feel the same Yeah
Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And its hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
Weve been through this such a long long time
Just tryna kill the pain ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no ones really sure whos lettin go today walkin away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head just knowin that you were mine all mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin dont refrain
Or Ill just end up walkin
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own
Do you need some time all alone
Ooh everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh dont you know you need some time all alone
I know its hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldnt time be out to charm you woahwoah


Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Ooh everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh dont you know you need some time all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When theres no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
Cause nothin lasts forever
Even cold November rain
Dont ya think that you need somebody
Dont ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
Youre not the only one youre not the only one
Dont ya think that you need somebody
Dont ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
Youre not the only one youre not the only one
Dont ya think that you need somebody
Dont ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
Youre not the only one youre not the only one
Dont ya think that you need somebody
Dont ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
