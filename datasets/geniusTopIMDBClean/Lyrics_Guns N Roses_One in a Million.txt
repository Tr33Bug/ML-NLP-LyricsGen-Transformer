Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind some peace of mind thatll stay
So I thumbed it down to 6th in LA
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way
Police and niggers thats right get out of my way
Dont need to buy none of your gold chains today
Now dont need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket til then wont you cut me some slack
Youre one in a million yeah thats what you are
Youre one in a million babe youre a shooting star
Maybe someday well see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high much too high much too high
Immigrants and faggots they make no sense to me
They come to our country and think theyll do as they please
Like start some mini Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many God damn ways its all Greek to me
Well some say Im lazy and others say thats just me
Some say Im crazy I guess Ill always be
But its been such a long time since I knew right from wrong
Its all the means to and end II keep it moving along
Hey hey hey yeah
Youre one in a million yeah youre a shooting star
Youre one in a million babe you know that you are
Maybe some day well see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high much too high much too high oh
Radicals and racists dont point your finger at me
Im a small town white boy just trying to make ends meet
Dont need your religion dont watch that much TV
Just making my living baby well thats enough for me
Youre one in a million yeah you know that you are
Youre one in a million babe youre a shooting star
Maybe someday well see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high much too high oh much too high
Much too high much too high much too high
Much too high much too high much too high
