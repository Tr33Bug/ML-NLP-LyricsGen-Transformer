Been hidin out and layin low
Its nothing new to me
Well you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity
They break down the doors and they rape my rights but
They wont judge me
They scream and yell and fight all night
You cant tell me
I lose my head I close my eyes
They wont judge me
Cause I got something Ive been building up inside
For so fuckin long
Theyre out to get me
They wont catch me
Im fucking innocent
They wont break me
Sometimes its easy to forget where youre goin
Sometimes its harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what youre doin
Thats when your troubles exceed
They push me into a corner just to get me to fight but
They wont judge me
They preach and yell and fight all night
You cant tell me
I lose my head I close my eyes
They wont judge me
Cause I got something Ive been buildin up inside
Im already gone
Theyre out to get me
They wont catch me
Cause Im innocent
They wont break me
No
No wowoh
Nono
Nonono Nonono
No
No wowoh
Nono
Nonono
Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didnt buy that a fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So Id be quick to disagree
Theyre out to get me
They wont catch me
Im fucking innocent
They wont break me
Theyre out to get me
They wont catch me
Cause Im innocent
So you can suck me
Take that one to heart
