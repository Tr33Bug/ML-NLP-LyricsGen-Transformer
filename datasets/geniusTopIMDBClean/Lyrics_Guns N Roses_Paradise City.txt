Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home  Oh wont you please take me home
Take me down to the Paradise City

Just an urchin living under the street Im a
Hard case thats tough to beat
Im your charity case so buy me something to eat
Ill pay you at another time take it to the end of the line
Rags to riches or so they say you gotta
Keep pushing for the fortune and fame
You know its its all a gamble when its just a game
You treat it like a capital crime everybodys doing the time

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh wont you please take me home Yeahyeah

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Strapped in the chair of the citys gas chamber
Why Im here I cant quite remember

But I cant see tell me who youre gonna believe
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home yeahyeah

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh wont you please take me home oh yeah
So faraway

Hes a court jester with a broken heart
He said Turn me around and take me back to the start
