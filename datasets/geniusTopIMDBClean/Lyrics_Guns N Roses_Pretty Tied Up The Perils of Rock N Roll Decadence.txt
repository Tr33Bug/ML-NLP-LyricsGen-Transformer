Pretty Tied Up  The Perils of Rock N Roll Decadence  Lyrics
The perils of rock n roll decadence
I know this chick she lives down on Melrose
She aint satisfied without some pain ooh
Friday night is going up inside her again
Well crack the whip cause that bitch is just insane
Im serious 
Shes pretty tied up hanging upside down
Shes pretty tied up and you can ride her
Shes pretty tied up hanging upside down
Ooh I cant tell you shes the right one
Oh no oh no oh no
Once there was this rock and roll band rolling on the streets
Time went by and it became a joke
We just needed more and more fulfilling uhhuh
Time went by and it all went up in smoke
But check it out 
Shes pretty tied up hanging upside down
Shes pretty tied up and you can ride her
Shes pretty tied up hanging upside down
I cant tell you shes the right one
Oh no oh no oh no
Once you made that money it costs more now
It might cost a lot more than youd think
I just found a million dollars that someone forgot
Its days like this that push me over the brink
Cool and stressing 
Shes pretty tied up hanging upside down
Shes pretty tied up and you can ride her
Shes pretty tied up hanging upside down
I cant tell you shes the right one


Oh shes the right one shes the right one
I cant tell you shes the right one
Oh shes the right one
Shes the right one shes the right one
Oh no woah woah woah
