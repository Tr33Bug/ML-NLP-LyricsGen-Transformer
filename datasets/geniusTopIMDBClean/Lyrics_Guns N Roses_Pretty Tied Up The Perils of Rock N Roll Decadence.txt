Pretty Tied Up (The Perils of Rock Nâ€™ Roll Decadence) Lyrics
The perils of rock n' roll decadence

I know this chick, she lives down on Melrose
She ain't satisfied without some pain, ooh
Friday night is going up inside her again
Well, crack the whip, 'cause that bitch is just insane
(I'm serious)

She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
Ooh, I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Once, there was this rock and roll band, rolling on the streets
Time went by and it became a joke
We just needed more and more fulfilling, uh-huh
Time went by and it all went up in smoke
(But check it out)

She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh no, oh no, oh no


Once you made that money, it costs more, now
It might cost a lot more than you'd think
I just found a million dollars that someone forgot
It's days like this that push me over the brink
(Cool and stressing)

She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down
I can't tell you she's the right one
You might also like
Oh, she's the right one, she's the right one
I can't tell you she's the right one
Oh, she's the right one
She's the right one, she's the right one
Oh no, woah, woah, woahEmbed
