If I say I dont need anyone I can say these things to you
Cause I can turn on anyone just like Ive turned on you
Ive got a tongue like a razor a sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors but then youll do whatever I like
Here I am and youre a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young but honey I aint naive
Here I am and youre a Rocket Queen oh yeah
I might be too much but honey youre a bit obscene
Ive seen everything imaginable pass before these eyes
Ive had everything thats tangible honey youd be surprised
Im a sexual innuendo in this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything you better turn me on tonight
Here I am and youre a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young but honey I aint naive
Here I am and youre a Rocket Queen oh yeah
I might be too much but honey youre a bit obscene
Here I am and youre a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young but honey I aint naive
Here I am and youre a Rocket Queen oh yeah
I might be too much but honey youre a bit obscene
I see you standin standin on your own
Its such a lonely place for you for you to be
If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend
Ill be here standing until the bitter end
No one needs the sorrow no one needs the pain
I hate to see you walking out there out in the rain
So dont chastise me or think I I mean you harm
Of those that take you leave you strung out much too far
Baby yeah ohohohohohohohoh
No no no no no no no no no baby yeah


Dont ever leave me say youll always be there
All I ever wanted was for you to know that I care
