I dont have plans and schemes
And I dont have hopes and dreams
I I I dont have anything
Since I dont have you
And I dont have fond desires
And I dont have happy hours
I I I dont have anything
Since I dont have you  I dont have 
Happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And hes been here since then
Yep were fucked
I dont have love to share
And I dont have one who cares
I I I dont have anything
Since I dont have you
Oh
You you you oh oh
You you you oh oh
You you you oh oh
You you you oh oh
You you oh yeah
