Ooh ah
Ah
How could she look so fine
How could it be she might be mine
How could she be so cool
Ive been taken for a fool so many times hey
Its a story of a man who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns as the story takes its turn
And leaves a broken man
How could she be so cool Ah
How could she be so fine
I owe a favor to a friend
My friends they always come through for me
Its a story of a man who works as hard as he can
Just to be a man who stands on his own
But the book always burns as the story takes its turn
And leaves a broken man
If you could only live my life you could see the difference
You make to me to me
And Id look right up at night
And all Id see was darkness
Now I see the stars alright
I want to reach right up and grab one for you
When the lights went down in your house
Yeah that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
Yeah I think you know where that comes from
Guitar come on


Yeah when I look right up at night
And all Id see was darkness
Now I see the stars alright
I want to reach right up and grab one for you
When the lights went down in your house
Yeah that made me happy
The sweat I make for you
I think you know where that comes from
How could she look so good So good
How could she be so fine
How could she be so cool
How could it be she might be mine
Yeah
