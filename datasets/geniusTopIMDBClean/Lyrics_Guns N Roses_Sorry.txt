Sorry Lyrics
You like to hurt me, you know that you do
You like to think in some way that it's me and not you
But we know that isn't true
You like to have me jump and be good, but I don't want to do it
You don't know why I won't act the way you think I should
You thought they'd make me behave and submit, submit
What were you thinking?
'Cause I don't forget
You don't know why I won't give in
Hell with the pressure, I'm not caving in
You know that I got under your skin
You sold your soul but I won't let you win
You talk too much, you say I do
Difference is nobody cares about you
You've got all the answers, you know everything
Why nobody asked you is a mystery to me

I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe
I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You don't know who you can trust now or you should believe
You should believe
You don't know who you can trust now or you should believe


You close your eyes, all well and good
I'll kick your ass like I said that I would
You tell them stories they'd rather believe
Use and confuse them, they're numb and naive
Truth is the truth hurts, don't you agree?
It's harder to live with the truth about you
Than to live with the lies about me

Nobody owes you not one god damn thing
You know where to put your, "Just shut up and sing"
You might also like
I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe
I'm sorry for you, not sorry for me
You chose to hurt those that love you and won't set them free
Won't set them free
You chose to hurt those that love you and won't set them free

You don't need anyone else to be sorry for you
You've got no heart
You can't see all that you've done for me
I know the reasons you tear me apartEmbed
