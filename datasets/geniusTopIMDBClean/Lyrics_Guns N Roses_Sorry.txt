You like to hurt me you know that you do
You like to think in some way that its me and not you
But we know that isnt true
You like to have me jump and be good but I dont want to do it
You dont know why I wont act the way you think I should
You thought theyd make me behave and submit submit
What were you thinking
Cause I dont forget
You dont know why I wont give in
Hell with the pressure Im not caving in
You know that I got under your skin
You sold your soul but I wont let you win
You talk too much you say I do
Difference is nobody cares about you
Youve got all the answers you know everything
Why nobody asked you is a mystery to me
Im sorry for you not sorry for me
You dont know who in the hell to or not to believe
Im sorry for you not sorry for me
You dont know who you can trust now or you should believe
You should believe
You dont know who you can trust now or you should believe
You close your eyes all well and good
Ill kick your ass like I said that I would
You tell them stories theyd rather believe
Use and confuse them theyre numb and naive
Truth is the truth hurts dont you agree
Its harder to live with the truth about you
Than to live with the lies about me
Nobody owes you not one god damn thing
You know where to put your Just shut up and sing
Im sorry for you not sorry for me
You dont know who in the hell to or not to believe
Im sorry for you not sorry for me
You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free
Wont set them free
You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free
You dont need anyone else to be sorry for you
Youve got no heart
You cant see all that youve done for me
I know the reasons you tear me apart
