All the love in the world couldnt save you
All the innocence inside
You know I tried so hard to make you
Oh to make you change your mind
And it hurts too much to see you
And how you left yourself behind
You know I wouldnt want to be you
Now theres a hell I cant describe
So now I wander through my days
And try to find my ways to the feelings that I felt
I saved for you and no one else
And though as long as this road seems
I know its called the street of dreams
But thats not stardust on my feet
It leaves a taste thats bittersweet
Thats called the blues ooh
I dont know just what I should do
Everywhere Id go I see you
Though its what you planned
This much is true
What I thought was beautiful
Dont live inside of you anymore
I dont know just what I should do
Everywhere Id go I see you
Though its what you planned
This much is true
What I thought was beautiful
Dont live inside of you anymore
What this means to me is more than I know you believe
What I thought of you now has cost more than it should for me
What I thought was true before were lies I couldnt see
What I thought was beautiful is only memories
Oh oh oh
Whatd I tell you
Oh oh oh
Thats what theyll tell ya
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Inside of you
