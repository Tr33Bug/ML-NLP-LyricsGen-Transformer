Shes got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky  Sky 
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long Id probably break down and cry
Woahwoahwoah
Sweet child of mine
Woah ohohoh
Sweet love of mine
Shes got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
Id hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child Id hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Woahohwoah
Sweet child of mine
Oohwoah ohohoh
Sweet love of mine
Woah ohohoh
Sweet child of mine ooh yeaheh
Oohoohoohooh
Sweet love of mine
