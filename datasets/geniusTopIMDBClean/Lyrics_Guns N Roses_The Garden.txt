The Garden Lyrics
No I won't

You know you're all alone, your friends, they aren't at home
Everybody's gone to the garden
As you look into the trees, you can look, but you don't see
Flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care
What's it with you man, and this garden? Yeah
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost, no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without


You can find it all inside, no need to wrestle with your pride
No, you ain't losing your mind, you're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside for the garden

I wasn't really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering 'round for daze
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On this garden song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
It's a crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show you
But it sure was glad to know you
You might also like
Bye-bye, so long, bye-bye
It's glad to know you
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Aw, so long3Embed
