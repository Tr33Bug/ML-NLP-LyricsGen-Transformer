No I wont
You know youre all alone your friends they arent at home
Everybodys gone to the garden
As you look into the trees you can look but you dont see
Flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybodys there but you dont seem to care
Whats it with you man and this garden Yeah
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy mans utopia
If youre lost no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the gardens song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
You can find it all inside no need to wrestle with your pride
No you aint losing your mind youre just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside for the garden
I wasnt really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering round for daze
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On this garden song and dance
Feel her flowers as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
Its a crazy mans utopia
If youre lost no one can show you
But it sure was glad to know you
Byebye so long byebye
Its glad to know you
Byebye
Byebye
Aw so long
