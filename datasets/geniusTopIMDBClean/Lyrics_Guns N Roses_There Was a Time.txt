Broken glass and cigarettes writin on the wall
It was a bargain for the summer and I thought I had it all
I was the one who gave you everythin the one who took the fall
You were the one who would do anythin one who cant recall
Where she was while she was sleepin in another womans bed
Or the doctors or the lawyers or a stranger that she met
If theres nothin I can gain from this or anythin at all
Itd be the knowledge that you gave me when I thought Id heard it all
It was a long time for you
It was a long time for me
Itd be a long time for anyone but
Looks like its meant to be
Social class and registers cocaine in the hall
All the way from California on the way to your next call
To those nonnegotiations to simulate a cause
For the betterment of evils and your ways around the laws
That keep you up and sittin pretty on a pedestal or bed
An now youre sleepin like an angel never mind who you gave head
If theres somethin I can make of this or anything at all
Itd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all
It was a wrong time for you
It was a wrong time for me
It was the wrong time for anyone but
Looks like I got to see for myself
If I could go back in time to the place in my soul
There all alone lonely teardrops ooh are calling you
But I dont want to know it now cause knowing you
It wont change a damn thing but there was a time
Yeah there was a time I didnt wanna know at all
Didnt wanna know at all and I dont wanna know it now
Yeah there was a time I didnt wanna know at all
Didnt wanna know at all and I dont wanna know it now
I would do anything for you there was a time
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you there was a time
There was a time I would do anything for you
Ooh I would do anything for you
Yeah there was a time I didnt wanna know at all
Didnt wanna know at all and I dont wanna know it now 
I would do anything for you
Didnt wanna know at all
Didnt wanna know at all and I dont wanna know it now 
There was a time there was a time
