And now I dont know why she wouldnt say goodbye
But then it seems that I had seen it in her eyes
Though it might not be wise Id still have to try
With all the love I have inside I cant deny
I just cant let it die cause her hearts just like mine
And she holds her pain inside
So if you ask me why she wouldnt say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
There is a special light still shining bright
And even on the darkest night she cant deny
So if shes somewhere near me I hope to God she hears me
Theres no one else could ever make me feel Im so alive
I hoped shed never leave me please God you must believe me
Ive trudged the universe and found myself within her eyes
No matter how I try you say its all a lie
So whats the use of my confessions to a crime
Of passions that wont die
In my heart
So if shes somewhere near me I hope to God she hears me
Theres no one else could ever make me feel Im so alive
I hoped shed never leave me please God you must believe me
Ill trudge the universe and find myself within her eyes
So if shes somewhere near me I hope to God she hears me
Theres no one else could ever make me feel Im so alive
I hoped shed never leave me please God you must believe me
Ive searched the universe and find myself within her eyes
So now I dont know why she wouldnt say goodbye
It just might be that I had seen it in her eyes
And now it seems that I gave up my ghost of pride
Ill never say goodbye
