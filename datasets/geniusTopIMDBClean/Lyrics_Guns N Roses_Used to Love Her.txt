I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her hm yeah but I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complain
I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her hm yeah but I had to kill her
I knew Id miss her so I had to keep her
Shes buried right in my backyard
I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her hm yeah but I had to kill her
She bitched so much she drove me nuts
And now I am happier this way
Woah woah yeah take it for what it is
I used to love her but I had to kill her
I used to love her hm yeah but I had to kill her
I had to put her six feet under
And I can still hear her complain
