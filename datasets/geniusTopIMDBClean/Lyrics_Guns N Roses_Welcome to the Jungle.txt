Welcome to the jungle we got fun and games
We got everything you want honey we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money honey we got your disease
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shunnnnnnnnnnnn knees knees
Mwah ah I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle we take it day by day
If you want it youre going to bleed but its the price you pay
And youre a very sexy girl its very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights but you wont get there for free

You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play

Ever want to come down
