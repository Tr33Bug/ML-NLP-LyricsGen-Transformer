Yesterday there was so many things I was never told
Now that Im starting to learn I feel Im growing old
Cause yesterdays got nothing for me
Old pictures that Ill always see
Time just fades the pages in my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket and no hand in destiny
Ill keep on movin along with no time to plant my feet
Cause yesterdays got nothing for me
Old pictures that Ill always see
Some things could be better if wed all just let them be
Ooh yesterdays got nothing for me
Yesterdays got nothing for me
Got nothing for me ooh yeah
Yesterday there were so many things I was never shown
Suddenly this time I found Im on the streets and Im all alone
Yesterdays got nothing for me
Old pictures that Ill always see
I aint got time to reminisce old novelties
Ooh yesterdays got nothing for me
Yesterdays ooh got nothing for me
Yesterdays got nothing for me
Yesterday
Yesterday
