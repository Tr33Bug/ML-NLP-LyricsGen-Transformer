Im a cold heartbreaker fit to burn and Ill rip your heart in two
And Ill leave you lyin on the bed
Ill be out the door before you wake em its nothin new to you
Cause I think weve seen that movie too
Cause you could be mine but youre way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin done I said you could be mine aw
Now holidays come and then they go its nothin new today
Collect another memory
When I come home late at night dont ask me where Ive been
Just count your stars Im home again
Cause you could be mine but youre way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin done I said you could be mine
You could be mine you could be mine
You could be mine you could be mine
You could be mine mine mine mine
Youve gone sketching too many times
Ooh why dont you give it a rest
Why must you find another reason to cry
Well youre breakin down my back and Ive been rackin out my brain
It dont matter how we make it cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it until mornin but this nightmare never ends
Dont forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An you can take the pity so far but its more than I can stand
Cause this couchtrips gettin older tell me how long has it been
Cause five years is forever and you havent grown up yet


Oh you could be mine but youre way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin done I said you could you should be
You could be mine
Oh you could be mine
You could be mine
Aw you could be mine
You could be mine
Aw You could be mine
Aw You could be mine
Aw You could be mine
You could be mine yeah
