Afternoon in the homeroom
Theyre about to let you go
And the locker slam on the plan
You had tonight
Youve been messin around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
Theres a wise guy that you know could
Put you right
In the lot the boy thats idling by
Doesnt rev your heart
Cause its only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
Theres life after high school
And thats why
The student body got a bad reputation
Oh yeah oh yeah 
What they need is adult education
Back to school its a bad situation
Oh yeah oh yeah 
What you want is an adult education
Oh yeah
The teacher dont know about how to deal
With the student body  huh huh 
And the underclassmen are flashing
Hot and cool  huh huh 
But your girlfriends care
About watch and wear
And talkin about it  huh huh 
Believe it or not
Theres life after high school  huh huh 
Thats right
The student body got a bad reputation
Oh yeah oh yeah 
What they need is adult education
You go back to school its a bad situation
Oh yeah oh yeah 
What you want is an adult education
Oh yeah
Theyre calling it preparation  huh huh 
Youre waiting for a separation
Youre nothing but another odd number  huh huh 
Memories that you wont remember
So you got a little education  huh huh 
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school  huh huh 
Maybe some of itll rub off on ya
The boys are busy in the mirrors  huh huh 
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender  huh huh 
More memories you wont remember
The senior with the Junior Miss  huh huh 
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult  huh huh 
That she could graduate to adult kisses
Adult education
Adult education
Adult education
Its a bad situation
Adult education
Adult adult
Adult adult education
Adult education
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Adult adult
Adult adult
Adult adult
Adult adult
Adult adult adult
Adult adult adult
Adult adult adult
Adult adult adult
