Just a little boy lost looking for a lamb in the all night city
Living in his lonely limousine
And though he never has to worry
Hes the only one and only one hes ever gonna need
Absolutely hes in definite need
Of a woman child and some better kind of love when the hot towns hurt him
And he knows how happy he could be
But he dont know if he can make it
Between the money and another lonely night
But now the time has come
Got to stay or run
Now the time has come
Oh maybe weve been Alone Too Long
And you dont want to be lonely
Another pretty face another body ache still awake threethirty
Dial another number  No one home
So then he wastes his time with TV
And he wonders if he lost the only one
And wonders if hes free
Too afraid to see
How alone he could be
Oh maybe weve been Alone Too Long
And you dont want to be lonely
