Back Together Again LyricsHe's back together again
Yeah ev'ryone is glad that he's together again
Just like the old days, old days, old days
Yeah he could sing, he could sing, he could sing
He's back together again
You know he's still got the moves
You know the grooves still there
Just like the old days old days, old days
Yeah he could sing, he could sing, Listen to him sing
Back together again, back together again singing the same old story
Back together again, back together again
The old songs never end
Gives you something to believe in
Remember sixty-five
Well the kids are all grown up
But their records are still alive
Just like the old days, old days, old days
Yeah he could sing, he could sing, he could sing
He's back riding high
The charts are full of love, he's on ev'rybody's dial
Just like the old days, old days, old days
Yeah he could sing, he could sing
Listen to him sing
Back together again, back together again Singing the same old story
Back together again, back together again
The old songs never end
That's you something to believe in
The old songs never end
Oh just listen to him sing
Back together again, back together again
Singing the same old story
Back together again, back together again
The old songs never end
And that's you something to believe inYou might also likeEmbed
