Pardon the crazy way I behave
And the things I say
Maybe Im too young to know the score
But theres something inside not right
Wish I could vocalize
If I screamed would you realize
Feeling like a child without his toys
But just want to tell you
Everythings all right
Im just looking at you through
Crazy eyes tonight
So if Im acting kind of strange
Im just looking through crazy eyes
Cloudy day say it looks like rain
Whats the use I know its all the same
Read a magazine electric light
Is keeping me from my dreams
How do I sound to you
Like a fool a little cuckoo too
I only wish I know what I should do
Believe me when tell you
Everythings all right
Im just looking at you through
Crazy eyes tonight
So if Im acting kind of strange
Im just looking through crazy eyes
Everything seems to have changed
I dont even know my name
I wish I could place the blame on someone
But theres no one
Everythings all right
Im just looking at you through
Crazy eyes tonight
So if Im acting kind of strange
Im just looking through crazy eyes
