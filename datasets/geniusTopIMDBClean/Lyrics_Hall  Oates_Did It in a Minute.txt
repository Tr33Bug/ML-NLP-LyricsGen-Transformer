When you find yourself alone
And when going out is coming home
Well you can count on the kid
Cause theres nobody waiting around oh oh
If youre not an easy mark
Its a shot in the dark that hits the heart
And I know I know I know I know when its coming
I thought so anyway
Some things stay the same
And some are due for change
I thought I had them all nailed down
But you turned it around
Oh you did it you did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
I know I know I know I know you did it
You did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute yeah you did it
Well I still cant say I know
When a love is real or touchandgo
And if two can be one
Who is the one two becomes oh oh
Am I quick enough to see
When Im ready and its right for me
I say I say I say I say that I want it
I think so anyway
Everybody always laughs at love
But what they want is to be proven wrong
Then you came along
Oh you did it you did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
I know I know I know I know oh you did it
You did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it yeah
I know I know I know I know you did it
You did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
I didnt really plan it
But you you did it you did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
I know I know I know oh
You did it you did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
I want someone to prove Im wrong
You did it you did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
I know I know I know I know oh you did it
You did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
You messin with my love life
You did it you did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
I know I know I know I know you did it
You did it you did it you did it
You did it in a minute you did it
Wow ooh wow ooh oh
