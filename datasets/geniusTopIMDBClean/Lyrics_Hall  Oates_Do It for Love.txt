I would fly ten thousand miles
In the pouring rain
Just to see your face
Id bare my soul to a total stranger
Just to say your name
And Im not ashamed
Just to love you into every morning
I would change my name
And run away
I wont do it for money
I wont do it for pride
I wont do it to please somebody else
If it dont feel right
But Ill do it for you
And at least Ill try
I dont need any other reason
Than I feel it deep inside
Ill Do It For Love
I would write your name across the sky
So the world could see
What you mean to me
Id sing songs at the top of my voice
In an empty room
Just to dance with you
And to love you into every morning
Ill leave the world behind
And Ill slow down time
I wont do it for money
I wont do it for pride
I wont do it to please somebody else
If it dont feel right
But Ill do it for you
And at least Ill try
I dont need any other reason
Than I feel it deep inside

Ill Do It For Love
What I do for love can take us anywhere at all
