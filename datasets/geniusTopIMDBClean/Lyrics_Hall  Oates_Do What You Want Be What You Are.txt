Do What You Want Be What You Are
Do what you want girl but be what you are
There aint no right or wrong way
Just a play from the heart
It aint a sign of weakness girl to give yourself away
Because the strong give up and move on
While the weak the weak give up and stay
So do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are 
Do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are 
Do you believe in hot cars
Leather bars and movie stars 
Is that whats real
Payin dues in earth shoes Chicago blues 
Is that how you feel
You can change you can change you can change you can change
But you cant conceal
Whats deep inside you
Its your game its your deal
Its your game its your deal
So do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are 
Do what you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
What you want to do
But be what you are
Be what you are 

Do what you want to girl
You can be what you want to
You can do what you want to
You can do you can be
You could do you could be
You can
