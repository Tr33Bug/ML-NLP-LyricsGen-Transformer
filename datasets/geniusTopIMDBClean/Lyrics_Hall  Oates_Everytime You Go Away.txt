Babe if we cant solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears
Whoa so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same thing
But cant you see weve got everything
Going on and on and on
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you you
Go on and go free
Maybe youre too close to see
I can feel your body move
But doesnt mean that much to me
I cant go on singing the same theme
Cause you cant see weve got everything
Baby even though you know
That everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
You just dont care everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you you
Cause you cant see weve got everything
Baby even though you know
That everytime you go away
Everytime you go away 
Everytime you go away 
Why you have to go away right now
Everytime you go away 
Everytime you go away 
Go on and go away girl
Everytime you go away 
I dont understand why you gotta go girl
Everytime you go away 
Go on and go free
Even though you mean so much to me
Everytime you go away 
I dont understand baby
Everytime you go away 
Oh baby baby everytime you go
Everytime you go away 
You dont know you dont know
Because you never understand girl
Everytime you go away 
Why you have to go away right now
Everytime you go away 
Everytime you go girl
Everytime you go away 
Go on go on and go free
Everytime you go away 
Baby you mean so much to me
Ill never understand why you gotta go girl
Everytime you go away 
I dont understand girl
Everytime you go away 
I dont know go I dont know go
I dont know go I dont know go

Everytime you go away 
Go girl go girl gotta go girl

Everytime you go away 
Baby baby baby
