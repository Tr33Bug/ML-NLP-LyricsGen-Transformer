Theres a thunder storm abrewin
And the day is turning gray
There aint much to say about the weather
The shower stall is leakin
And the ceilings fallin in
And Im getting twenty bills to every letter
Ive got to move myself out to the country
Im lookin out for any place at all
Im gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia
A roving band of youths beat up on Johnny
Everybodys gettin richer sellin that dope
Say the stolen bikes are gathering by the thousands
Along with seven million people without a hope
I guess I have to face the fact as real
I think I feel my back up against the wall
Im gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia
