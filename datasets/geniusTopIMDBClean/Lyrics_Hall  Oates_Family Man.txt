She had sulky smile
She took her standard pose as she presented herself
She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain that she was his for a price
But he said Leave me alone Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said Leave me alone Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might
She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her makeup to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night
But he said Leave me alone Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said Leave me alone Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might
She gave him her look
It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldnt decide if he should hold his ground
But he said Leave me alone Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said Leave me alone Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might
Yeah
She turned tossed her head
Unlike her opening move her final exit line
He waited much too long
But by the time he got his courage up she was gone
And he screamed  Leave me alone  Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said  Leave me alone  Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might
He said  Leave me alone  Im a  Family man 
And I dont think I want it tonight
And he said  Leave me alone  Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might
He said  Leave me alone  Im a family man
And my bark is much worse than my bite
He said  Leave me alone  Im a family man
If you push me too far I just might
He said  Leave me alone  Im a family man
Dont leave me alone cause I got to go home
Please  Leave me alone  Im a family man
And I dont think
