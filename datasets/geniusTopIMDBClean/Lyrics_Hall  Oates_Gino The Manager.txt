Gino  The Manager  LyricsYouve got Sicilian imagination
Second generation
And a long way from the family crime
But youve got your own way
Sign on the line sign on the line on the line
Youre a patentleather lover
With your GucciPucci pointed shoes
And youre swearing on your mother
That all this could be yours
Sign on the line sign on the line on the line
Remember hard work means something
Live fast die laughing
No hurt in asking
Nothing for nothing
Gino no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no
Youve got contractual agitation
Transcendental meditation works fine
But now youre paying off the guru
Get to heaven on time
Sign on the line sign on the line on the line
Remember hard work means something
Live fast die laughing
No hurt in asking
Nothing for nothing
You couldnt live without little Gino no
Thats what he tells me little Gino no
You couldnt live without little Gino no
Thats what he tells me little Gino no no
