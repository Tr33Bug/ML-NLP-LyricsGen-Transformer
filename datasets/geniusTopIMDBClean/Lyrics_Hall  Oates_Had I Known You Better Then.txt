Were you ever so in love you couldnt wait to get to sleep and dream
About the one you wish was there beside you
In the past few days Ive grown love your giggles on the phone
And how we hug so nicely
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then
I wouldve said those three old words
And from the first time I saw you
Had I known you better then
Now Im gonna move away another town another crazy day
Ooh I want to stay and maybe hang around you
Call it luck
Call it fate
Call it a shame that we have met so late
And loved so lightly
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then
I wouldve said those three old words
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then
Were you ever so in love
You couldnt wait to get to sleep and dream
About the one you wish was there beside you
And from the first time that I saw you
Had I known you better then
I wouldve said those three old words
And from the first time I saw you
Had I known you better then
Had I known you better then
Had I known had I known you better
Had I known had I known you better
Had I known had I known you better
