No more trying
To hold someone close to my life
Its time for finding
Some way to get through my sleepless nights
I can dream about you
If I cant hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Maybe that will make it all right
All right
Moving sidewalks
Uneven under my feet
My true feelings
Down deep below
Cause the streets see me lonely for you
Just for you
I can dream about you
In my dreams were still happy
And youre still part of me
I can dream about you
And when youre in my minds eye
Youre a sweet memory memory
Baby Im dreaming
I can dream about you 
Dreaming oh
I can dream about you
Oh maybe that will make it all right
All right all right
I can dream about you
