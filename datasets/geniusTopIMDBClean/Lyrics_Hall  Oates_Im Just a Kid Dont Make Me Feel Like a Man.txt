Im Just a Kid  Dont Make Me Feel Like a Man  LyricsLittle girl whats your name
Now dont you go looking at me like that
You might see Im ashamed  whats your name
Talk with me wont you talk with me
Ooooooh pretty girl
It aint too hip faking lines you aint taking
But your lips make me say it that way
Now theres no use you resisting
This is the Cradle Thief insisting
I think you better let me have it my way
Fool around with me come on mess around with me
Will you survive learn to drive
I know you cant describe the dreams you want to be
Either stay or get away
Im not playing around cant you tell the way Im squeezing
Your hand
Im just a kid dont make me feel like a man
Silly girl Im just playing
Now did you think that Id be nuts enough to try an pick you up
Dont you know its a game  its all a game Ive been playing
But whatd you say your name was
Walk with me just around the corner baby maybe you could even
Try to talk to me
Damn you talk to me
Damn you talk to me
