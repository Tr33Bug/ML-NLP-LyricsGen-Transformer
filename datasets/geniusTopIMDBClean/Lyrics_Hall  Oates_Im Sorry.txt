Iâ€™m Sorry LyricsWhy don't you write me
Call me on the phone
Send Western Union
You can find me home
I say I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry
You know I bled you
Led you on a lie
You say I fooled you
Who's the fool tonight
I say I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry
High
Love in motion
Walking on the ocean of your sorrow
Round turned the tables
Lost
I am a man with no tomorrow
Lopsided lovin' got me in the end
Looks like I'm done in
Now there's no pretending
Ooh I'm sorry
I said I'm sorryYou might also likeEmbed
