Why dont you write me
Call me on the phone
Send Western Union
You can find me home
I say Im sorry
I said Im sorry
You know I bled you
Led you on a lie
You say I fooled you
Whos the fool tonight
I say Im sorry
I said Im sorry
High
Love in motion
Walking on the ocean of your sorrow
Round turned the tables
Lost
I am a man with no tomorrow
Lopsided lovin got me in the end
Looks like Im done in
Now theres no pretending
Ooh Im sorry
I said Im sorry
