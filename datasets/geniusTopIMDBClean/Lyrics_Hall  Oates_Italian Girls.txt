I see I see I see
All the monumental illumination
I see I see I see
The greatest works of art in western civilization
Ooh but where are tell me where are
Ooh but where are the Italian girls
Faccia bella cara mia wont you tell me
Somebody tell me where are the Italian girls
Faccia bella cara mia
Somebody tell me where are the Italian girls
I drink I drink I drink
Too much vino rosso no more amarone
I eat I eat I eat
So much pasta basta Im so full and yet so lonely
Ooh but where are tell me where are
Ooh but where are the Italian girls
Faccia bella cara mia wont you tell me
Somebody tell me where are the Italian girls
Faccia bella cara mia
Somebody tell me where are the Italian girls
I see Sophia on the silver screena
There must be more like her in Roma
I believe I believe I believe
That she must be somewhere and I know Im gonna find her
Cause I need I need I need
Some little dream come true please tell me where theyre keeping you


Ooh but where are tell me where are
Ooh but where are the Italian girls
Faccia bella cara mia wont you tell me
Somebody tell me tell mewhere are the Italian girls
Faccia bella cara mia tell me now

Faccia bella cara mia
Somebody tell me where are the Italian girls
