You must be thinkin something
But you aint sayin nothing
You remember me
I used to be your boyfriend
There aint no point in reason
It only gets defensive
Why should we ruin the purity
Of the moment
Its a laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
What a laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
Its so stupid I gotta laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
Its a laugh  Its a laugh 
What a laugh  What a laugh 
Its so stupid that I gotta laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
And the odd thing is
I really thought that we were special
Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way
But I just look at myself
As if I were above me
You must be thinking something
But you aint saying nothing
You remember me
I have been here always
Its a laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
What a laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
Its so stupid I gotta laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
Its a laugh  Its a laugh 
What a laugh  What a laugh 
Its so stupid I gotta laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
And the odd thing is
I really thought we were special ohh
We were forever ahh
Its a laugh  Its a laugh 
What a laugh  What a laugh 
Its so stupid I gotta laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
And the funny thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
Its a laugh  Its a laugh 
What a laugh  What a laugh 
Its so stupid I gotta laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
And the odd thing is
I really thought we were special


So special its a laugh  Its a laugh 
What a laugh  What a laugh 
Its so stupid I gotta laugh  Whoo ooh ooh ooh 
And the odd thing is
Everyone thought we were forever
