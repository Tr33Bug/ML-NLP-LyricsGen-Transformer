Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin and blowin up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin and prancin in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time its the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin in a onehorse sleigh
Giddyup jingle horse pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and amingle in the jinglin feet
Thats the jingle bell rock
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
Dancin and prancin in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time its the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin in a onehorse sleigh
Giddyup jingle horse pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and amingle in the jinglin feet
Thats the jingle bell
Thats the jingle bell
Thats the jingle bell rock
