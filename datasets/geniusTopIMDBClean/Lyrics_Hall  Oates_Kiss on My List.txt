My friends wonder why I call you all the time what can I say
I dont feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help though I know Im right alright
Im just better off not listening to friends advice
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they wanna know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie then I tell them why
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss I cant resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light
I go crazy wonderin what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what Im doing I dont forget what I want what I want
Regret what Ive done regret you I couldnt go on
But if you insist on knowing my bliss
Ill tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie then Ill tell you why
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss I cant resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light
I really miss you babe
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh babe because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss I cant resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light
Because your kiss your kiss is on my list

Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Ohh because your kiss your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss I cant resist
