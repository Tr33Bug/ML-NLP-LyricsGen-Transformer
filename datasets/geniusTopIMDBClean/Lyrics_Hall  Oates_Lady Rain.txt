Lady Rain lay your soppin hair down on my shoulder
Lady Rain do your cloudy eyes see me much older
Can you see my past
Can you find my future
Should I take it slower til my life is over
Oh Lady Rain
Is it I wholl be going down in pain  yeah 
Lady Rain lay your soppin hair down on my shoulder  yeah 
Lady Rain do your cloudy eyes see me much older
All the days Ive lost hoping and pretending
That my life would flow smooth and slow toward its ending
Oh Lady Rain
Is it I wholl be going down in pain  yeah 
Instrumental break 
Lady Rain lay your soppin hair down on my shoulder  lay it down 
Lady Rain do your cloudy eyes see me much older
Can you see my past
Can you find my future
Should I take it slower til my life is over
Oh Lady Rain
Is it I wholl be going down in pain  yeah 
Is it I wholl be going down in pain  yeah

Is it I wholl be going down in pain  yeah

Is it I wholl be going down in pain  yeah
