Las Vegas Turnaround  The Stewardess Song  LyricsSaras off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land Las Vegas
Sometimes shes here and sometimes she cant be found
Turnaround
Saras off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land Las Vegas
Sometimes shes here and sometimes she cant be found
Turnaround
And Saras off half hiding far above the clouds high she flies
I know Ive got to find her a place she can push her toes around in
She needs a place where she can lounge and wear a gown in
Sara turnaround turn turnaround
Saras off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land Las Vegas
Sometimes shes here and sometimes she cant be found
Turnaround
Saras off on a turnaround
To Las Vegas sometimes shes not around
Turnaround
And any night
Well shes here or half way round the world oh I could cry
And so I know Ive got to pray for delays and for days til shes besides me
All alone in her room and her scattered clothes remind me
Sara please
Sara
Turnaround
Las Vegas turnaround
Sara please
Shes gone to Las Vegas
