In the moonlight
Under starlight
Songs old as the night are what Ive been dreaming of
Everybodys hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are made of a different stuff
I believe love will always be the same  Love 
The ways and means are the parts subject to change

I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you hurt me

Times too tight to fight
And were never face to face
Style is timeless and fashions only now  Love love love 
We got the ways no one needs to show us how
