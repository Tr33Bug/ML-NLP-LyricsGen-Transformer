Im tired of playing on the team
Ooh it seems I dont get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace face to face
No one even trying to score
Oh oh I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh yeah youve got to understand baby
Time out is what Im here for
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow ooh

One on one I wanna play that game tonight ooh
One on one I know I wanna play that game tonight  One on one ooh
