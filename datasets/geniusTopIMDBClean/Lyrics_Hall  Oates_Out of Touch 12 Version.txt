Out of Touch  12 Version  Lyrics
Out of touch out of touch
Out of touch out of touch
Out of touch out of time girl
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time  Time 
Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
Im waking up to fantasy
The shades all around arent the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
Were soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time  Time 
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time  Time 
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Oh ohohoh ohohoh
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch  Smoking guns 
Would cool down if we didnt use them so much yeah
Were soul alone
And soul really matters to me  Matters to me 
Too much  Too much 
Youre out of touch
Im out of time  Time 
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time  Time 
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Oh ohohoh ohohoh
Oooh
Oh ohohoh ohohoh
Out of touch out of touch
Out of time out of time
Ow
Out of touch out of touch
Out of touch out of touch
Out of touch out of time girl
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time  Time 
But Im out of my head when youre not around  Around 
Youre out of touch  Were soul alone girl 
Im out of time
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time  Out of touch 
But Im out of my head when youre not around  Out of time out of touch out of time girl 
Youre out of touch  Reach out for something to hold 
Time
But Im out of my head when youre not around  Too cold girl 
Youre out of touch  Too cold girl 
Im out of time  Too cold girl 
Yeah  Not around
Youre out of touch
Yeah Im out of time  Time 
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch   
Im out of time  Time 
Well still be one
Someday somehow girl
Out of touch out of time
But Im out of my head when youre not around
When youre not around  When youre not around 
When youre not around  When youre not around 
When youre not around not around
Girl youre not around no no
Im out of touch
Shake it up girl
Thats all we knew
These other things
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Time
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
Not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head when youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
