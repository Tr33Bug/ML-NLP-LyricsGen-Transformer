Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
Im waking up to fantasy
The shades all around arent the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
Were soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Ohohoh ohohoh
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didnt
Use them so much yeah
Were soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ooh
Oh ohohoh ohohoh
Out of touch 
Ow youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch  Were soul alone girl 
Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
Out of touch out of time out of touch out of time girl 
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch  Reach out for something to hold 
Time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre too cold girl too cold girl too cold girl yeah 
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
Not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
Out of touch out of time out of touch out of time 
Out of touch out of time girl 
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Yeah Im out of time
But Im out of my head
When youre not around
Youre out of touch
Im out of time
