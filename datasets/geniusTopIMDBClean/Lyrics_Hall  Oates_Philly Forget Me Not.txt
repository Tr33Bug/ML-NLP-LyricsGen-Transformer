Philly Forget Me Not Lyrics
I've been living outside of Philly
Yeah, I'm so far away
I've been gone for more than a minute
Is the neighbourhood the same?

All the kids on the corner
California never had that thing
I remember Rich Girl in the summer
Like yesterday
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)

Going back way low in seven
There was music all night
Oh and when the hands hit eleven
Pennsylvania came to life

All the kids on the corner
California never had that thing
I remember Rich Girl in the summer
(You're a rich girl)
Like yesterday

Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now, oohooh)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me)
You might also like
Every time I go away from ya
I can feel my mama wait for me
Philly I would never change on ya
You ain't always sunny honey
But you love me back

Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now
Just like yesterday)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)
Philly forget me not, forget me not, forget me not
(Come on Philly don't forget me now)Embed
