Ive been living outside of Philly
Yeah Im so far away
Ive been gone for more than a minute
Is the neighbourhood the same
All the kids on the corner
California never had that thing
I remember Rich Girl in the summer
Like yesterday
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Going back way low in seven
There was music all night
Oh and when the hands hit eleven
Pennsylvania came to life
All the kids on the corner
California never had that thing
I remember Rich Girl in the summer
Youre a rich girl 
Like yesterday
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now oohooh 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me 


Every time I go away from ya
I can feel my mama wait for me
Philly I would never change on ya
You aint always sunny honey
But you love me back
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now
Just like yesterday 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now 
Philly forget me not forget me not forget me not
Come on Philly dont forget me now
