Baby hair with a womans eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and were waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold you warm me
And when I feel I cant go on
You come and hold me
Its you and me forever
Sara smile
Oh wont you smile awhile for me Sara
If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why dont you stay until tomorrow
If you want to be free
You know all you got to do is say so
When you feel cold Ill warm you
And when you feel you cant go on
Ill come and hold you
Its you and me forever
Sara smile
Oh wont you smile awhile for me Sara
Sara smile
Oh wont you smile awhile Sara
Smile awhile
Oh wont you smile awhile for me Sara
Oh smile awhile
Wont you laugh Sara
Thank you for making me feel like a man
Not keeping me crazy crazy
Smile awhile
