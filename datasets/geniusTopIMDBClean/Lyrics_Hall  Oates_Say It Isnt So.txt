Say it
Say it isnt so
Say it
Say it isnt so
Say it isnt so painful
To tell me that youre dissatisfied
The last time I asked you I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen
You see em goin down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more
Say it 
Tell me what you want
Yeah Ill do it Baby I promise right now
Say it 
Who propped you up when you were stopped
Low motivation had you on the ground
I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide Away goodbye
But if theres a doubt maybe I can give out
A thousand reasons why you have to say it isnt so
It Isnt So 
Now Say It isnt So
It isnt so 
Now Say It isnt so
It isnt so 
Oh Say it isnt so
It isnt so 
Say it 
We like to be the strangers at the party
Two rebels in a shell
Say it 
You like to move with the best of them
You know we move so well
Dont need someone to lean on
I know why theres an open door
But if Im faced with being replaced
I want you even more
So baby say it isnt so
It Isnt So 
Now Say It isnt So
It isnt so 
Now Say It isnt so
It isnt so 
Oh Say it isnt so
It isnt so 
Say it
Say it isnt so
Say it
Say it isnt so
Say it
Say it isnt so
Why you wanna go
Do you have to say
You wanna go
Ooh oh Baby say it isnt

Why you have to say it isnt
