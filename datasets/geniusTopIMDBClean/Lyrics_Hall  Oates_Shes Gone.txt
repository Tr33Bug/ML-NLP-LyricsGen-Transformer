Everybodys high on consolation
Everybodys trying to tell me what is right for me yeah
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But its plain to see that they cant comfort me
Sorry Charlie for the imposition
I think I got it  got it  I got the strength to carry on oh yeah
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now its up to me ooh what will be
Shes gone shes gone
Oh I oh I
I better learn how to face it
Shes gone shes gone
Oh I oh I
Id pay the devil to replace her
Shes gone and shes gone
Oh why what went wrong
Get up in the morning look in the mirror
One less toothbrush hanging in the stand yeah
My face aint looking any younger
Now I can see loves taken a toll on me
Shes gone shes gone
Oh I oh I
I better learn how to face it
Shes gone and shes gone
Oh I oh I
Id pay the devil to replace her
Shes gone and shes gone
Oh why what went wrong
Think Ill spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away yeah
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
They can never be what she was  was  to  to  me
Shes gone shes gone
Oh I oh I
I better learn how to face it
Shes gone and shes gone
Oh I oh I
Id pay the devil to replace her
Shes gone and shes gone
Oh I what went wrong
Shes gone
Oh I I better learn how to face it
Shes gone shes gone
I cant believe that shes gone
Oh I Id pay the devil to replace her
Shes gone
Oh I I better learn how to face it
Shes gone shes gone
I cant believe that shes gone
Oh I Id pay the devil to replace her
Shes gone shes gone
Shes gone shes gone
Shes gone shes gone
