They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym
He fell like a rock she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder as they moved cross the floor
When the music was over she slipped out of his arms and out the door
Yeah a man loves a woman but he cant understand
Why shes sad when she stares at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club where the long shadows fall
Drops a coin in the jukebox not the phone on the wall
So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow maybe more than today
Were so close so close yet so far away
Some people think if you really believe
Thats what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yea I know someone who just heads for the sun
She says I dont wanna be wise I just wanna stay young
So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow though were stuck in today
Baby were so close so close yet so far away
Theres a restless look in your eye tonight
Theres a secret hurt in my heart
And the dream that pulls us together girl
Is a dream thats gonna tear us tear us apart
Theres a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh are you lookin for some way out of here
We gotta fight to keep it together girl
For the dream that keeps us
So close yet so far away
So close yet so far away
Who would of thought girl that wed end up this way
Getting so close so close
So far away
Were living in a dream world
Yet were livin today girl
Just you and me baby
Gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try gotta try
