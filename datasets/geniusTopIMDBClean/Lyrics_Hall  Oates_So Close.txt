So Close LyricsThey met on the dance floor in the old high school gym
He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him
And his heart beat like thunder, as they moved cross the floor
When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms, and out the door
Yeah a man loves a woman, but he can't understand
Why she's sad when she stares, at the ring on her hand
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall
Drops a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall
So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today
We're so close, so close, yet so far away
Some people think, if you really believe
That's what you need to solve all the mysteries
Yea I know someone, who just heads for the sun
She says "I don't wanna be wise, I just wanna stay young"
So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
We believe in tomorrow, though we're stuck in today
Baby we're so close, so close, yet so far away
There's a restless look in your eye tonight
There's a secret hurt in my heart
And the dream that pulls us together girl
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart
There's a restless look in your eye tonight
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here
We gotta fight to keep it together girl
For the dream, that keeps us
So close, yet so far away
So close, yet so far away
Who would of thought girl that we'd end up this way
Getting so close, so close
So far away

Yet we're livin' today girl
Just you and me baby
Gotta try, gotta try, gotta try, gotta try, gotta try, gotta try, gotta tryEmbed
