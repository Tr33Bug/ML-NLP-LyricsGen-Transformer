I feel like I could run away
Looking at a darker day
Oh Im pulling the shades away from my eyes
Its true the moody manners come and go
And its better that you never know
Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings are better left undone
Some hearts are better left unbroken
Some lives are better left untouched
Some lies are better off believed
Some words are better left unspoken
My ideas seem to frighten you
Are you really that afraid to move
Oh I guess that its your right to reason
Im still dealing with a force thats so strong
The force is stringing us along
Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings are better left undone
Some hearts are better left unbroken
Some lives are better left untouched
Some lies are better off believed
Some words are better left unspoken
Youre livin a lie
Thats the only thing I can say
Ooh some things are better left
Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lives are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some hearts are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lies are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some things are better left
Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lives are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some hearts are better
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lies are better ooh
Some things are better left unsaid
Some things are better left
Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings
Some things are better left unsaid
Some lives are better
Some things are better left unsaid
