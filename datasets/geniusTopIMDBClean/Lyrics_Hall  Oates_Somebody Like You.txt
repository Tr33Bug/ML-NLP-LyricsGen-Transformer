Only you could ever know
How hard it was for me to let you go
Hard to face all those nights
And suffer thru all the fools advice
Seems tome its not so bad
To try for the kind of love that we had
Oh I need that romance
One that grows strong
When its got no chance
Now youre gone away
And Im left to carry on
Aint nobody else gonna bear up to comparison
And if I cant have the real thing
Then Ive got to find someone
Just like you
What you got its what you need
Theres pain in that but its plain enough to see
I know I was satisfied
But nobody else came out of my side
I hope someone will come today
Somebody like you
Someone to take me all the way
Somebody like you
Someone to take your place
Somebody like you
Someone to fill this empty space
