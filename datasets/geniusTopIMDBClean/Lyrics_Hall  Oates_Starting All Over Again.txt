Starting all over again is gonna be rough so rough
But were gonna make it
Starting all over as friends is gonna be rough on us
But we gotta face it
We lost what we had
Thats why it hurt so bad
It set us back a thousand years
Were gonna make it up
Though its gonna be rough
To erase all the hurt and tears
Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But I pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
But we both know that we can make it
We gotta take life as it comes
And never worry about whos right or wrong
Its an uphill climb
To the finish line
Were gonna try to make it
One more time
Starting all over again is gonna be rough so rough
But were gonna make it
Starting all over as friends is gonna be tough on us
But we gotta face it
Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But I pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
We both know that were gonna make it
