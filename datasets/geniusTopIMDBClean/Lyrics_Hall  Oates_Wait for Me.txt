Midnight hour almost over
Time is running out for the magic pair
I know you gave the best that you have
But one more chance
Couldnt be all that hard to bear
Wait for me please
Wait for me oh
I guess thats more than I should ask
But wont you wait for me  Wait for me 
Please wait for me  Wait for me 
Although I know the light is fading fast
You could go either way
Is it easier to stay
I wonder what youll do
When your chance rolls around
But you gotta know how much I want to keep you
When Im away Im afraid it will all fall down
So wait for me please
Wait for me alright
AI guess thats more than I should ask
But wont you wait for me  Wait for me 
Although I know the light is fading fast
LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa  x4 
Love is what it does and ours is doing nothing
But all the time we spent it must be good for something
Please forgive all the disturbance Im creating
But you got a lot to learn if you think that Im not waiting for you
So wait for me please
Wait for me oh
I I guess thats more than I should ask
So wont you wait for me  Wait for me 
Please wait for me  For me 
Oh God I know the light is fading fast yes it is
