I went downtown to see milady
She stood me up and I stood there waiting
But itll be all right when the morning comes
Now Im up in the air with the rain in my hair
Ive got nowhere to go I can go anywhere
And itll be all right when the morning comes
Just in passing Im not asking that you can be anyone but you
But when you come home try to come home alone
Its so much better with two
Now Im out in the cold and Im getting old
Standing here waiting on you
Itll be all right when the Morning Comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
Just in passing Im not asking that you can be anyone but you
But when you come home try to come home alone
Its so much better with two
Now Im out in the cold and Im getting old
Standing here waiting on you
Itll be all right when the Morning Comes
When the morning comes
Itll be alright
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
