What I want youve got and it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle the candle feeds the flame
Yeah what Ive got full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
And you pull them all together and how I cant explain
Well well well you
You make my dreams come true
You  You you ooh ooh ooh you 
Well well well you
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true
You you you ooh ooh ooh you 
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When theyre messing with the dreamer I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
Cause I aint the way you found me and Ill never be the same
Well well well you
You make my dreams come true
You  You you ooh ooh ooh you 
Well well well you
You make my dreams come true
You you you ooh ooh ooh you 
Well listen to this
