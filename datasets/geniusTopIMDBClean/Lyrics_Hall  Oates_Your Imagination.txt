I remember when I used to be the jealous kind
I got over it now youre taking over my old line
Youre caring too much about what I say  Your imagination 
Youre wondering too much about what I do  Your imagination 
And baby your imagination now  Your imagination 
Imaginations got the best of you  Your imagination 
I aint doin nothing that you could really say was wrong
Just one oversight and no that didnt last too long
Youre caring too much about what I say  Your imagination 
Youre wondering too much about what I do  Your imagination 
And baby your imagination now  Your imagination 
Imaginations got the best of you  Your imagination 
I dont know what youre looking for woah
Whats this thing all about true blue oh yeah
You know I aint no danger boy
Cause youre the one I like to touch touch you
You you you
Yeah when the mood is right
Change the light and the moments gone
You better turn around cause the light doesnt last too long
You see youre caring too much about what I say  Your imagination 
Youre wondering too much about what I do  Your imagination 
And baby your imagination now  Your imagination 
Imaginations got the best of you  Your imagination 
Your imagination  Use your imagination 
Oh your imagination  Use your imagination 
Oh baby your imagination  Use your imagination 
Oh baby your imagination  Use your imagination 
Baby baby your imagination  Use your imagination 
Baby baby your imagination  Use your imagination 
Oh baby oh baby
Your imagination
Your imagination
