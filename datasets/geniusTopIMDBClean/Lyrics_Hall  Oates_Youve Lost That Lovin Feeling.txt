You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And theres no tenderness like before in your fingertips
Youre trying hard not to show it
But baby baby I know it
You lost that lovin feelin
Oh that lovin feeling
You lost that lovin feelin
Now its gone gone gone oh oh oh
No theres no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl youre starting to criticize little things I do
Ooh it makes me just feel like cryin
Cause baby something beautifuls dying
You lost that lovin feelin
Oh that lovin feeling
You lost that lovin feelin
Now its gone gone gone oh oh oh
Baby baby I get down on my knees for you
Get down on my knees 
If you would only love me like you used to do
If you would only love me love me 
We had a love a love a love you dont find everyday
A love you dont find 
So dont dont dont let it slip away  Away 
I said baby baby baby baby
Im beggin you please  Im beggin you please
I need your love  I need your love

So bring it on back  Bring it on back 
Now bring it on back

Youve got to bring back that lovin feelin
Oh that lovin feelin

Cause its gone gone gone
And I cant go on oh oh oh
