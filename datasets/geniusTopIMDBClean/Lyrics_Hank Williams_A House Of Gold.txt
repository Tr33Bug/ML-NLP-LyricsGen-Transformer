People steal they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
Dont they know on the judgement day
That their gold and silver will melt away
Id rather be in a deep dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
Jesus said come on to me
Ill break sins chains and set you free
Ill carry you to a home on high
Where youll never never die
What good is gold and silver too
When your hearts not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray
Jesus died there on the cross
So this world would not be lost
Sinner hear now what I say
For someday youll have to pay
What good is gold and silver too
If your hearts not good and true
Sinner hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray
