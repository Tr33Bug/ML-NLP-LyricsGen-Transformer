Tonight down here in the valley
Im lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill
Do you recall when we parted
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill
Ive waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real
Cause I know youre living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill
The light shine bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know youre alone with your pride dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill
