A Mansion on the Hill Lyrics
Tonight down here in the valley
I'm lonesome, and oh, how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill


Do you recall when we parted?
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years, love
To give you a heart true and real
'Cause I know you're living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill

The light shine bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hillYou might also like5Embed
