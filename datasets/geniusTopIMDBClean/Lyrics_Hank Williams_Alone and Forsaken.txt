Alone and Forsaken Lyrics
We met in the springtime
When blossoms unfold
The pastures were green
And the meadows were gold

Our love was in flower
As summer grew on
Her love, like the leaves
Now has withered and gone
The roses have faded
There's frost at my door
The birds in the morning
Don't sing anymore

The grass in the valley
Is starting to die
And out in the darkness
The whip-poor-wills cry

Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh, lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh, please understand

Oh, where has she gone to
Oh, where can she be?
She may have forsaken
Some other like me

She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow was a plaything
That she threw away
You might also like
The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance
Is starting to bay

I wonder, I wonder
What she's thinking of?
Forsaken, forgotten
Without any love

Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh, lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh, please understand4Embed
