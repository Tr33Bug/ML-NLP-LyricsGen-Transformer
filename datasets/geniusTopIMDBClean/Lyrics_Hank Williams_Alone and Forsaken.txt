We met in the springtime
When blossoms unfold
The pastures were green
And the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower
As summer grew on
Her love like the leaves
Now has withered and gone
The roses have faded
Theres frost at my door
The birds in the morning
Dont sing anymore
The grass in the valley
Is starting to die
And out in the darkness
The whippoorwills cry
Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh please understand
Oh where has she gone to
Oh where can she be
She may have forsaken
Some other like me
She promised to honor
To love and obey
Each vow was a plaything
That she threw away
The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance
Is starting to bay
I wonder I wonder
What shes thinking of
Forsaken forgotten
Without any love
Alone and forsaken
By fate and by man
Oh lord if you hear me
Please hold my hand
Oh please understand
