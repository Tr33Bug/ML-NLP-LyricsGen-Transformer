Oh a Cherokee chief
As he dances along
He does an Indian boogie
To a white mans song
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina
Singin hey ho a lina
A well a hey ho a lina wup wup a witten a yeah
Well he dances over here
And he dances over there
And he dances with his squaw
Called standing bare
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina
Singin hey ho a lina
Oh a hey ho a lina wup wup a witten a yeah
Well he dances in a truck
And he dances on the rock
But he keep on shakin
His old tomahawk
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina
Singin hey ho a lina
Oh a hey ho a lina wup wup a witten a yeah
Now he sings a little soft
And he sings a little loud
Blue blue clouds
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina
Singin hey ho a lina hey ho a lina

Oh a hey ho a lina wup wup a witten a yeah

Ooh a hey ho a lina wup wup a witten a yeah
