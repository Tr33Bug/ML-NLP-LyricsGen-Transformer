Cherokee Boogie LyricsOh, a Cherokee chief
As he dances along
He does an Indian boogie
To a white man's song
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina
A well, a hey ho a lina, wup wup, a witten a yeah
Well, he dances over here
And he dances over there
And he dances with his squaw
Called standing bare
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina
Oh, a hey ho a lina, wup wup, a witten a yeah
Well, he dances in a truck
And he dances on the rock
But he keep on shakin'
His old tomahawk
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina
Oh, a hey ho a lina, wup wup, a witten a yeah
Now, he sings a little soft
And he sings a little loud
Blue, blue clouds
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina, hey ho a lina
Singin' hey ho a lina
Oh, a hey ho a lina, wup wup, a witten a yeah
He's a Cherokee cheif
As all might know
When he sings his boogie
Singin' nuven-yo

Singin' hey ho a lina
Ooh, a hey ho a lina, wup wup, a witten a yeahEmbed
