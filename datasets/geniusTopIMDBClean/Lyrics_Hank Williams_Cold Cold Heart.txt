I tried so hard my dear to show that youre my every dream
Yet youre afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didnt do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Youll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet youre afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just aint smart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
