All day Ive faced the barren waste
With out the taste of water cool water
Ole Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water cool clear water
The nights are cool and Im a fool
Each stars a pool of water cool clear water
And with the dawn Ill wake and yawn
And carry on
To water cool clear water
The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water cool clear water
And way up there Hell hear our prayer
And show us where
Theres water cool clear water
Keep amovin Dan Dont you listen to him Dan
Hes the devil not a man
He spreads the burnin sand with water
Say Dan cant you see that big green tree
Where the waters runnin free
Its waiting there for you and me
And water cool clear water
Dans feet are sore hes yearnin for
Just one thing more than water cool clear water
Like me I guess hed like to rest
Where theres no quest
For water cool clear water
