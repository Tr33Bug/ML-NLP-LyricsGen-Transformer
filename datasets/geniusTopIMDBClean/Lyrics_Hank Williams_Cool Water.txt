Cool Water LyricsAll day I've faced the barren waste
With out the taste of water... cool, water
Ole Dan and I, with throats burned dry
And souls that cry
For water... cool, clear water
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water... cool, clear water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on
To water... cool, clear water
The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water.... cool, clear water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where
There's water... cool, clear water
Keep a-movin' Dan. Don't you listen to him Dan
He's the devil, not a man
He spreads the burnin' sand with water
Say Dan can't you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
It's waiting there for you and me
And water.... cool, clear water
Dan's feet are sore he's yearnin' for
Just one thing more than water.... cool, clear water
Like me I guess he'd like to rest
Where there's no quest
For water... cool, clear waterYou might also like1Embed
