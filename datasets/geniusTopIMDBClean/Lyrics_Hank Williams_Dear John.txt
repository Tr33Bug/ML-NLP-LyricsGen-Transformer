Well when I woke up this mornin
There was a note upon my door
Said dont make me no coffee Babe
cause I wont be back no more
And thats all she wrote Dear John
Ive sent your saddle home
Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale
Daniel in the lions den
But I know a guy that didnt try to get along
And he wont get a chance again
And thats all she wrote Dear John
Ive fetched your saddle home
Well she didnt forward no address
Nor she didnt say goodbye
All she said was if you get blue
Just hang your little head and cry
And thats all she wrote Dear John
Ive sent your saddle home
Now my gals short and stubby
Shes strong as she can be
But if that little old gal of mine
Ever gets ahold of me
Thats all she wrote Dear John
Ive sent your saddle home
Now Jonah got along in the belly of the whale
Daniel in the lions den
But I know a man that didnt try to get along
And he wont get a chance again
And thats all she wrote Dear John
Ive fetched your saddle home
Now I went down to the bank this morning
The cashier said with a grin
I feel so sorry for you Hank
But your wife has done been in
And thats all she wrote Dear John
Ive sent your saddle home
