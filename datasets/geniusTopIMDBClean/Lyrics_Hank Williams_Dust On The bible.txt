I went into a home one day just to see some friends of mine
Of all their books and magazines not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible when they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered oer it not a fingerprint was plain
Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books youll find theres none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
Oh you can read your magazines of love and tragic things
But not one word of Bible verse not a scripture do you know
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
But its dust is covered oer it
And its sure to doom your poor soul
Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books youll find theres none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
Oh if you have a friend youd like to help along lifes way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burdens light
Is to dust the family bible trades the wrong way for the right
Dust on the Bible dust on the Holy Word
The word of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books youll find theres none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
