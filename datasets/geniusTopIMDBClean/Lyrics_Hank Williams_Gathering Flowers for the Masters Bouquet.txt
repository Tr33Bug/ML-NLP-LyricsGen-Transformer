Death is an angel sent down from above sent for the buds of the flowers we love
But every bud and each blossom some day
Will bloom as a flower in the Masters bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Masters bouquet beautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by angels then carried away forever to bloom in the Masters bouquet
Loved ones are passing each day and each hour passing away as the life of a flower
Taken and cared for in heavens own way forever to bloom in the Masters bouquet
Gathering flowers for the Masters bouquetbeautiful flowers that will never decay
Gathered by angels then carried away forever to bloom in the Masters bouquet
