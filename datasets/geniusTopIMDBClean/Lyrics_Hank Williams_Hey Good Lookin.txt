Say hey good lookin  what ya got cookin
Hows about cookin somethin up with me
Hey sweet baby  dont you think maybe
We can find us a brand new recipe
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
Theres soda pop and the dancings free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me
Say hey good lookin  what ya got cookin
Hows about cooking somethin up with me
Im free and ready so we can go steady
Hows about savin all your time for me
No more lookin I know I been tookin
Hows about keepin steady company
Im gonna throw my date book over the fence
And buy me one for five or ten cents
Ill keep it till its covered with age
Cause Im writin your name down on ever page
Say hey good lookin  what ya got cookin
Hows about cookin somethin up with me
