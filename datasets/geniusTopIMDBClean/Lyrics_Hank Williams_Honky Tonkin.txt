When you are sad and lonely and have no place to go
Come to see me baby and bring along some dough
And well go honky tonkin honky tonkin
Honky tonkin honey baby
Well go honky tonkin round this town
When you and your baby have a fallin out
Call me up sweet mama and well go steppin out
And well go honky tonkin honky tonkin
Honky tonkin honey baby
Well go honky tonkin round this town
Were goin into the city to the city fair
If you go to the city baby you will find me there
And well go honky tonkin honky tonkin
Honky tonkin honey baby
Well go honky tonkin round this town
Were goin honky tonkin honky tonkin
Honky tonkin honey baby
Were goin honky tonkin round this town
