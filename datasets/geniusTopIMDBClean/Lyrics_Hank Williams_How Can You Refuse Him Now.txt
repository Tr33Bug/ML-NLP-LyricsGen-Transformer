How can you refuse Him now how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
Theres a story old that has often been told
Of how our Saviour died as they nailed His hands
He cried they dont understand
As the blood flowed from His side
How can you refuse Him now how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
As He hung there on the tree He prayed for you and me
There was no one His pain to ease
Before He died He faintly cried
Father forgive them please
How can you refuse Him now how can you refuse Him now
How can you turn away from His side
With tears in His eyes on the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now
