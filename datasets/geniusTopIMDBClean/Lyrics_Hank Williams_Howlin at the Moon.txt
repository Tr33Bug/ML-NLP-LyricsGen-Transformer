I know theres never been a man in the awful shape Im in
I cant even spell my name my heads in such a spin
Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old tablespoon
You got me chasin rabbits walkin on my hands and howlin at the moon
Well I took one look at you and it almost drove me mad
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had
Now I cant tell the day from night Im crazy as a loon
You got me chasin rabbits pullin out my hair and howlin at the moon
Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin spree
Cause there aint a hound dog in this state that can hold a light to me
I ate three bones for dinner today then tried to tree a coon
You got me chasin rabbits scratchin fleas and howlin at the moon
I rode my horse to town to day and a gas pump we did pass
I pulled im up and I hollered whoa said fill im up with gas
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham he changed my tune
You got me chasin rabbits spittin out teeth and howlin at the moon
I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard
But honey baby when I fell the whole world must have jarred
I think Id quit my doggish ways if youd take me for your groom
You got me chasin rabbits pickin out rings and howlin at the moon
