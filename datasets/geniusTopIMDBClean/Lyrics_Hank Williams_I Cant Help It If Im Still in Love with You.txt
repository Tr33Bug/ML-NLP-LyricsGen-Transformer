I Cant Help It  If Im Still in Love with You  LyricsToday I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealin
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly I got that old time feelin
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
Its hard to know anothers lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh Heaven only knows how much I miss you
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
