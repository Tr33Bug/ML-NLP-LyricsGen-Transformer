I Heard That  Lonesome Whistle LyricsI was ridin number nine
Headin south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
Got in trouble had to roam
Left my gal and left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
Just a kid actin smart
I went and broke my darlins heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All alone I bear the shame
Im a number not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
When the evnin train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
Ill be locked here in this cell
Til my bodys just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
Ill never see that gal of mine
Lord Im in Georgia doin time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
