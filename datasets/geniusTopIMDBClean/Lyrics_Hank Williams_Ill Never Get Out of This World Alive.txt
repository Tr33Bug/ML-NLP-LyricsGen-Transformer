Now youre lookin at a man thats gettin kinda mad
I had lots of luck but its all been bad
No matter how I struggle and strive
Ill never get out of this world alive
My fishin poles broke the creek is full of sand
My woman run away with another man
No matter how I struggle and strive
Ill never get out of this world alive
A distant uncle passed away
And left me quite a batch
And I was living high until that fatal day
A lawyer proved I wasnt born I was only hatched
Every things agin me and its got me down
If I jumped in the river I would probably drown
No matter how I struggle and strive
Ill never get out of this world alive
These shabby shoes Im wearin all the time
Is full of holes and nails
And brother if I stepped on a worn out dime
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails
Im not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow
Cause nothins ever gonna be alright nohow
No matter how I struggle and strive
Ill never get out of this world alive
