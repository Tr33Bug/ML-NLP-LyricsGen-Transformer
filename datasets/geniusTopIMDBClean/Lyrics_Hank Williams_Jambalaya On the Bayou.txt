Jambalaya  On the Bayou  Lyrics
Goodbye Joe me gotta go me oh my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne the sweetest one me oh my oh
Son of me gun well have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a fil gumbo
Cause tonight Im gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar filled fruit jar and be gayo
Son of me gun well have big fun on the bayou
Thibodaux Fontaineaux the place is buzzin
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dressed in style go hog wild oh me oh my oh
Son of me gun well have big fun on the bayou
Settle down far from town get me a pirogue
And Ill catch all the fish in the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a fil gumbo
Cause tonight Im gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar filled fruit jar and be gayo
Son of me gun well have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a fil gumbo
Cause tonight Im gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar filled fruit jar and be gayo
Son of me gun well have big fun on the bayou
Son of me gun well have big fun on the bayou
Later on swap my mon get me a pirogue
And Ill catch all the fish on the bayou
Swap my mon to buy Yvonne what she needoh
Son of a gun well have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie
