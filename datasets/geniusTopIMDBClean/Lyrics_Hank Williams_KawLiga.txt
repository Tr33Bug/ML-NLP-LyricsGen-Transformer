KawLiga was a wooden Indian standing by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
KawLiga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday hed talk
KawLiga too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart is made of knotty pine
Poor old KawLiga he never got a kiss
Poor old KawLiga he dont know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red
KawLiga that poor old wooden head
KawLiga was a lonely Indian never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair
KawLiga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no
And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh so far away but old KawLiga stayed
KawLiga just stands there as lonely as can be
And wishes he was still an old pine tree
Poor old KawLiga he never got a kiss
Poor old KawLiga he dont know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red
KawLiga that poor old wooden head
