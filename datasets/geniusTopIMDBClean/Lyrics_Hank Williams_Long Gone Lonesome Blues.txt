I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die oh Lord
And then I jumped in the river but the doggone river was dry
Shes long gone and now Im lonesome blue
I had me a woman who couldnt be true
She made me for my money and she made me blue
A man needs a woman that he can lean on
But my leanin post is done left and gone
Shes long gone and now Im lonesome blue
Im gonna find me a river one thats cold as ice
And when I find me that river Lord Im gonna pay the price oh Lord
Im goin down in it three times but Lord Im only comin up twice
Shes long gone and now Im lonesome blue
She told me on Sunday she was checkin me out
Long about Monday she was nowhere about
And here it is Tuesday aint had no news
I got them gone but not forgotten blues
Shes long gone and now Im lonesome blue
