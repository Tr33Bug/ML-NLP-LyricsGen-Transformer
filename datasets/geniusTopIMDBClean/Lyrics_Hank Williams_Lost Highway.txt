Im a rolling stone all alone and lost
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another boy down the lost highway
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a womans lies make a life like mine
Oh the day we met I went astray
I started rollin down that lost highway
I was just a lad nearly twentytwo
Neither good nor bad just a kid like you
And now Im lost too late to pray
Lord Ive paid the cost on the lost highway
Now boys dont start your ramblin round
On this road of sin or youre sorrow bound
Take my advice or youll curse the day
You started rollin down that lost highway
