I got a feeling called the blues oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I dont know what Ill do
All I do is sat and sigh Oh Lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
Shell do me shell do you shes got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think its all over Ive lost my heart it seems
Ive grown so used to you somehow
But Im nobodys sugar daddy now
And Im lonesome I got the lovesick blues
Well Im in love Im in love with a beautiful gal
Thats whats the matter with me
Well Im in love Im in love with a beautiful gal
But she dont care about me
Lord I tried and I tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldnt stay
So now that she is leaving this is all I can say
I got a feeling called the blues oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord I dont know what Ill do
All I do is sat and sigh Oh Lord
The last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord I thought I would cry
Shell do me shell do you shes got that kind of loving
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think its all over Ive lost my heart it seems
Ive grown so used to you somehow
But Im nobodys sugar daddy now
And Im lonesome I got the lovesick blues
