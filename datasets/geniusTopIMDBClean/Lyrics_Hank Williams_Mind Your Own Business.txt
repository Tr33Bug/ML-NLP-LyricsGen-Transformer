If the wife and I are fussin brother thats our right
Cause me and that sweet womans got a license to fight
Why dont you mind your own business
Mind your own business
Cause if you mind your business then you wont be mindin mine
Oh the woman on our party lines the nosiest thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows its my ring
Why dont you mind your own business
Mind your own business
Cause if you mind your business then you wont be mindin mine
I got a little gal that wears her hair up high
The boys all whistle when she walks by
Why dont you mind your own business
Mind your own business
Well if you mind your business then you sure wont be mindin mine
If I want to honky tonk around til two or three
Now brother thats my headache dont you worry bout me
Just mind your own business
Mind your own business
If you mind your business then you wont be mindin mine


Mindin other peoples business seems to be hightoned
I got all that I can do just to mind my own
Why dont you mind your own business
Mind your own business
If you mind your own business youll stay busy all the time
