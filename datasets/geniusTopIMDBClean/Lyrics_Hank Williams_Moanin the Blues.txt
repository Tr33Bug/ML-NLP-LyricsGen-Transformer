When my baby moved out and the blues moved in
There wasnt nothin I could do
But mosey around with my head in my hands
Lord what am I comin to
I just keep Moanin
Moaoanin the blues
I wrote a nice long letter
Sayin mama please come home
Your dadaddy is lononesome
And all I do is moan 
I been lovin that gal for so doggone long
I cant afford to lose her now
I thought I was right but I must of been wrong
Cause my head is startin to bow
And now Im Moanin
Moaoanin The Blues
If you want a good gal to stay around
You gotta treat her nice and kind
If you do her wrong shell leave this town
And youll almost lose your mind
Then youll moanin Moaoanin The Blues
Aw baby baby baby
Honey baby please come home
Your dadaddy is lononesome and all I do is moan
I promise you baby that Ill be good
And Ill never be bad no more
Im sittin here waitin for you right now
To walk through that front door
Then Ill stop moanin Moaoanin The Blues
