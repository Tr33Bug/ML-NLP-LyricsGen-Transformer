Came in last night at a half past ten
That baby of mine wouldnt let me in
So move it on over  move it on over 
Move it on over  move it on over 
Move over little dog cause a big dogs movin in
Shes changed the lock on our front door
My door key dont fit no more
So get it on over  move it on over 
Scoot it on over  move it on over 
Move over skinny dog cause a fat dogs moving in
This dog house here is mighty small
But its sure better than no house at all
So ease it on over  move it on over 
Drag it on over  move it on over 
Move over old dog cause a new dogs moving in
She told me not to play around
But I done let the deal go down
So pack it on over  move it on over 
Tote it on over  move it on over 
Move over nice dog cause a mad dogs moving in
She warned me once she warned me twice
But I dont take no ones advice
So scratch it on over  move it on over 
Shake it on over  move it on over 
Move over short dog cause a tall dogs moving in
Shell crawl back to me on her knees
Ill be busy scratching fleas
So slide it on over  move it on over 
Sneak it on over  move it on over 
Move over good dog cause a mad dogs moving in
Remember pup before you whine
That sides yours and this sides mine
So shove it on over  move it on over 
Sweep it on over  move it on over 
Move over cold dog cause a hot dogs moving in
