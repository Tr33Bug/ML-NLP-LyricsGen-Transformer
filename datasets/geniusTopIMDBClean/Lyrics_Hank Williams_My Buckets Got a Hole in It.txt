Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
I cant buy no beer
Well Im standin on a corner  With a bucket in my hand
Im waitin for a woman  That aint got no man
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
I cant buy no beer
Well I went upon the mountain  I looked down in the sea
I seen the crabs and the fishes  Doin the bebopbee
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
I cant buy no beer
Well there aint no use  of me workin so hard
When I got a woman  in the boss mans yard
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
I cant buy no beer
Well me and my baby  we just bought a Ford
And now we sit together  on the running board
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
Yea My buckets got a hole in it
I cant buy no beer
