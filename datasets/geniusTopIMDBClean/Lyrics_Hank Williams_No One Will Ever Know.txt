No one will ever know my heart is breaking
Although a million teardrops start to flow
Ill cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
Ill miss you but no one will ever know
Ill tell them we grew tired of each other
And realized our dreams could never be
Ill even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me
No one will ever know how much Im pineing
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No one will ever see the tears Im hiding
Youve hurt me but no one will ever know
Ill tell then I found true love with another
That I was glad the day you set me free
Ill even make believe I never loved you
Then no one will ever know the truth but me
