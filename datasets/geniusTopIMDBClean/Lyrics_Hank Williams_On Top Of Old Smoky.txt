On top of old Smokey all covered in snow
I lost my true lover by courtin too slow
On top of old Smokey I went there to weep
For a false hearted lover is worse than a thief
A thief he will rob you and take what you save
But a false hearted lover will put you in your grave
On top of old Smokey all covered in snow
I lost my true lover by courtin too slow
Theyll hug you and kiss you then tell you more lies
Than the crossties on the railroad or the stars in the skies
On top of old Smoke all covered in snow
I lost my true lover by courtin too slow
