Precious Lord take my hand
Lead me on
Let me stand
Im tired I am weak I am worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry
Hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
Guide my feet
Hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
Precious Lord take my hand
Lead me on
Let me stand
I am tired I am weak I am worn
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord lead me home
