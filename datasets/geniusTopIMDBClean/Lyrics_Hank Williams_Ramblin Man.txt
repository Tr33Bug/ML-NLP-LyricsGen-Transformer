I can settle down and be doin just fine
Til I hear an old train rollin down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didnt go I believe Id blow my stack
I love you baby but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me he made a ramblin man
Some folks might say that Im no good
That I wouldnt settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin me
Theres somethin oer the hill that I gotta see
Sometimes its hard but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me He made a ramblin man
I love to see the towns apassin by
And to ride these rails neath Gods blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
Cause thats the life I believe He meant for me
And when Im gone and at my grave you stand
Just say Gods called home your ramblin man
