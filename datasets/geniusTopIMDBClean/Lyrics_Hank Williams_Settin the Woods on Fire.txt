Comb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and Ill act prouder
You sing loud and Ill sing louder
Tonight were settin the woods on fire
Youre my gal and Im your feller
Dress up in your frock of yeller
Ill look swell but youll look sweller
Settin the woods on fire
Well take in all the honky tonks
Tonight were having fun
Well show the folks a brand new dance
That never has been done
I dont care who thinks were silly
Youll be daffy Ill be dilly
Well order up two bowls of chili
Settin the woods on fire
Ill gas up my hot rod stoker
Well get hotter than a poker
Youll be broke but Ill be broker
Tonight were settin the woods on fire
Well sit close to one another
Up one street and down the other
Well have a time oh brother
Settin the woods on fire
Well put aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My tires and tubes are doin fine
But the air is showin through
You clap hands and Ill start bowin
Well do all the laws allowin
Tomorrow Ill be right back plowin
Settin the woods on fire
