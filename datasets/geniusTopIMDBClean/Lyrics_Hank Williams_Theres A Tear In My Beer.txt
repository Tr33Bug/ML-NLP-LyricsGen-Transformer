Theres a tear in my beer
Cause Im crying for you dear
You are on my lonely mind
Into these last nine beers
I have shed a million tears
You are on my lonely mind
Im gonna keep drinkin until Im petrified
And then maybe these tears will leave my eyes
Theres a tear in my beer
Cause Im crying for you dear
You were on my lonely mind
Last night I walked the floor
And the night before
You were on my lonely mind
It seems my life is through
And Im so doggone blue
You are on my lonely mind
Im gonna keep drinkin til I cant move a toe
And then maybe my heart wont hurt me so
Theres a tear in my beer
Cause Im crying for you dear
You were on my lonely mind
Lord Ive tried and Ive tried
But my tears I cant hide
You are on my lonely mind
All these blues that Ive found
Have really got me down
You are on my lonely mind
Im gonna keep drinkin til I cant even think
Cause in the last week I aint slept a wink
Theres a tear in my beer
Cause Im crying for you dear
You were on my lonely mind
