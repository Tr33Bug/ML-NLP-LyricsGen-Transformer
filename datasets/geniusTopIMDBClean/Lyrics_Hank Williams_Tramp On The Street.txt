Only a tramp was Lazarus sad fate
He who lay down at the rich mans gate
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
He was only a tramp found dead on the street
He was some mothers darlin he was some mothers son
Once he was fair and once he was young
And some mother rocked him her darlin to sleep
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street
Jesus he died on Calvarys tree
He shed his lifes blood for you and for me
They pierced his side and then his feet
And they left him to die like a tramp on the street
He was Marys own darlin he was gods chosen son
Once he was fair and once he was young
Mary she rocked him her darlin to sleep
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street
If Jesus should come and knock on your door
For a place to come in or bread from your store
Would you welcome him in or turn him away
Then the gods would deny you on the great judgment day
