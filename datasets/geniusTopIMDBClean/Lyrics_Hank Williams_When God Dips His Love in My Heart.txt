When God dips His pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul the message He wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine
When God dips His love in my heart
I said I wouldnt tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation when He made me whole
But I found I couldnt hide
Such love as Jesus did impart
It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart
He walked every step up Calvarys ragged way
And He gave His life completely to bring a better day
My life was lost in sinned but in love He took me in
His blood washed all my sins away
I said I wouldnt tell it to a living soul
How He brought salvation when He made me whole
But I found I couldnt hide
Such love as Jesus did impart
It makes me laugh and it makes me cry
Sets my sinful soul on fire
When God dips His love in my heart
