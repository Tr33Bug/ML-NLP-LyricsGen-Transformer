Why Dont You Love Me  Like You Used to Do  Lyrics
Well why dont you love me like you used to do
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why dont you love me like you used to do
Aint had no lovin like a huggin and a kissin
In a long long while
We dont get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile
Why dont you spark me like you used to do
And say sweet nothins like you used to coo
Im the same old trouble that youve always been through
So why dont you love me like you used to do
Well why dont you be just like you used to be
How come you find so many faults with me
Somebodys changed so let me give you a clue
Why dont you love me like you used to do
Aint had no lovin like a huggin and a kissin
In a long long while
We dont get nearer or further or closer
Than a country mile
Why dont you say the things you used to say
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay
My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue
Why dont you love me like you used to do
