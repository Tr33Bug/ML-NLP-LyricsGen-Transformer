The news is out all over town
That youve been seen arunnin round
I know that I should leave but then
I just cant go you win again
This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do You win again
Im sorry for your victim now
Cause soon his head like mine will bow
Hell give his heart but all in vain
And someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame
You take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain
I love you still you win again
