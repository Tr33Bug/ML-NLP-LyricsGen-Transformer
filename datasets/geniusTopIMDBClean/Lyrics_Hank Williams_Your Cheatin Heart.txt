Your cheatin heart will make you weep
Youll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep wont come the whole night through
Your cheatin heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
Youll toss around and call my name
Youll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin heart will tell on you
Your cheatin heart will pine someday
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when youll be blue
Your cheatin heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain
Youll toss around and call my name
Youll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin heart will tell on you
