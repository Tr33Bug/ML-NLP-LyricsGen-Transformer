If youre feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go  Go 
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if youre looking for a good time
And youre prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybodys got their vice
If youre waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
You might even get in free
So any time youre down the East End
Dont you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
Shell teach you more than you can know
Charlotte cant you get out from all this madness
Cant you see it only brings you sadness
When you entertain your men dont you know the risk of getting disease
Some day when youve reached the age of forty
I bet youll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You wont have any more beautiful wares to show anymore
22 the Avenue
Thats the place where we all go
You will find its warm inside
The red lights burning bright tonight
Charlotte isnt it time you stopped this mad life
Dont you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay
Sometimes when youre strolling down the Avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When youre walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
22 the Avenue
Thats the place where we all go
You will find its warm inside
The red lights burning bright tonight
Beat her mistreat her do anything that you please
Bite her excite her make her get down on her knees
Abuse her misuse her she can take all that youve got
Caress her molest her she always does what you want
Youre running away dont you know what youre doing
Cant you see itll lead you to ruin
Charlotte youve taken your life and youve thrown it away
You believe that because what youre earning
Your lifes good dont you know that its hurting
All the people that love you dont cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
Its no life for you stop all that screwing
Youre packing your bags youre coming with me
