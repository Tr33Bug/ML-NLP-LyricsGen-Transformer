There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble weve got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
Theres no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before its too late
Running scrambling flying
Rolling turning diving going in again
Running scrambling flying
Rolling turning diving
Run live to fly
Fly to live do or die
Wont you run live to fly
Fly to live aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 oclock move in behind us
Ten ME109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns
Rolling turning diving
Rolling turning diving doing it again
Rolling turning diving
Rolling turning diving


Run live to fly
Fly to live do or die
Wont you run live to fly
Fly to live aces high
