Lying awake at night
I wipe the sweat from my brow
But its not the fear
Cause Id rather go now
Trying to visualize
The horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground
When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime
When it comes to the time
Well be ready to die
God let us go now
And finish whats to be done
Thy Kingdom come
Thy shall be done on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves
The reasons to go
Should we live and let live
Forget or forgive
But how can we let them go on this way
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down
Theres no other way
No trust no reasoning no more to say
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid afraid to shoot strangers


Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
