If youre taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think youd expect you would see
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopen again
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see do you think we have learned
Not if youre taking a look at the wartorn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
There are times when I feel Im afraid for the world
There are times Im ashamed of us all
When youre floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is
Can you really tell me what life is
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fates own hand
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
When you think that weve used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When were living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
Were blood brothers were blood brothers
And if youre taking a walk through the garden of life
