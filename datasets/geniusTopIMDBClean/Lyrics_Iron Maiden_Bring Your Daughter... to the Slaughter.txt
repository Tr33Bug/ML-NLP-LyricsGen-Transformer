Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter Lyrics
Honey its getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound
If theres some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
Youd better know that Im the one
Unchain your back door
Invite me around
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
Let her go yeah
Honey its getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that Ill be waiting
Cause you know you know Im coming soon
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
So pick up your foolish pride
No going back
Nowhere no way no place to hide
Let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
To the slaughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go let her go let her go
Gonna getcha
