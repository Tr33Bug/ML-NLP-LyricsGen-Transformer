Can I play with madness
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if Im free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Dont need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
Can I play with madness
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness
Theres no vision there at all
Can I play with madness
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me ha he said
Can I play with madness
He said Youre blind too blind to see
Oh said Youre too blind to see mmm
I screamed aloud to the old man
I said Dont lie dont say you dont know
I say Youll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hellfires raged in his eyes
He said You wanna know the truth son
Lord Ill tell you the truth
Your souls gonna burn in a lake of fire
Can I play with madness
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness
Theres no vision there at all
Can I play with madness
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me haha he said
Can I play with madness
He said Youre blind too blind to see


Oh Listen to me said the prophet
Can I play with madness
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness
Theres no vision there at all
Can I play with madness
The prophet looked and he laughed at me ha he said
Can I play with madness
He said Youre blind too blind to see
Can I play with madness
