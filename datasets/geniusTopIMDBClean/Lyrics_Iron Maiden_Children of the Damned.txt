Hes walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Hes walking like a dead man
If he had lived he wouldve crucified us all
Now hes standing on his last step
He thought Oblivion Well it beckons us all
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Children of the damned
Now its burning his hands hes turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
Hes dust on the ground what did we learn
Oh ohohohohoh
Oh ohohohohoh
Oh ohohohohoh
Oh ohohohohoh
Oh ohohohohoh
Oh ohohohohoh
Oh ohohohohoh
Oh ohohohohoh


Youre children of the damned
Your backs against the wall
You turn into the light
Youre burning in the night
Youre children of the damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
Youll burn again tonight
Children of the damned
