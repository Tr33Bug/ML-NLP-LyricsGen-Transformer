The road it winds uphill all the way
Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
In God we trust cry it out loud
Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead
The burden of blood the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake
Lord above my spirit says
Death is not proud no more no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory
Wither a pain thats almost a joy
Wander there my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Stranger no wonder memories remain
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger one
Sent to do reckoning what must be done
Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty freedom maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause done faithfully


Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay
Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now embrace it my friend
Spirits cry for a god from the grave
In darkness fortune favours the brave
Dying a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal for he will live evermore
Dying a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal for he will live evermore
Think I am that Im almost there
Following now the depths of despair
Beyond the light darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all
Falling now where God cant explain
Bidding farewell a lifeline again
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the Celts
