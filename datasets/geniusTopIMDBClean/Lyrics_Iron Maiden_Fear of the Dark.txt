I am a man who walks alone
And when Im walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when its dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When youre searching for the light
Sometimes when youre scared
To take a look at the corner of the room
Youve sensed that somethings watching you
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and noones there
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because youre sure theres someone there
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there


Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have constant fear
That somethings always near
Fear of the dark fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someones always there
When Im walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone
