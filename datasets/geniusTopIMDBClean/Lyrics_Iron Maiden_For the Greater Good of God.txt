Are you a man of peace or a man of holy war
Too many sides to you dont know which anymore
So many full of life but also filled with pain
Dont know just how many will live to breathe again
A life thats made to breathe destruction or defense
A mind thats vain corruption bad or good intent
A wolf in sheeps clothing or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe a holy war winner
They fire off many shots and many parting blows
Their actions beyond the reasoning only God would know
And as He lies in Heaven or it could be in Hell
I feel hes somewhere here or looking from below
But I dont know I dont know
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is
More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine death and war
You know religion has a lot to answer for
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is


And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find its ashes that are scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere another war begins
And all because of it youd think that we would learn
But still the body count the city fires burn
Somewhere theres someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile the world is crying stupidity of man
Tell me why tell me why
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well tell me now what war is
Again tell me what life is
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
He gave his life for us he fell upon the cross
To die for all of those who never mourn his loss
It wasnt meant for us to feel the pain again
Tell me why
Tell me why
