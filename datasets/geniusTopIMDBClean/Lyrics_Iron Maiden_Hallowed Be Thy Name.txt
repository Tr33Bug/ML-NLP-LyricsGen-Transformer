Im waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesnt have much time
Cos at five oclock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
Take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that theres some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream
Somebody please tell me that Im dreaming
Its not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall but why am I crying
After all Im not afraid of dying
Dont I believe that there never is an end
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell God be with you
If theres a God why has He let me go
As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near Im not sorry
Catch my soul its willing to fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Dont worry now that I have gone
Ive gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then youll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah yeah yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah yeah yeah
Hallowed be thy name
Yeah
