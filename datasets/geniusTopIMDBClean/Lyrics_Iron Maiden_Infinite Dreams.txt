Infinite dreams I cant deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldnt hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing I cannot move
Standing rigid a nightmares statue
What a dream when will it end and will I transcend
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil
One nightmare ends another fertile
Its getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now in too deep
Even though its reached new heights
Id rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder makes me think
Theres more to this Im on the brink
Its not the fear of whats beyond
Its just that I might not respond
I have an interest almost craving
But would I like to get too far in
Cant be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me youre an unbeliever
Spiritualist
Well me Im neither
Wouldnt you like to know the truth
Of whats out there to have the proof
And find out just which side youre on
Where would you end
In Heaven or in Hell
Argh Oh
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams ow


Theres got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
Id like to think that when I die
Id get a chance another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate play the game
Again and again and again and again
