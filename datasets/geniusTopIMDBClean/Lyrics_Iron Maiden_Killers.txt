Oh yeah Yeah
Ow Yeah
Oh yeah
Ow Yeah
Ooh look out
You walk through the subway his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy he laughs as hes watching you bleed
Killer behind you his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one Im bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me ahahahahaha
I can see what a lifes meant to be
And youll never know how I came to forsee see see ahahaha
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow remember to walk in the light
I have found you and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me oh God help me what have I done
Ohh yeah Ive done it again
You walk through the subway my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy he laughs as hes watching you bleed
Killer behind you my blood lust defies all my needs
Ooh look out Im coming for you
Hahahahahahaha
Ooh
