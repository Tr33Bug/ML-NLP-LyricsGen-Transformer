Ohwoah yeah
Ive been looking so long for you now
You wont get away from my grasp
Youve been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know and I know that you aint got that long to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
Youre standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now I know that youre gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know Im helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Ooh
Keep your distance walk away dont take his bait
Dont you stray dont fade away yeah
Watch your step hes out to get you come what may
Dont you stray from the narrow way yeah
Im running and hiding in my dreams youre always there
Youre the Phantom of the Opera
Youre the devil youre just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air
You haunt me you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
