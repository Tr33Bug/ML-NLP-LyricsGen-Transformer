Into the Abyss Ill fall the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night watching me go
Green is the cats eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I dont wanna die Im a god
Why cant I live on
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
Im a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I dont wanna die Im a god
Why cant I live on
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
Im a Slave to the Power of Death
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man god preserved 
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
Ill strike from the grave


Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I dont wanna die Im a god
Why cant I live on
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
Im a Slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
