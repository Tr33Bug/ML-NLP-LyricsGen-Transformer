Walking through the city
Looking ohso pretty
Ive just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
Ive just got to find my way
Well you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing girl
Cant you believe that feeling cant you believe it
Cant you believe your eyes
Its the real thing girl
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothings with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Walking through the city
Looking ohso pretty
Ive just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
Ive just got to find my way
Well you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing girl
Cant you believe that feeling cant you believe it
Cant you believe your eyes
Its the real thing girl


Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
