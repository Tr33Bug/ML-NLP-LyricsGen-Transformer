Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the Oh
Tears for remembrance and tears for joy
Tears for somebody but this lonely boy
Out in the madness the all seeing eye
Flickers above us to light up the sky
Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterdays sorrows tomorrows white lies
Scan the horizon the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the  fire
