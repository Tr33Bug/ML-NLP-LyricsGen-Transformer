Hear the rime of the ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
And the music plays on as the bride passes by
Caught by a spell and the Mariner tells his tale
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobodys been
Through the snow fog flies on the Albatross
Hailed in Gods name hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the Albatross follows on
The Mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what hes done
But when the fog clears they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north til all is calm
The Albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck the dead bird is hung
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
Day after day day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water water everywhere nor any drop to drink


There calls the Mariner There comes a ship oer the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide
See onward she comes
Onward she nears out of the sun
See she has no crew
She has no life wait but theres two
Death and she LifeinDeath
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now
Then crew one by one
They drop down dead two hundred men
She she LifeinDeath
She lets him live her chosen one
One after one by the stardogged Moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
And I heard nor sigh nor groan
With heavy thump a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one
The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished hed die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on so did he
And by the light of the Moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
Gods creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The Albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain Hahahaha
Hear the groans of the longdead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and theyre lifeless in their eyes
And revenge still is sought penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the longdead bodies
Form their own light and the Mariners left alone
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilots boat his son and the Hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins
The Mariners bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach Gods word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made
And the Wedding guests a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on
