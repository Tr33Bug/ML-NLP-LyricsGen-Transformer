Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race
That is part of a clan
And to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean
When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free
Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
Its a time when you die
And without asking why
Cant you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans
Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Its a time wrought with fear
Its a land wrought with change
If our ancestors could hear
What is happening now
They would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has been written in chains


And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then Ill take what is mine
I am the clansman
And I swear to defend
And well fight to the end
And I swear that Ill never
Be taken alive
And I know that well stand
And well fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born free
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then Ill take what I want
I am the clansman
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
No no we cant let them take anymore
No we cant let them take anymore
Were the land of the free
No no we cant let them take anymore
No we cant let them take anymore
Were the land of the free
No no we cant let them take anymore
No we cant let them take anymore
No we cant let them take anymore
Were the land of the free
Oh ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh
Oh ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh
Oh ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh
Ohohohoh
