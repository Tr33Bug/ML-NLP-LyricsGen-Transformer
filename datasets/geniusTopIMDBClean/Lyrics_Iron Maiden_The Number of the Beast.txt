Woe to you oer Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixtysix
I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy
Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me
Cos in my dreams its always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah
Night was black was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun Satans work is done
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This cant go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize cant avoid the eyes
Sixsixsix the number of the beast
Sixsixsix the one for you and me
Im coming back I will return
And Ill possess your body and Ill make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course
