When the moon will rise again
Until we read the Parthian skin
Broken fears warning days are here again
Fore we all to dust descend
Heaven knows when life will end
God to know in the mire put out the fire
Know there is a cross to bear
In your primal quest of fear
No quarter now is given no less
Aslumber was my main ideal
Asunder did my spirit steal
Sceptred race uttered words in disgrace
Sweet revenge will be ours
Vengeance of a shaken world
Just remember that patience is no sin
And to find another way
Live to breathe another day
Lord of light in the darkness our guide
In a tempest never shaken
Edge of doom is not mistaken
Countenance is not a sin
Gallant king we bow to him
Fierce as wolf with a leopard skin
Dark and bitter deep within
Invader punished with his life
Vanquished in the morning
Sea of blood in light divine
Unholy reverence enjoyed
Intoxicated with their hell
Man immortal sickness dwell
Savage beasts troops engage
Assembled here to butcher blades
Smoke has darkened in the air
Smell of death and deep despair
Wilderness a tyrant dream
Sell your soul not give them power
Slay upon imperial crown
Witness now the witching hour
Bound himself to oath and king
Such loyalty a shameless thing
Youth of agony still burn
Shedding parents blood
Never say a prayer to me
For this crime and treachery
Drinking from your cup of wisdom true
Many men will follow you
Now an army is raised
And our gods they be praised
Death is but a guilted edge
Shall no more than we will pledge
Hear the cry we are ready to believe
The prodigal has returned
Give us our own revenge
With the power he learned
We will burn the same again
A betrayal of angels in a foreign land
A revenge for the merciful destiny at hand
For all those who have written
In the sand will be told
That the same will happen searching for gold
Like a fire in the sky
I can feel strength return
Heading for afterlife meet me there
