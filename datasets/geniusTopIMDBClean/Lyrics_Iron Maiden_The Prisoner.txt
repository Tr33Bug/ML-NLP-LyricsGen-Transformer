The new number two
Who is number one
You are number six
I am not a number I am a free man

And Im starving now feelin dead on my feet
Goin all the way Im natures beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run fight to breathe its tough

Break the walls Im comin out
Not a prisoner Im a free man
And my blood is my own now
Dont care where the past was
I know where Im going out
If you kill me its selfdefense
But if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye I will defy
Youll be afraid when I call out your name

Live my life where I want to
Youd better scratch me from your black book
Cos Ill run rings around you
