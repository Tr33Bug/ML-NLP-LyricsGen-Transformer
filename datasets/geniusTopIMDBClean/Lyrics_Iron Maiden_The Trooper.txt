Youll take my life but Ill take yours too
Youll fire your musket but Ill run you through
So when youre waiting for the next attack
Youd better stand theres no turning back
The bugle sounds the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We wont live to fight another day
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My bodys numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
