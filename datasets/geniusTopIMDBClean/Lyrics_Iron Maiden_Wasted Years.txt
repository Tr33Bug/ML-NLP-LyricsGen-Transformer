From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
Im travellin on far and wide
But now it seems
Im just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isnt me but someone else
I close my eyes and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Aint it funny how it is
You never miss it til its gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be til my dying day
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realize youre living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Cant ease this pain so easily
When you cant find the words to say
Its hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realize youre living in the golden years
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realize youre living in the golden years
So understand
Dont waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up make your stand
And realize youre living in the golden years
