Its snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
Theyre closing in the fortress is near
Its standing high in the sky
The cable cars the only way in
Its really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
Theyve got to try to save the day
The panicking cries the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare
