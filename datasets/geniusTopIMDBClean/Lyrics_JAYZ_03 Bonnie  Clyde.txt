Uhh uhh uhh
You ready B
Lets go get em
Look for me
Young B cruisin down the Westside Highway
Doin what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
Im mashin the gas shes grabbin the wheel its trippy
How hard she rides with me the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we dont speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the shows over
Shes right back to being my soldier
Cause mamis a rider and Im a roller
Put us together how they gon stop both us
Whatever she lacks Im right over her shoulder
When Im off track mami is keepin me focused
So lets lock this down like its supposed to be
The 03 Bonnie and Clyde Hov and B holla
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend  me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend  me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend  me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend  me and my boyfriend 
The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
That aint bout nothin
If ever you mad about somethin
It wont be that oh no it wont be that
I dont be at places where we comfy at
With no beatch oh no you wont see that
And no I aint perfect
Nobody walkin this earths surface is
But girlfriend work with the kid
I keep you workin that Herms Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs Aviator lens
Six hundred drops hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I dont have to worry only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So dont let the necessary occur yep


All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend  me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend  me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend  me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend  me and my boyfriend 
Talk to em B  If I was your girlfriend
Ill be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me  Thats right 
Yeahhee  Break it down for em B 
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise Ill give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend  One more time 
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in all that I believe in
I promise Ill give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend  me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend  me and my boyfriend 
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend  me and my girlfriend 
Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend  me and my boyfriend
