Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
Im letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away
Look I apologize often womanize
Took for my child to be born see through a womans eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song I dont deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
Please pick up the phone pick up the phone
I said Dont embarrass me instead of Be mine
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me I wasnt ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
Cause I wasnt present your body wouldnt accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say Im all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Oh
I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay til our backs burn
Were supposed to laugh til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didnt know
I promised I cried I couldnt hold
I suck at love I think I need a doover
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over What if
You over my shit
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Oh
And if my children knew
I dont even know what I would do
If they aint look at me the same
I would probly die with all the shame
You did what with who
What good is a mnage  trois when you have a soulmate
You risked that for Blue
If I wasnt a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blues tooth the tooth fairy didnt pay
Im never gonna treat you like I should
