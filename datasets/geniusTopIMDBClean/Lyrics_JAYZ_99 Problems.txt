If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Ive got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my caskets closed
Rap critics that say hes Money Cash Hoes
Im from the hood stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
Youd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
Im like Fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I dont play they show
They dont play my hits well I dont give a shit so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads
Fuckers I dont know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
Im from rags to riches niggas I aint dumb
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
The year is 94 in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
Got two choices yall pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor
And I aint tryin to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard Son do you know why Im stopping you for
Cause Im young and Im black and my hats real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir I dont know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more
Well you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are
I aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that
Arent you sharp as a tack
You some type of lawyer or something
Somebody important or something
Well I aint passed the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you wont illegally search my shit
Well well see how smart you are when the K9 come
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin a pussy
But a pussy havin no goddamn sense try and push me
I try to ignore him talk to the Lord
Pray for him but some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motorbike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing thats gon happen is Ima get to clappin
And he and his boys gonna be yappin to the Captain
And there I go trapped in the KitKat again
Back through the system with the riffraff again
Fiends on the floor scratchin again
Paparazzis with they cameras snappin em
DA try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil for bail cause Im African
All because this fool was harassin them
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccharine
But aint nothin sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems bein a bitch aint one  hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If youre havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one  hit me
You crazy for this one Rick
Its your boy
