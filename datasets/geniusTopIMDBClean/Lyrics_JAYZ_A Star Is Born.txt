To this corner office its so enormous
Hey
Prez Carter watching her get her Monica on all day

And could I be a star
Does fame in this game have to change who you are
Or could I be the same one who came from a faraway life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights
Now Im shining in the broad daylightgo figure
A slow transition from a lil broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now cop a lil ice later
Cole you got the glow like a lil lightsaber
So clap for him
Then applaud Hov he gave him a platform
Flow so sick thought he wrote the rap for himno sir
The flow cold as the shoulders of golddigging hoes when a broke nigga proaches
Told you Im focused man
Ill let you motherfuckers soak it in and clap for em
Every day a star is born  And you say New York City 
Yeah hey and clap for em
