TranslationsFranaisBeach Is Better  Interlude  Lyrics
Hit ya ass on the celly cause I aint got time
To be arguing with your ass if you aint really ready
Girl why you never ready For as long as you took
You better look like Halle Berry Or Beyonc
Shit then we getting married
I brought sand to the beach cause my beach is better
You can keep ya beach cause that beach whatever
Started out at The Darby ended up at 1 Oak
Left the house with 100 grand ended up near broke
Dont get mad at me Im buying bucket after bucket
When its gone Im like Fuck it
I replace it with another one
Cant take this money with you
Burn this shit up like Im Richard
Niggas asking Is the oven on
