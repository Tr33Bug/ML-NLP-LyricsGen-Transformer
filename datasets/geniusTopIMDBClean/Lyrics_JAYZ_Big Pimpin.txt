Comin straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my scenahrio
Oops my bad thats my scenario
No I cant fuck a scary ho
Now every time every place everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin they say There he go
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo
Heat than a little bit
We dont pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it wont be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch
And step up your vocab
Dont be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin down on yo SLAB
Livin ghettofabulous so mad you just cant take it
But nigga if you hatin I
Then you wait while I get your bitch buttnaked
Just break it you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo ass to the back as Im flyin to the track
Timbaland let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the prozone
Thats the track that we breakin these hoes on
Aint the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Triggerman

Dont trip lets flip gettin throwed on the flip
Gettin blowed with the motherfuckin Jigga Man fool

Made my money quick then back to the streets
But still sittin on blades sippin that Ray
Standin on the corner of my block hustlin
Still gettin that caine
Half what I paid slippin right through customs
Itll sell by night its egg shell white
