Yeah hah yeah RocAFella
We invite you to somethin epic you know
Well we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin
But we feel we have nothin to lose
So we offer you well we offer our lives right
What do you bring to the table
While Im watchin every nigga watchin me closely
My shit is butter for the bread they wanna toast me
I keep my head both of them where they supposed to be
Hoesll get you sidetracked then clapped from close feet
I dont sleep Im tired I feel wired like codeine these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain wish it was quick to see
From sellin caine til brains was fried to a fricassee
Cant lie at the time it never bothered me
At the bar gettin my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin hard happy to be escapin poverty however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips for precipitation we stack chips hardly
The youth I used to be soon to see a millin
No more Big Willie my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin for revenues Rayful Edmondlike
Channel 7 News round seven jewels head dead in the mic
Forgettin all I ever knew convenient amnesia
I suggest you call my lawyer I know the procedure
Lock my body cant trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
Id rather die enormous than live dormant thats how we on it
Live at the main event I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin in codes since I sense you peekin
The NSX rental dont be fooled my game is mental
We both out of town dog what you tryin to get into
Viva Las Vegas see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin they reup
And we can have a pleasant time sippin margaritas
Gegegeyeahhh
Can I live
Can I live
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus if driven wrong its sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it manifest it
In tangible goods platinum Rolexd it
We dont lease we buy the whole car as you should
My confederation dead a nation
Explode on detonation overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam it comes to it
We all fiends gotta do it even righteous minds go through this
True this the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin cream
Lets do this it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS  you see me stressed right
Can I live
Can I live
Can I live
Can I live
