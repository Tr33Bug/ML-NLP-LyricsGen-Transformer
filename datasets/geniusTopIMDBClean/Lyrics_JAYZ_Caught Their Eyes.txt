Ready for it
Im ready for it
Yeah ah
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa uh
Talkin about that Lisa nigga with that Westside nigga
With that Eastside that dance uh
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes dont fly
Bruh I survived readin guys like you
Im surprised yall think you can disguise yall truths
I seen eyes wide as theyre about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters dont give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act bruh
Yall body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I
My crash course was much tougher
Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends mothers
And show up at the funeral complete with blank stares
Invisible ink I had to read things that wasnt there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a sideeye in my sleep
Ready for it deep breath fill up the void
Eyes open them up check off the coins
Still stingin from tears they try to see you
Im ready for earth ready for real
Solipsistic admit it I see you there
So it seems so you seem  Uhhuh yeah 
I cant tell if youre image or are just the flare  Yeah 
In my dreams in my dreams  Ugh 
I sat down with Prince eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now Londell McMillan he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas they always been fishy
But aint no Biggie no lazy eye huh
This guy has Slave on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
Im surprised you aint auction off the casket
Dont big bro me dont Big Homie
Ive seen pure admiration become rivals
Ive been to Paris at least two times
Ive seen the Eiffel Ive seen a eyeful
Ready for it deep breath fill up the void
Eyes open them up check off the coins
Still stingin from tears they try to see you
Im ready for earth ready for real
Solipsistic admit it I see you there
So it seems so you seem
I cant tell if youre image or are just the flare
In my dreams in my dreams
Ive been out of touch for a couple years
Ive been ready for this for real
Hopin I can touch what I see
Cause Ive been ready for you for real
Look youve done enough
Have you no sense of decency sir
At long last have you left no sense of decency
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa uh
Talkin about that Lisa nigga with that Westside nigga
With that Eastside uh
