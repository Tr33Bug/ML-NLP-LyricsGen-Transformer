TranslationsFranais
They cant keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin for a search
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs
You in the presence of a king
Scratch that you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras you over baby
Robinson Cano you coming with me
These niggas like rotary phones
Its a new day hit up KD
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said Ill never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldnt let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
bout 6 minutes you gonna see it again
bout 6 minutes you gonna see me again
Shit on me these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead they tried to wipe me out of they history
If Fear is your only God
Get yall to fear me is my only job
Crown crown
Crown crown
Bulletproof glass glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love niggas down since the yolk
Bitch asked if I was God fuck Im supposed to say No
You already seen me turn a man to a GOAT
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water made it disappear
I made it reappear I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost bottom grill I make my tooth get gold
All the shit I did I wasnt supposed to live Hallelujah Hov
Wasnt for the caine wouldnt be able
Wasnt for the bread probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies niggas knives are doubleedged


Shit on me these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead they tried to wipe me out of they history
