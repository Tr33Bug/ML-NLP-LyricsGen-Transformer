Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Secret society tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
I cant die I cant die I cant die
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak were all tryna win
But then again maybe its for the best though
Cause when theyre sayin too much
You know theyre tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldnt understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld granted
Ninetofive is how you survive I aint tryna survive
Im tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God I prayed to Gotti
Thats right its wicked  thats life I live it
Aint askin for forgiveness for my sins ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin their brains for angles on all the evils that the gamell do
It gets dangerous money and power is changin us
And now were lethal infected with Devils
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Secret society tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
I cant die I cant die I cant die
We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew blackhearted
Thinkin back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned so in turn Im kidnappin his babys mother
My hand around her collar feedin her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasnt convinced
I kept feedin her money til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now Im tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know shes wishin we were still close
Dont cry it is to be in time
Ill take away your miseries and make it mine Devils
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Secret society tryna keep they eye on me
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
Illuminati want my mind soul and my body
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
I cant die I cant die I cant die
My flesh no nigga could test my soul is possessed
By Devils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin sticks
Like Homie you dont know me
But the whole world owe me strip
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin life
So now Im down for whatever aint nothin nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquors invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off  Momma forgive me
I cant be held accountable Devils beatin me down boo
Got me runnin with guys makin Gs tellin lies that sound true
Come test me I never cower
For the love of money son Im givin lead showers
Stop screamin you know the demon said its best to die
And even if Jehovah witness bet hell never testify Devils
Dear God  I wonder can you save me
I cant die I cant die I cant die
