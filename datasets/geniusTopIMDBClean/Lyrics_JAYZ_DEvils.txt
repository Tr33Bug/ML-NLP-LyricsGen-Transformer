D’Evils Lyrics

"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're sayin' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"

We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin'
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be; in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"
My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin' sticks
Like, "Homie, you don't know me
But the whole world owe me, strip!"
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo
Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers
Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils

"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"56Embed
