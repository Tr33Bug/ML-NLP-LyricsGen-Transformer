Rock on RocAFella yall
The saga continues  What the fuck 
Ahh who wanna bet us that we dont touch lettuce
Stack cheddars forever live treacherous all the et ceteras
To the death of us me and my confidants we shine
You feel the ambiance yall niggas just rhyme
By the ounce dough accumulates like snow
We dont just shine we illuminate the whole show you feel me
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street let alone the heat
Fuck em they hate a nigga lovin his life
In all possible ways know the Feds is buggin my life
Hospital days reflectin when my man laid up
On the uptown hot block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin this is a minor setback
Yo still in all we livin just dream about the getback
That made him smile though his eyes said pray for me
Ill do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest its a slow process

The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential ice thatll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin brilliant
Ill tell you half the story the rest you fill it in
Long as the villain win
