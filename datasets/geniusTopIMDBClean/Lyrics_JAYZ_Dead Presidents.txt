Rock on RocAFella yall
While others spit that Wonderama shit me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream you know exactly what this shits about
Fuck yall mean Handlin since a teen I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team without doubt
My life aint rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine till the dough hit it and told me that the Mo did it
And now its kosher shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches
Watch how Im walkin cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARCin
Tryin to strike a bargain hopin that they might get pardoned
Shit Im involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil thoughts that this sportll feed you
Peep facts in the game so deep fiends could catch a
Freeze off my kneecap can yall believe that
Got the city drinkin Cristals reup the fee
Rappers goin broke tryin to keep up with me
My rise to riches surprised the bitches think harder
You know this nigga JAYZ Shawn Carter
GS the fuck up dreeess the fuck up
Watch me shine like a Breitling Breguets the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Alzheimers
Small timers I said it Im addressin all drama
Talk to me

So sick of niggas
I want money like Cosby  who wouldnt
This the kinda talk that make me think you probably aint got no puddin
Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail
You in the streets nigga make your moves get your mail
Niggasll coast in the SL but cant post bail
Niggasll roast a L but scared to throw your toast well
Im here to tell niggas it aint all swell
Theres heaven then theres hell niggas
One day youre cruisin in your 7 next day youre sweatin forgettin your lies
Alibis aint matchin up bullshit catchin up
Hit with the RICO they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
Bout to start bitchin aint you Ready to start snitchin aint you
Ill forgive your weakass hustlin just aint you
Aside from the fast cars honies that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldnt be involved
With the underworld dealers carriers of MACmillers
East Coast bodiers West Coast cappeelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped in the station filled up on octane and now they not sane
And not playin that goes without sayin
Slayin day in and day out when money play in then they play you out
Tryin to escape my own mind lurkin the enemy
Representin infinity with presidencies you know
Dead fuckin presidents to represent me  Whose
