Thank you thank you thank you
Youre far too kind
Now can I get a encore Do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need yall to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me there shall be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
Who you know fresher than Hov Riddle me that
The rest of yall know where Im lyrically at
Cant none of yall mirror me back
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G Rap in his prime
Im Young HO raps Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe now break bread
Im in Boeing jets Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young what the fuck you expect Yep yep
Grand openin grand closin
Goddamn your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon find doper than him
With no pen just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you cant replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations
Now can I get an encore Do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need yall to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin for
Sighs  Look what you made me do Look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues how will they pay you
When you first come in the game they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years  yeah 
As fate would have it Jays status appears
To be at an alltime high perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin the 45 it aint to play games with you
Its to aim at you probably maim you
If I owe you Im blowin you to smithereens
Cocksucker take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing  one thing 
I came I saw I conquered
From record sales to soldout concerts
So motherfucker if you want this encore
I need you to scream til your lungs get sore


Owww its star time
This man is mean hes killin all yall jive turkeys
Do yall want more of the Jigga man
Well if yall want more of the Jigga man
Then I need yall to help me bring him back to stage
Say Hova  cmon say it
Are yall out there 
Cmon louder
Yeah now see thats what Im talking about
They love you Jigga They love you Jigga
I like the way this one feel
Its so motherfuckin soulful man
Whoaaaaaahhhh whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh 
Yeah  okay
So this here is the victory lap
Then Im leavin thats how you get me back
After a year of them 16s its 12
And thats 24 and Im only doin two
You wanted to gain attention new dudes
I can get you BET  and TRL too
You want to be in the public send your budget
Well fuck it I aint budgin
Young did it to death you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldnt cut it
Now look at me all starstudded
Golfer above par like I putted
All cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this
You want to bang send Kanye change
Send Just some dust send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin like this
What the hell are you waiting for
