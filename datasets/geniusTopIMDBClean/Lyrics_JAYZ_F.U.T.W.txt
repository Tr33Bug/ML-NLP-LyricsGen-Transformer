TranslationsFranaisFUTW Lyrics
Just let me be great
Let me be great
I feel like mothafuckin Cassius Clay right now
Genius
Dont be good my nigga be great
After that government cheese we eating steak
After the projects now we on estates
Im from the bottom I know you can relate
Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream Hov got a team
My chain already heavy dont let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush confetti on my fur
Turn right in Rutland niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
Im just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1 of a billion more than niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like its an everyday thing clean
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the uhh
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the lowlow
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murdered Malcolm gave Cassius the shakes
Wait tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know Im gon shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy basking on top
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Lets fuck up the world
Fuck up the uhh
Sipping DUSS boy this aint your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac me Im in the Maybach
This aint grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got strip clubs feeling like Oxford I swear
Teacherteacher Im trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught yall they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere you in the HOVs
Jordan 1s and dungarees
And thats just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
til we all check a billion shit its just the way Im feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling we just top what we top
Cause the bars dont struggle when the struggle dont stop
Just fuck up this world
