The most amazing feeling I feel
Words cant describe the feeling for real
Baby I paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you you Glory
False alarms and false starts
All made better by the sound of your heart
All the pain of the last time
I prayed so hard it was the last time
Your mama said that you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her
Glory Glory
Glory Sorry
Everything that I prayed for
Gods gift I wish I woulda prayed more
God makes no mistakes I made a few
Rough sledding here and there but I made it through
I wreak havoc on the world
Get ready for part two
A younger smarter faster me
So a pinch of Hov a whole glass of Bey
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words cant describe the feeling for real
Baby I paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you you Glory
Your Grandpop died of nigga failure
Then he died of liver failure
Deep down he was a good man
Goddamn I cant deliver failure
Badass lil Hov
Two years old shopping on Savile Row
Wickedass lil B
Hard not to spoil you rotten looking like little me
The most beautifulest thing in this world
Is daddys little girl
You dont yet know what swag is but you was made in Paris
And Mama woke up the next day and shot her album package
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic
We was afraid youd disappear but nah baby you magic  Voil 
So there you have it shit happens
Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carryon baggage
Everybody go through stuff
Life is a gift love open it up
Youre a child of destiny
Youre the child of my destiny
Youre my child with the child from Destinys Child
Thats a hell of a recipe
Glory Glory
Glory Sorry
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words cant describe the feeling for real
Baby I paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you you Glory
