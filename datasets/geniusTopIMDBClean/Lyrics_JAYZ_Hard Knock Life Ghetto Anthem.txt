Hard Knock Life  Ghetto Anthem  Lyrics
Take the bass line out
Uhhuh Jigga
Uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh yeah
Let it bump though
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated we get tricked
Instead of kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life
From standin on the corners boppin
To drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot with the smoke Glock
Fleein the murder scene you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell my only hell
But since when yall niggas know me to fail Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips bust shots
And if you with me mama rub on your tits and whatnot
Im from the school of the hard knocks you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Lets stick up the world and split it 5050 uhhuh
Lets take the dough and stay real jiggy uhhuh
And sip the Cris and get pissypissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie baby
You know its hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter nigga Volume 2
Yall niggas get ready
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated we get tricked
Instead of kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life
I flow for those droed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four controllin the house
We live in hard knocks
We dont take over we borrow blocks
Burn em down and you can have it back
Daddy Id rather that
I flow for chicks wishin they aint have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers thats born to clock
Know Ima be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines to green 5s
Ive seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze lifes ills
Then I put it down type Braille
Im tight grill with the phony
Rappers yall might feel we homies
Im like Still yall dont know me
Shit Im tight grill when my situation aint improvin
Im tryna murder everything movin  feel me
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated we get tricked
Instead of kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated we get tricked
Instead of kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life
I dont know how to sleep I gotta eat stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef so logically I prey on my foes
Hustlin is still inside of me and as far as progress
Youd be hardpressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint and yall lamed out
Didnt really appreciate it til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums nonstop for ya nigga
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated we get tricked
Instead of kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life
