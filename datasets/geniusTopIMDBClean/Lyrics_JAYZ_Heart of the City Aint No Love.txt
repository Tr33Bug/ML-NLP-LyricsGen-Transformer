Heart of the City  Aint No Love  Lyrics
First the Fat Boys break up now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov
Whats up Yall niggas all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
And my records movin out the store
Young fucks spittin at me young rappers gettin at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
Mo Money Mo Problems gotta move carefully
Cause faggots hate when you gettin money like athletes
Youngins icegrillin me oh you not feelin me
Fine it cost you nothin pay me no mind
Look Im on my grind cousin aint got time for frontin
Sensitive thugs yall all need hugs
Damn little mans Im just tryna do me
If the records two mil Im just tryna move three
Get a couple chicks get em to try to do E
Hopefully theyll mnage before I reach my garage
I dont want much fuck I drove every car
Some nice cooked food some nice clean drawers
Birdass niggas I dont mean to ruffle yall
I know you waitin in the wing but Im doin my thing
Wheres the love
Aint no love in the heart of the city
I said wheres the love
Aint no love in the heart of town  Yeah 
And then the Fugees gon break up now every day I wake up
Somebody got somethin to say
Whats all the fuckin fussin for
Because Im grubbin more
And I pack heat like Im the oven door
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now I dont wanna have to kill soundboys
Dont wanna have to cock back the fourpound bar
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
Im not lookin at you dudes Im lookin past ya
I thought I told you characters Im not a rapper
Can I live
I told you 96 that I came to take this shit and I did
Handle my biz I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham but the only thing runnin is numbers fam
Jigga held you down six summers damn wheres the love
Aint no love in the heart of the city
Niggas wheres the love
Aint no love in the heart of town  Holla at me 
Aint no love  Take em to church  in the heart of the city
Uh uh uh uh my nigga where is the love
Aint no love in the heart of town  Fuck 


Then Richard Pryor go and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records you never disrespected me
Now that Im successful youll pull this shit
Nigga Ill step on your porch step to your boss
Lets end the speculation Im talkin to all of yall
Males shouldnt be jealous thats a female trait
What you mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight
Yall dont know my expenses I gotta buy bigger plates
Haha and more baggies why you all aggy
Nigga respect the game that should be it
What you eat dont make me shit
Wheres the love
Wheres the love
Aint no love in the heart of the city
Aint no love in the heart of town
Aint no love in the heart of the city
Aint no love in the heart of town
Aint no love in the heart of the city
Aint no love in the heart of town
Aint no love
