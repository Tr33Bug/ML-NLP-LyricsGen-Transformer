Izzo  HOVA  Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen lets put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You couldve been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
I appreciate that
Uh
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed got rid of that dirt for them
Wasnt born hustlers I was birthing em
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Cant leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome it aint easy
Cops want to knock me DA wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty he who does not feel me
Is not real to me therefore he doesnt exist
So poof vamoose son of a bitch
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty yall got to feel me
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up  Holla at me 
I do this for my culture to let em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me Im raisin the status quo up
Im overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk but money talks so talk more bucks
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty yall got to feel me
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
Yeah Hov is back life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack  Yeah 
Like I told you sell drugs no Hov did that
So hopefully you wont have to go through that
I was raised in the projects roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin they mamas sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost why I got my hand closed
Cracks in my palm watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
Ive seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiends weight
To try and to fail the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game the two things thats great
H to the izzO V to the izzA
What else can I say about dude I gets busy
H to the izzO V to the izzA
For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Not guilty yall got to feel me
H to the izzO V to the izzA
Thats the anthem getcha damn hands up
H to the izzO V to the izzA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
H to the izzO V to the izzA
