I work and work til Im halfdead and I hear people saying
Shes getting old and what do I get A daughter
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her
As she cares about ME
Lets do this for these babies
Mercedes truck fuck houses on acres
Blatantly ballin on HD
Yall need to step up yall AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
Its barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please dont judge me only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didnt love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music aww isnt she lovely
Now Im staring at her praying that things dont get ugly
And Im stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me
High on life
I could die from the fall imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me sort of like daddy dearest
Dont fuck with me fellas This aint my first time at the rodeo
I dream filthy  My mom and pops 
Mixed me with Jamaican  Rum and whiskey what a set off 
And I know Im not perfect baby
I done been through so much trauma it gonna be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady open doors on the Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know if we aint speaking everyday I fucking hate it
I dont wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper all is missing is the drugs in me
High on life
I could die from the fall imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me sort of like daddy dearest


No wire hangers EVER
Father never taught me how to be a father treat a mother
I dont wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no momma drama
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror have to face my fears
Cheer up why cant you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldnt let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And Im trying and Im lying if I said I wasnt scared
But in life and death if I aint here
High on life
I could die from the fall imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me sort of like daddy dearest
