Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh  Its not a diss song its just a real song 
Uh uh  You feel me 
I heard motherfuckers sayin they made Hov
Made Hov say Okay so Make another Hov
Niggas wasnt playin they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and JLo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends business interests is Day Glow
Aint nothin left to say though I guess we forgot what we came fo
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin too much Sam Rothstein
I aint a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I aint even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I aint even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
Its stronger than heroin
When you could look in the mirror like There I am
And still not see what youve become
I know Im guilty of it too but not like them you lost one
Lose one let go to get one  One one one 
Get one lose some to win some  One one one one you lost one 
Story of a champion  One one one 
Sorry Im a champion you lost one  One one one one uh 
I dont think its meant to be B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly at twentythree
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So we aint we its me and her
Cause what she prefers over me is work
And thats where we differ
So I have to give her free time even if it hurts
So breathe mami its deserved
Youve been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me My time in the army its served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The times now for her in time shell mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally my times too short to share
And to ask her now it aint fair so yeah she lost one
Lose one let go to get one  One one one 
Get one lose some to win some
One one one oh yeah she lost one

Sorry Im a champion you lost one  One one one 
My nephew died in the car I bought
So under the belief its partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please not that Lord
But time dont go back it goes forward
Cant run from the pain go towards it
Some things cant be explained what caused it
Such a beautiful soul so pure shit
Gonna see you again Im sure of it
Til that time little man Im nauseous
Your girlfriends pregnant the Lords gift
Almost lost my faith that restored it
Its like havin your life restarted
Cant wait for your childs life to be a part of it
So now Im childlike waitin for a gift
To return when I lost you I lost it
Lose one let go to get one  One one one 
Get one lose some to win some
