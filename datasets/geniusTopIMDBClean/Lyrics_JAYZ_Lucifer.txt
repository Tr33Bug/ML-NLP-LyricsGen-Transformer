Kanyeezy you did it again you a genius nigga
Lucifer son of the morning Im gonna chase you out of Earth
Im from the murder capital where we murder for capital 
Lucifer son of the morning Im gonna chase you out of Earth
So you need to change your attitude fore they asking what happened to you 
Lord forgive him he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Themamurder me so I gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performing procedures
Jesus I aint trying to be facetious but
Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord you said it better than all
Leave niggas on deaths door breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping Brown Sugar by DAngelo
In Los Angeles like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe being good Catholics Im coming
Lucifer Lucifer son of the morning Im gonna chase you out of Earth
Im from the murder capital where we murder for capital 
Lucifer Lucifer son of the morning Im gonna chase you out of Earth
So you need to change your attitude fore they asking what happened to you 
Yes this is holy war I wet yall all with the holy water
Spray from the HecklerKoch automatic
All the static shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical I throw couple at you take six
Spread love to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis till I head above
Yessir and when I perish the meek shall inherit the Earth
til that time its on and popping church
Like Don Bishop the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebodys cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
Ill let you see where that bright light leads you
The more you talk the more you irking us
The more you gon need memorial services
The Black Album second verse is like
Devils pie save some dessert for us


Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They wont be happy til somebody die
Oh man I gotta get my soul right
Fore Im locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems its alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
Let me get serious for yall one second 
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bobs killer
Asking him why as my eyes fill up
These days I cant wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten homes I still feel ya
So curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are Bobalob
Lord forgive him we all have sinned
But Bobs a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning thanks again
