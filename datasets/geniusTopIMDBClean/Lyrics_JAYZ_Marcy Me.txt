Live from BedfordStuyvesant
The livest one representin BK to the fullest
Bastards duckin when Hov be buckin
Chickenheads be cluckin
Uhh back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen
And Jam Master Jay was alive II I was mixin
Cookin coke in the kitchen
Back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losin to Isiah but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet heres a verse from Hamlet
Lord we know who we are
Yet we know not what we may be
So maybe Im the one or maybe Im crazy
Im from Marcy Houses where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin
Yeah thats where it all started
When Denzel was blottin carpet Ill pack a nine millimeter
When Slick Rick made Mona Lisa
When Lisa Bonet was Beyonc of her day I had divas yall
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus Nah
Pregnant pause give you some second thoughts
Theres room on the bandwagon dont abort
Marcy me
Marcy me
Streets is my artery the vein of my existence
Im the Gotham City heartbeat
I started in lobbies now parley with Saudis
Ima Sufi to goofies I could prolly speak Farsi
Thats poetry reek of coca leaf in my past
Came through the bushes smellin like roses
I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn not this new shit shit feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe Im talkin bustin off the roof uh
Hold a Uzi vertical let the thing smoke
Yall flirtin with death I be winkin through the scope
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals
Plural fuck the Federal Bureau
Shout out to Nostrand Ave Flushing Ave Myrtle
All the County of Kings may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa Daddy Kane heroes
Thus concludin my concerto
Marcy me
Must be in the air
Oh cant walk away I know I know
Just the way Im raised
I know I know I know
Oh Marcy Marcy me
Just the way I am always gonna be
I aint gonna change no
Marcy Marcy me just the way I am
I aint gonna change no
I aint gonna change no
Couldnt change me if I wanted to
You couldnt change me if you wanted to
Ima take this with me to the Moon
Como hs nome cavaleiro
Eu hei nome Todo o Mundo
E meu tempo
