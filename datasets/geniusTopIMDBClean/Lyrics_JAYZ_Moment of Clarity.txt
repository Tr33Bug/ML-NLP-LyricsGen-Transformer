Woo Geah geah  Young  geah
Uhh turn the music up turn the lights down Im in my zone
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The worldll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Yall cant fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close youll hear what Im about
Nigga feel my truths
Pop died didnt cry didnt know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
With that in the eggshell standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church pretending to be hurt wouldnt work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like Damn that mans face is just like my face
So Pop I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasnt all your fault homie you got caught
Into the same game I fought  Ugh  that Uncle Ray lost  Ugh 
My big brothers and so many others I saw
Im just glad we got to see each other
Talk and remeet each other
Save a place in Heaven til the next time we meet forever
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The worldll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt

Nigga feel my truths


Music business hate me cause the industry aint make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumb down for my audience and double my dollars
They criticize me for it yet they all yell holla
If skills sold truth be told Id probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill  I aint been rhyming like Common since  Woo 
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception Go with what makes sense
Since I know what Im up against
We as rappers must decide whats most important
And I cant help the poor if Im one of them
So I got rich and gave back to me thats the winwin
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them  rims that is 
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The worldll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths

My homie Sig was on a tier where no tears should fall
Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
Til we all got triangles on our wall
Aint just rapping for the platinum yall record
I recall cause I really been there before  Woo 
Four scores and seven years ago prepared the flow
Prepared for war I should fear no man
You dont hear me though these words aint just paired to go
In one ear out the other ear no  No 
Yo my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me nigga Scarsll scab
What you gonna box me homie I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldnt touch me thank God for that
Im strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back  Sup Big 
And the whole BK nigga holla back
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The worldll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
