You see this motherfucking face 
Blessings blessings yeah I see
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin dont dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so well fuck it fuck it
Because this water drown my family this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean
