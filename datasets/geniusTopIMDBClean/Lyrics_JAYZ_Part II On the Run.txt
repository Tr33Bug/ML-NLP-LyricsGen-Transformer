TranslationsFranaisPart II  On the Run  Lyrics
Who wants that perfect love story anyway anyway
Clich clich clich clich
Who wants that hero love that saves the day anyway
Clich clich clich clich
What about the bad guy goes good yeah
An innocent love Im misunderstood yeah
Black hour glass our glass
Toast to clichs in a dark past
Toast to clichs in a dark past
Boy meets girl girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces chugging DUSS ugh
Fuck what you say boys in blue say
I dont care if we on the run
Baby as long Im next to you
Uhuu 
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
Why
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they dont know
Theyre nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I dont care if they come noooo
I know its crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
Im an outlaw got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac on my outlaw shit
Matching tats this Ink dont come off
Even if rings come off if things ring off
My nails get dirty my past aint pretty
My lady is my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100 hit the lottery niggas
You aint about that life aint gotta lie to me nigga
You know its till the death I hope its obvi to niggas
Ugh
Cross the line speak about mine
Ima wave this TEC Im a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at I click clack
Push your mothafuckin wig back I did that
I been wilding since a juvi she was a good girl
til she knew me now she is in the drop bustin Ueys screaming
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
Deeper than words beyond right
Die for your love beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on police in sight
Oh what a beautiful death lets both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me bring a box of Ls
She fell in love with the bad guy the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys them rap guys
They aint see potential in me girl but you see it
If its me and you against the world then so be it
I dont care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
Uhuu 
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they dont know
Theyre nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I dont care if they come noooo
I know its crazy but
I dont care Ill never give it up
Give it up give it up give it all away
No I swear Ill never give it up
Give it up give it up give it all away
I dont care Ill never give it up
Give it up give it up give it all away
No I swear Ill never give it up
Give it up give it up give it all away
Without you I got nothing to lose
