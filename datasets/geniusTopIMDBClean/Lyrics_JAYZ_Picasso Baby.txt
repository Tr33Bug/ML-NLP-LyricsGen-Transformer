Im never satisfied cant knock my hustle
I want a Rothko no I want a brothel
No I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute

In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling uh
All for the love of drug dealing uh
Marble floors uh gold ceilings uh
Oh what a feeling
Fuck it I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos I wanna row of

Bacons and turkey bacons smell the aroma
Oh what a feeling

Surrounded by Warhols my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes

Vogueing on these niggas champagne on my breath yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Cause I be going ape at the auction

Aw fuck it I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner

Okay I never stuck my cock in the foxs box but
Damned if I aint open Pandoras box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas dont stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like Old man just stop
I could if I would but I cant Im hot
And you blow Im still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again got my hands in cuff
Im like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs go through cribs and other things
No sympathy for the king huh
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Dont forget America this how you made me
Come through with the Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO I wont scratch the Lambo
Whats it gon take for me to go for you to see
Im the modern day Pablo Picasso baby
