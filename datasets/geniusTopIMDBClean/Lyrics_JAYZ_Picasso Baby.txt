Uh, I just want a Picasso
In my casa, no, my castle
I'm a hassa, no, I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I want a Rothko, no, I want a brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million
In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling, uh
All for the love of drug dealing, uh
Marble floors, uh, gold ceilings, uh
Oh, what a feeling
Fuck it, I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso, baby
Picasso
Picasso, baby
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso, baby
Picasso
Picasso, baby

It ain't hard to tell, I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me throning at the Met
Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
'Cause I be going ape at the auction
Oh, what a feeling
Aw, fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go 'head, lean on that shit, Blue, you own it, uh
You might also like
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso, baby
Picasso
Picasso, baby
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso, baby
Picasso
Picasso, baby

Woman: Et là je t'ai tout donné, montré, rien à cacher, tu es là Ivy, comme le nombre d'or
Jay, comment tu dis nombre d'or?
Jay-Z: The golden number
Woman: Touché

Okay, I never stuck my cock in the fox's box, but
Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like, "Old man, just stop"
I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn, enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America, this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon' take for me to go, for you to see?
I'm the modern day Pablo Picasso, baby38Embed
