In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling uh
All for the love of drug dealing uh
Marble floors uh gold ceilings uh

Jeff Koons balloons I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos I wanna row of

Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa

Okay I never stuck my cock in the foxs box but
Damned if I aint open Pandoras box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas dont stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like Old man just stop
I could if I would but I cant Im hot
And you blow Im still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again got my hands in cuff
Im like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs go through cribs and other things
No sympathy for the king huh
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Dont forget America this how you made me
Come through with the Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO I wont scratch the Lambo
Whats it gon take for me to go for you to see
Im the modern day Pablo Picasso baby
