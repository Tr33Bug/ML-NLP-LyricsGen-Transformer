This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at RocAFella Records
Fellow Americans it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation
Allow me to reintroduce myself
My name is Hov oh HtotheOV
I used to move snowflakes by the OZ
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the ROC Hov
Fresh out the fryin pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin my chain thats right
Hov oh not DOC
But similar to them letters No One Can Do It Better
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me Dude finish your breakfast
So thats what Ima do take you back to the dude with the Lexus
Fastforward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors
This aint a movie dog  Oh shit 
Now before I finish let me just say I did not come here to show out did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here Im gone
And I dont care what you think about mebut just remember when it hits the fan brother whether its next year ten years twenty years from now youll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you jack
Ving aint lie
I done came through the block in everything thats fly
Im like Che Guevara with bling on Im complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga I get my By any means on whenever theres a drought
Get your umbrellas out because thats when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn but I aint invent the game
I just rolled the dice trying to get some change
And Id do it twice aint no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There aint no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you dont think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then how would you explain
Im ten years removed still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit nigga period
Check out my hat yo peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag yo I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go you are what you are player
And you can try to change but thats just the top layer
Man you was who you was fore you got here
Only God can judge me so Im gone
Either love me or leave me alone
Now back to our regularly scheduled program LAlbum Noir The Black Album
