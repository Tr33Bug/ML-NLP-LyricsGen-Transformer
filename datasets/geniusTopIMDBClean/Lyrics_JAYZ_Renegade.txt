Motherfuckers say that Im foolish I only talk about jewels  Blingbling 
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
See Im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin I made somethin doin
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist its just his ghetto point of view
The renegade you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies niggas crouched over
Mamis knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked No hes not around
Now how that sound to ya Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin round
Hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
I help them see they way through it not you
Cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth youll lose your tie and your shirt
Since Im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I aint no politician but Ill kick it with em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits Ill wear it
But if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now whos the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
Usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
But theres a huge interference theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
Maybe its hatred I spew maybe its food for the spirit
Maybe its beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But Im debated disputed hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin drug addict like you didnt experiment
Now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin dogooders too bad you couldnt do good at marriage  Haha 
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I dont think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go hes JiggaJurJiggaJihJigga
And Im the sinister Mr KissMyAss is just a
Renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade
Never been afraid to talk about anything
Anything  anything  Anything 
Renegade never been afraid to say
Whats on my mind at any given time of day
Cause Im a renegade
Never been afraid to holler about anything
Anything  anything  Anything 
I had to hustle my back to the wall ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint not a cent
Gotta vent lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin Gotta pay rent bring dollars in
By the bodega iron under my coat feelin braver
Durag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
Im awkward I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me
And often my mama wasnt home
Could not stress to me I wasnt grown
Specially on nights I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it multi before I die
No lie just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
See Im a poet to some a regular modernday Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the king of these Latterday Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate satanist scatterbrained atheist
But that aint the case see its a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shadys as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See its as easy as cake simple as whistlin Dixie
While Im wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
Im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do  Huh  Im just a kid from the gutter
Makin his butter off these bloodsuckers cause Im a motherfuckin
