Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin babies see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids but shes a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that shes a thespian
Had to hide in the closet so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take

All these people was gon kill me heh
Cause the more I reveal me the more they fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter smile
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because thats what you want them to see
Living two lives happy but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say its time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them no harm for me
But life is short and its time to be free
Love who you love because life isnt guaranteed
Smile
