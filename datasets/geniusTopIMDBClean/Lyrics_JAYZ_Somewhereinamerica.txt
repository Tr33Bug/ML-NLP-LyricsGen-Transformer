TranslationsFranais
See what you made me do
Shout out to old Jews and old rules
New blacks with new stacks
I already been the king
Retro act Im just bringing it back like Jordan Packs
New money they looking down on me
Blue bloods they trying to clown on me
You can turn up your nose high society
Never gone turn down the homie
Knock knock Im at your neighbor house
Straight cash I bought ya neighbor out
You should come to the housewarming
Come and see what your new neighbor bout  SKIRRRRR 
Yellow Lambo in the driveway
A buck thirtyfive Im on the highway
Frank Sinatra on my Sonos
Loud as fuck I did it my way
A million sold before the album dropped
White Lexus before I had a deal
Ask Bun B about me
This aint no snap back a nigga been trill
By the way fuck your mag
You aint gotta count it my nigga I can add
1 million 2 million 3 million 20 million
Oh Im so good at math
Might crash ya Internet
And I aint even into that
When I was talking Instagram
Last thing you wanted was your picture snapped
Feds still lurking
They see Im still putting work in
Cause somewhere in America
Miley Cyrus is still twerkin
Twerk twerk  Miley Miley 
Only in America
