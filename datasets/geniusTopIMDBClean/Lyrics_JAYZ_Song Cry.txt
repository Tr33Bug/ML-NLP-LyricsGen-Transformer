Picture all the possibilities
Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible baby
Uh
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Yeah yeah
Uh
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Good dude I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel firstclass to change the forecast
Never in bunches just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
Its been months since I checked back in
Were somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin a mall down
Woodgrain four and change Armor Alld down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I cant let you know it pride wont let me show it
Pretend to be heroic thats just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry uh
Cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
On repeat the CD of Bigs Me  My Bitch
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde pretendin to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand sayin Let me see that clip
Shopping sprees pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
Thats when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine I dont know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick let me see thats it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldnt touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbedout buggy
And then they got fuzzy and they dont remember that
And I dont remember you
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah I seen em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I cant see it comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
A face of stone was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then
You have given away without gettin at me
Thats your fault how many times you forgiven me
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me
I know the way a nigga livin was wack
But you dont get a nigga back like that
Shit Im a man with pride you dont do shit like that
You dont just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You dont throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin them girls I was gon get right back
They say you cant turn a bad girl good
But once a good girls gone bad shes gone forever
Ill mourn forever
Shit Ive got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know I seen em comin down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I cant see em comin down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Its fucked up girl
