TranslationsPortugusThe Story of OJ Lyrics
Skin is skin is
Skin black my skin is black
My black my skin is yellow
Light nigga dark nigga faux nigga real nigga
Rich nigga poor nigga house nigga field nigga
Still nigga still nigga
I like that second one
Light nigga dark nigga faux nigga real nigga
Rich nigga poor nigga house nigga field nigga
Still nigga still nigga
OJ like Im not black Im OJ okay
House nigga dont fuck with me
Im a field nigga with shined cutlery
Goldplated quarters where the butlers be
Ima play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him Please dont die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
Thats how you rinse it
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin
I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how Im feelin Dumbo
Light nigga dark nigga faux nigga real nigga
Rich nigga poor nigga house nigga field nigga
Still nigga still nigga
Light nigga dark nigga faux nigga real nigga
Rich nigga poor nigga house nigga field nigga
Still nigga still nigga
You wanna know whats more important than throwin away money at a strip club Credit
You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America This how they did it
Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin rich and dyin broke
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later that shit worth two million
Few years later that shit worth eight million
I cant wait to give this shit to my children
Yall think its bougie Im like its fine
But Im tryin to give you a million dollars worth of game for 999
I turned that 2 to a 4 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Yall out here still takin advances huh
Me and my niggas takin real chances uh
Yall on the Gram holdin money to your ear
Theres a disconnect we dont call that money over here yeah
Light nigga dark nigga faux nigga real nigga
Rich nigga poor nigga house nigga field nigga
Still nigga still nigga
Light nigga dark nigga faux nigga real nigga
Rich nigga poor nigga house nigga field nigga
Still nigga still nigga
