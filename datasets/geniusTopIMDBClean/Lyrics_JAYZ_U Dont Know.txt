Turn my music high high high higher
You dont know what youre doin doin doin 
Sure I do
Im from the streets where the hood could swallow em and
Bulletsd follow em and
Theres so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
And say that we are prone to violence but its home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like its Wall Street holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham one slip you are now gone
Welcome to Hell where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come you better return em
All scars we earn em
All cars we learn em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest I dont need Dapper Dan
This aint a sewn outfit holmes holmes is about it
Was clappin them flamers before I became famous
For playin me yall shall forever remain nameless
I am Hov  You dont know what youre doin doin doin 
Sure I do
I tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin to get they ones Im tryin to get them Ms
One million two million three million four
In just five years forty million more
You are now lookin at the forty million boy
Im rapin Def Jam til Im the hundred million man
ROC  You dont know what youre doin doin doin 
Thats where youre wrong
I came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact from grindin Gpacks
Put this shit in motion aint no rewindin me back
Could make forty off a brick but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told em that Hov would sell clothin
Not in this lifetime wasnt in my right mind
Thats another difference thats between me and them
I smarten up open the market up
One million two million three million four
In eighteen months eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin at one smart Black boy
Mama aint raise no fool
Put me anywhere on Gods green earth Ill triple my worth motherfucker
I will not lose  You dont know what youre doin doin doin 
Put somethin on it
I sell ice in the winter I sell fire in Hell
I am a hustler baby Ill sell water to a whale
I was born to get cake move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate never follow orders dick face
Get your shit straight fucker this is Big Jay
I hahahaha  You dont know what youre doin doin doin 
Will not lose ever
Fucker
