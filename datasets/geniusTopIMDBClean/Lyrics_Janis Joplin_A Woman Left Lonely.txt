A woman left lonely will soon grow tired of waiting
Shell do crazy things yeah on lonely occasions
A simple conversation for the new men now and again
Makes a touchy situation when a good face come into your head
And when she gets lonely shes thinking about her man
She knows hes taking her for granted yeah yeah
Honey she doesnt understand no no no no
Well the fevers of the night they burn an unloved woman
Yeah those redhot flames try to push old love aside
A woman left lonely shes the victim of her man yes she is
When he cant keep up his own way good Lord
Shes got to do the best that she can yeah
A woman left lonely Lord that lonely girl
Lord Lord Lord
