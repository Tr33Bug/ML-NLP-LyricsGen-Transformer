This Is Janis Joplin the song is called apple of my eye
Well you dont know me baby like I know myself
If you leave me baby honestly I would kill myself
Honey cause I love you baby seems every day you know and every night
Yeah and I got me fifteen minute waitin time
You are the apple of my eye
Well Ive been to New York and Ive been to Chicago too
Ive been to San Francisco Seattle Los Angeles and Ive always come home
To you
Baby cause I love you baby seems every day you know and every night
Lord I got me fifteen minute waitin time
You are the apple of my eye
I got a man in Sixty Seven honey I got a man and some books to read
I got a big guitar I got them short and small they dont mean a damn thing
To me
Honey cause I love you baby seems every day you know and every night
Lord now I got me fifteen minute waitin time
You are the apple of my eye
Dont tell your honey you dont know me baby thats right like I know
Myself
Honey If you leave me baby hon I will kill myself
Honey cause I love you baby seems every day you know and every night
Lord now I got me fifteen minute waitin time
You are the apple of my eye Yeah
