Apple Of My Eye LyricsThis Is Janis Joplin, the song is called "apple of my eye."
Well you don't know me baby, like I know myself
If you leave me baby, honestly I would kill myself
Honey, cause I love you baby, seems every day you know and every night
Yeah and I got me fifteen minute waitin' time
You are the apple of my eye
Well I've been to New York, and I've been to Chicago too
I've been to San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and I've always come home
To you
Baby, 'cause I love you baby, seems every day you know and every night
Lord I got me fifteen minute waitin' time
You are the apple of my eye
I got a man in Sixty Seven honey, I got a man and some books to read
I got a big guitar, I got them short and small, they don't mean a damn thing
To me
Honey 'cause I love you baby, seems every day you know and every night
Lord now I got me fifteen minute waitin' time
You are the apple of my eye
Don't tell your honey, you don't know me baby, that's right like I know
Myself
Honey If you leave me baby, hon I will kill myself
Honey 'cause I love you baby, seems every day you know and every night
Lord now I got me fifteen minute waitin' time
You are the apple of my eye YeahYou might also likeEmbed
