Live your loving life
Live it all the best you can
And if you pay no attention darling
To what you might ever hear from your man
I think youre just like a servant
And try to keep it all to yourself
Dont you know it makes the world go round
You got to go and honey share everywhere else
Come on come on come on
As good as youve been to this world
So good I want to be right back to you
As good as youve been now
As good as youve been to this whole wide world
So good I want to be
As good as youve been now say
As good as youve been to this whole wide world
As good as youve been babe
So good I want to be here
Its no use in being faithful
I see you look at the sky
I know whats in it make you happy there
But it only make you cry
I think you got good intentions too
They dont manage to show through
Whatever you give to the world outside
I want to give it right back to you yes I am
Come on come on come on
So you meet somebody on the street
You know you treat him mighty fine
Or you meet somebody on the street
And you give him a real hard time
Its gonna come on home baby
I said its going to come right back home to you
I said its going to visit you now
Yes it is oh yes it is
As good as youve been to this world
So good I want to be right back to you
As good as youve been now
As good as youve been to this whole wide world
So good I want to be
As good as youve been now say
As good as youve been to this whole wide world
As good as youve been babe
So good I want to be here
Good as youve been babe hurrah
Good as youve been babe hey
Good as youve been babe hey
Good as youve been babe
Because Im just going to show you now
And Im just going to make you want it now
Because I m just going to give you a thrill
