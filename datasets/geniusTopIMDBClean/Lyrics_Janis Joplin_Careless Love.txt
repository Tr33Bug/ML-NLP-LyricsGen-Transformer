Oh love oh love oh careless love
Oh love oh love oh careless love
Oh love oh love oh careless love
Now now dont you see what your careless love has done
Well you worried my mother until she died
And you caused my father to lose his mind
Now damn you Im going to shoot you Lord Im going to shoot you both right down
Im going to spare no one of you child until you spin next dying
Careless love now dont know see how you follow me down
Careless love dont you see how you follow me down
Well you robbed me out of my silver Lord and out of my gold
Ever since you been riding by my side
