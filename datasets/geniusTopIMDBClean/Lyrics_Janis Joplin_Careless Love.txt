Careless Love Lyrics
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love
Now, now don't you see what your careless love has done

Well you worried my mother until she died
And you caused my father to lose his mind
Now damn you I'm going to shoot you, Lord, I'm going to shoot you both right down
I'm going to spare no one of you child until you spin next dying

Careless love now don't know see how you follow me down
Careless love, don't you see how you follow me down
Well, you robbed me out of my silver, Lord, and out of my gold
Ever since you been riding by my side
