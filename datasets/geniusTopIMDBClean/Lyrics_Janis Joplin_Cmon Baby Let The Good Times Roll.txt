Come on baby let the good times roll
Come on baby let me thrill your soul
Come on baby youre the best there is
Roll all night long
Come on baby lets close the door
Come on baby lets ride some more
Come on baby let the good times roll
Roll all night long
I feel so good when youre home
Come on baby lets ride some more
Come on baby rock me all night long
Roll all night long
Roll all night long
