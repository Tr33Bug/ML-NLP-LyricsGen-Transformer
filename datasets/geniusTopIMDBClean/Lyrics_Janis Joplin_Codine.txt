On the day I was born the Grim Reaper smiled
He said Ill get you yet now you demonized child
But Is younger than all my brothers
You know its all thats left of mine
Honey but I caught em
Yeah I passed em hon I left em left em with some Codine
And its real lord its real yeah one more time
Now I seem to recall when Is a young girl
How my joys and my happiness you know all seemed to whirl
But then somethings honey sometimes somehow it seems
Oh codine became so liked it took my dreams
Hon and its real lord its real yeah one more time
Its the reason I breath honey its the reason I walk
Its the reason I sleep and the reason I talk
Yeah but soon my devotion will all be repaid
For codine will kill me honey thats the bargin that weve made
And its real lord its real yeah one more time
And after Im gone and this sad race is run
Guess Ill go down to hell where my life was begun
But therell be somebody with me child that wont leave me alone
Oh codinell be waitin to punish my role
Hon its real lord its real one more time
Yeah and after Im gone and the mornin sets in
Dont you morn what I was girl norn what might have been
Morn my sad heart honey my tear filled eyes
Morn the codeine that I need that I crave and I despise
Hon its real lord its real one more time
Yeah its real lord its real one more time
