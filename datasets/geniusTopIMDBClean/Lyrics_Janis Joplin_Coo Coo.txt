Oh the cuckoo she is a pretty bird and she warbles when she flies
But she never hollers cuckoo till the fourth day of July
Said Jack diamonds well Jack diamonds oh I know you of old
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold
All of my gold all of my gold
Well Jack diamonds oh Jack diamonds oh I know you of old
Honey you robbed me of my silver and out of all my gold
Said the cuckoo she is a cruel bird and she warbles when she flies
And every time that she passes my true love says goodbye
Well says goodbye well says goodbye
Ooh ooh
