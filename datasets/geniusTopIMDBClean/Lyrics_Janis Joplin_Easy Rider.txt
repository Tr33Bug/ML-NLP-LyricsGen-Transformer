Hey mama mama come a look at sister
Shes standing on the levee trying to do that twist
But easy rider do not you deny my name
Oh no oh no
Well I got a girl with a diamond ring
I will tell you boys she knows how to shake that thing
Well I got a horse and he lives in a tree
He watches Huckleberry Hound on his TV
I would buy you a plastic suit
And I would even buy you some cardboard fruit
Yeah easy rider do you deny my name pretty baby doll
