Please dont you think baby that I am wrong to cry yeah
You loved me too
So how come you just sit there and laugh
And laugh and laugh and laugh
Things just cant be this way
And not for very long
No no no
Our love affair said its just history yes it is
And I tried to love you in my own way
I think that you know I did
But to have you here to see you living
Oh so near to me yeah yeah yeah
Oh but you are distant and so its dead
And so often people are glad to be old yeah yeah
Our love affair is just history yes it is
Once in a green time a flower
Oh fell in love with the sun
The passion lasted for an hour
And then she wilted from her loved one
And I see you looking up at the sky how high it is yeah
You wonder if there is whoa another me
Now how can that be how can it be 
Well I sit here and I ask you why all this
I just got tonight
Our love affair said its just a history
But baby baby I said its over Charlie
I cant stand another lonely
Im never too lonely
Its over baby
Where were you when I wanted you
And needed you right by my side
I said baby baby dont you feel me moving
Baby dont you hear me cry
I know I hurt you but Lord dont you know I cried
I know I hurt you but babe dont you know I tried
Oh baby oh babe whoa
