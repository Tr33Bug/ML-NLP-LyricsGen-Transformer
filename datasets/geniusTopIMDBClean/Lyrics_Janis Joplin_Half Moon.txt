Half moon night time sky
Seven stars heavens eyes
Seven songs on seven seas
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me
Hey you fill me like the mountains
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You fill me like the sea Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me hey
Rings of cloud and arms aflame
Wings rise up to call your name
Sun rolls high Lord it burns the ground
Just to tell about the first good man I found
Hey you fill me like the mountains
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You fill me like the sea Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me hey
Half moon night time sky
Seven stars heavens eyes
Seven songs on seven seas
Just to bring all your sweet love home to me
Hey you fill me like the mountains
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You fill me like the sea Lord
Not coming past but still at last
Your love brings life to me
Your love brings life to me hey
Hey you fill me like the mountains
