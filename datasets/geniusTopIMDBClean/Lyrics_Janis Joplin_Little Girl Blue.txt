Sit there hmm count your fingers
What else what else is there to do
Oh and I know how you feel
I know you feel that youre through
Oh wah wah ah sit there hmm count
Ah count your little fingers
My unhappy oh little girl little girl blue yeah
Oh sit there oh count those raindrops
Oh feel them falling down oh honey all around you
Honey dont you know its time
I feel its time
Somebody told you because you got to know
That all you ever going to have to count on
Or going to want to lean on
Its going to feel just like those raindrops do
When theyre falling down honey all around you
Oh I know youre unhappy
Oh sit there
Oh go on go on and count your fingers
I know what else what else
Honey youve got to do
And I know how you feel
And I know you aint got no reason to go on
And I know that you feel you must be through
Oh honey go on and sit right back down
I want you to count oh count your fingers
Ah my unhappy my unlucky and my little poor girl blue
I know youre unhappy
Oh ah hon I know
Baby I know just how you feel
