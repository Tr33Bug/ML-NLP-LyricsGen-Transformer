Mary Jane Lyrics
Now when I go to work, I work all day
Always turns out the same
When I bring home my hard-earned pay
I spend my money all on Mary Jane

Mary Jane, Mary Jane, Lord, my Mary Jane

Oh if a man should look tame now, mean and mature
They all turns out the same
Because they can't do nothing to make a man feel good
Like my old Mary Jane

Now I walk in the street now looking for a friend
One that can lend me some change
And he never questions my reason why
Because he too loves Mary Jane


Well I have known women that wanted no man
Some that wanted to say
But I never knew what happened in this world
Until I met up with Mary Jane


Oh when I'm feeling lonesome and I'm feeling blue
There's only one way to change
Now I walk down the street now looking for a man
One that knows my Mary Jane
