Now when I go to work I work all day
Always turns out the same
When I bring home my hardearned pay
I spend my money all on Mary Jane
Mary Jane Mary Jane Lord my Mary Jane
Oh if a man should look tame now mean and mature
They all turns out the same
Because they cant do nothing to make a man feel good
Like my old Mary Jane
Now I walk in the street now looking for a friend
One that can lend me some change
And he never questions my reason why
Because he too loves Mary Jane
Well I have known women that wanted no man
Some that wanted to say
But I never knew what happened in this world
Until I met up with Mary Jane
Oh when Im feeling lonesome and Im feeling blue
Theres only one way to change
Now I walk down the street now looking for a man
One that knows my Mary Jane
