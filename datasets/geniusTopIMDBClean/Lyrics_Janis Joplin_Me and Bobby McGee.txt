Busted flat in Baton Rouge waitin for a train
When I was feelin near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
That rode us all the way in to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin soft while Bobby sang the blues yeah
Windshield wipers slappin time I was holdin Bobbys hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose
Nothin dont mean nothin honey if it aint free no no
Yeah feelin good was easy Lord when he sang the blues
You know feelin good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather through everything we done
Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas Lord I let him slip away
Hes lookin for that home and I hope he finds it
But Id trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin Bobbys body next to mine
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose
Nothin and thats all that Bobby left me
Well feelin good was easy Lord when he sang the blues
Hey feelin good was good enough for me mhm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
