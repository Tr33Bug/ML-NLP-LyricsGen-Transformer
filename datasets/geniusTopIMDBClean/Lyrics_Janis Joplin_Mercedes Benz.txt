Id like to do a song
Of great social and political import
It goes like this
Oh Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime no help from my friends
So Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz
Oh Lord wont you buy me a color TV
Dialing For Dollars is trying to find me
I wait for delivery each day until three
So oh Lord wont you buy me a color TV
Oh Lord wont you buy me a night on the town
Im counting on you Lord please dont let me down
Prove that you love me and buy the next round
Oh Lord wont you buy me a night on the town
Oh Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz
My friends all drive Porsches I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime no help from my friends
So Lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz
Spoken
Thats it   cackle
