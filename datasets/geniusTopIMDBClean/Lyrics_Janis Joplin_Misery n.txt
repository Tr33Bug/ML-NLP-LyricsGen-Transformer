Misery â€™n Lyrics
I've been misery and
Ever since my daddy gone, yeah
I've been, honey, I've been misery and, yes I have, now
Ever since my, since my daddy gone, gone, gone
But I believe that it won't
Baby, it won't be too long
If I just could hang on
Yeah, until my, until my misery
Will all be gone
Whoa, I said my rooms, you know
They're so empty, empty, empty, empty, empty
Filled up with sadness, sometimes, yeah
My rooms are so empty, empty, empty, empty
Child, filled up with sadness, honey, sometimes, sometimes
Oh well it just, it just moves in
Like the fog rolls in
And I find I, well I can't see you, baby
For my tears

But I've tried
Don't you know I've tried
Cried, cried, cried, cried, cried
Baby now, I've been missing you
Oh, I've been missing you, babe!

Yeah, and it all seems to bother me
Much more that it seems it should be
So, baby, now, now
Baby, now, now
Baby, tell me why
Does it have to be
Oh, so wrong for me?
You might also likeI never thought I could ever want anybody
No, no, no, never did, I never did
Why am I feeling so strange?
Whoa, I never, never, never needed nobody, no, no
But maybe you could help me
Why am I feeling so strange?
Yeah, and I've got me a great
And I've got a great big bed
With two pillows for my head
Hey, but lately I been sleeping, sleeping alone
