You say that its over baby Lord
You say that its over now
But still you hang around me come on
Wont you move over
You know that I need a man honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please dont you do it to me babe no
Please dont you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be
Im not quite ready for walking no no no no
Im not quite ready for walking
And what are you going to do with your life
Life all just dangling
Oh yeah make up your mind honey
Youre playing with me hey hey hey
Make up your mind darling
Youre playing with me come on now
Now either be my loving man
I said let me honey let me be yeah
You say that its over baby Lord
You say that its over now
But still you hang around me come on
Wont you move over
You know that I need a man honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please dont you do it to me babe no
Please dont you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be
I said wont you wont you let me be
Honey youre teasing me
Yeah youre playing with my heart dear
I believe youre toying with my affections honey

And furthermore I dont intend to
Im just tired of hanging from the end of a string honey
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
Wah wah wah wah honey
