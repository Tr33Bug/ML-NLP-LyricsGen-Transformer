You say that its over baby Lord
You say that its over now
But still you hang around me come on
Wont you move over
You know that I need a man honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please dont you do it to me babe no
Please dont you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be
Im not quite ready for walking no no no no

And what are you going to do with your life
Life all just dangling
Oh yeah make up your mind honey
Youre playing with me hey hey hey
Make up your mind darling

You say that its over baby Lord
You say that its over now
But still you hang around me come on
Wont you move over
You know that I need a man honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can
Please dont you do it to me babe no
Please dont you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be

You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
