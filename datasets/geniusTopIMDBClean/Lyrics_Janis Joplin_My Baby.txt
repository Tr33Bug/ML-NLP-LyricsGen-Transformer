And when I work hard all day long
I tell you what it dont bother me nohow
Because how could anything ever go wrong
When I got my baby Lord yes
When I got my baby oh Lord
And when they tell me love is pain
I said it might be true for you honey
But not for Janis no more no no no no
All Ive ever got to do is call my daddys name
Honey I want to tell you something that I do
Deep down honey in the dark of the night
When I lay my head down I want to go to sleep
And I know everything is going to be alright
And when I want to call the names
Or the things to be that want to be to you
And when I want to reach out my hand
It always seems you hold me dear
Love dont you know how long I looked for you
Daddy daddy daddy
Love dont you know how hard I tried
