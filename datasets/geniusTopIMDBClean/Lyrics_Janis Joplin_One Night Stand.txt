When Im on the road playing in a town without a name
And Im feeling low and everybody looks the same
Well you catch my eye and then you come on strong and try to make your play
Just because we loved tonight please dont you think its going to stay that way
Dont you know that youre nothing more than a one night stand
Tomorrow Ill be on my way and you can catch me if you can
Honey take me by the hand and play that game again yeah
Everywhere I go the people wanna make some time with me
Thats okay if the next day I can be free
Well its feeling good and youre the one Im loving tonight
Well dont you go and spoil it babe by trying to get yourself all uptight
Dont you know that youre nothing more than a one night stand
Lord Lord
