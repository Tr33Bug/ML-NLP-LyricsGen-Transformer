Trust in me baby give me time give me time um give me time
I heard somebody say oh The older the grape
Sweeter the wine sweeter the wine
Oh my love is like a seed baby just needs time to grow
Its growing stronger day by day yeah
Thats the price youve got to pay
Trust in me baby give me time gimme time please a little more time
Takes a road runner just a little bit longer dear
Oh to make up my mind I got to make up my mind
I got know know that Im ready oh ready to settle down
Because I think too much of your loving baby
Yeah I dont want to mess your life around
So if you love me like you tell me that youre doing dear
You shouldnt mind paying the price any price any price
Love is supposed to be that special kind of thing
Make anybody want to sacrifice
Trust in me baby trust in me baby
Trust in my love in my heart
Keep the faith baby keep the faith in me dear in my love
Dont turn your face away from me dear oh you leave a lost girl
Oh dont turn your love away no no no no no no no
