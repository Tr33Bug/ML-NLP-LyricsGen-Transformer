What good can drinking do what good can drinking do
Lord I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue
Theres a glass on the table they say its going to ease all my pain 
But I drink it down and the next day I feel the same
Give me whiskey give me bourbon give me gin 
Because it doesnt matter what Im drinking Lord
As long as it drowns this sorrow Im in
I start drinking Friday I start drinking Friday night 
But then I wake up on Sunday child theres nothing thats right
My man he left me child he left me here 
Lord Im feeling lowdown just give me another glass of beer
