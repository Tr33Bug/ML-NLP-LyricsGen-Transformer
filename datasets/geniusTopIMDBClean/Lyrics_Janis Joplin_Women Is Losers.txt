Women is losers
Women is losers oh
Say honey women is losers
Well I know you must try Lord
And everywhere
Men almost seem to end up on top
Oh if they told you they want you
Say come around by your door
Whoa I say now if they do not desert you
Theyll leave you and never be here for more
Oh yeah
They wear a nice shiny armor
Until there is a dragon for to slay
Any day now
Course with men beginning to pay them
Then theyll turn and run away oh
