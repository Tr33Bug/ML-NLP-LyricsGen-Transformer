Work me Lord work me Lord
Please dont you leave me
I feel so useless down here
With no one to love
Though Ive looked everywhere
And I cant find me anybody to love
To feel my care
So ah work me Lord whoa use me Lord
Dont you know how hard it is
Trying to live all alone
Every day I keep trying to move forward
But something is driving me oh back
Honey somethings trying to hold on to me
To my way of life
So dont you forget me down here Lord
No no no no no no no no no
Ah ah dont you forget me Lord
Well I dont think Im any very special
Kind of person down here I know better
But I dont think youre going to find anybody
Not anybody who could say that they tried like I tried
The worst you can say all about me
Is that Im never satisfied Whoa
Oh please please oh dont you go and
Forget me down here dont forget me Lord
I think that maybe you can ease me
Maybe I can help you said uh whoa
Oh please please dont you go and leave me Lord
No no no no no no no whoa whoa please
Hmm please dont you leave me Lord
