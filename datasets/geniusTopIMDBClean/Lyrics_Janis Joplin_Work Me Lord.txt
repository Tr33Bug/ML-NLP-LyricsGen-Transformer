Work Me, Lord Lyrics
Work me Lord, work me Lord
Please don't you leave me
I feel so useless down here
With no one to love
Though I've looked everywhere
And I can't find me anybody to love
To feel my care

So ah work me Lord, whoa use me Lord
Don't you know how hard it is
Trying to live all alone
Every day I keep trying to move forward
But something is driving me, oh, back
Honey, something's trying to hold on to me
To my way of life
So don't you forget me down here, Lord
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ah, ah, don't you forget me, Lord
Well, I don't think I'm any very special
Kind of person down here, I know better
But I don't think you're going to find anybody
Not anybody who could say that they tried like I tried
The worst you can say all about me
Is that I'm never satisfied, Whoa



Oh please, please, oh don't you go and
Forget me down here, don't forget me, Lord
I think that maybe you can ease me
Maybe I can help you, said uh whoa
Oh please, please, don't you go and leave me Lord
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, whoa, whoa please
Hmm please, don't you leave me, LordYou might also like1Embed
