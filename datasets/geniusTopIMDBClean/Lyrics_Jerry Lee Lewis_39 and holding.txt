Hes out there somewhere every night
The musics playin loud
Hes doing alla those fiftys steps
Hes in a 1980 crowd
Dim lights hide the milage line
Clairol hides the gray
And he wont mention anything
To give his old age away
Oh Lord hes thirtynine an hes holdin
Hes holdin everything that he can
From seventeen to twentyfive
Hell prove hes still a man
Hey boy youre holding to a candle
And its aburning at both ends
Thirtynine and holding
Aholdin everything that I can
Well now you can bet hell never see
Thirtynine again
Son you oughta given up a long time ago
But you just keep on hangin in
He still thinks that hes the man
That he once used to be
Boy youre just thirtynine
And youre dreamin
Acting twentythree
Ohoh hes thirtynine hes holdin
Holdin everything that he can
From seventeen to twentyfive
Hell prove hes still a man
Hes aholding to a candle
My God its burning at both ends
Hes thirtynine and hes holdin
Holdin everything he can
