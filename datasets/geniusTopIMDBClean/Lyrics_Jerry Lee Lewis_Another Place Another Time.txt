One by one theyre turning out the lights
Ive been feedin that ol jukebox just to hold you tight
I guess its for the best I just put in my last dime
I heard you whisper Well meet again another place another time
Chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say
I could wait right here forever if theyd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than lonely room of mine
Through a lonely night a waitin for another place another time
Wont that room of mine be a lonely place to be
Ive been so used to holding you close to me
Wont that old stairway be hard to climb
To a lonely room waiting for another place another time
Wont that old stairway be hard to climb
To a lonely room to wait for another place another time
