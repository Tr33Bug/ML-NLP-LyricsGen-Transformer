Baby Hold Me Close LyricsNow listen here baby to what old Jerry Lee has to say
Cause baby Jerry don't talk this nonsense to everyone
I want you to get out on this dance floor with me now
And now hold me close baby hold me close
In a tumbled move baby you move too
Baby you move me girl oh hold me close yeah
Mhm baby hold me close don't you move your feet
Just a move it slow baby to that old rockin' beat
And don't you say a word mhm honey just just hold me close
Oh baby hold me close dance the night away
Honey I want you to just breathe a little deep mhm you know what to say
Mhm when the band is gone honey we can still rock on
Easy now honey hold me close honey hold me tight
Squeeze old Jerry Lee all through the doggone night
Oh you know what I mean honey I can't stand much of this I might go plumb crazy
Easy now rrrrrrr uh huh huh
Oh you look so doggone good baby you turn me up and I don't mean maybe
Ah ha hha ha oh honey come on now let's go one time
Oh baby shake that thing hold me tight
I want you to hold me a little bit tighter baby all through the night
I can't stand much of this baby oh I might go plumb crazy now darlin'
Oh hold me close that's the way baby
Oh ain't that the oldest beat in the world darlin'You might also likeEmbed
