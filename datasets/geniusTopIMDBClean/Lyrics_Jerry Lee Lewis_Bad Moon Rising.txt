Bad Moon Rising LyricsI see the bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today
Well, don't go around tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I fear river's overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Well, don't go around tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's the bad moon on the rise
I hope you got your things together
I hope you're quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Oh, don't go around tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
There's a bad moon on the riseYou might also likeEmbed
