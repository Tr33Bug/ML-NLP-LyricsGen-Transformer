I see the bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin
I see bad times today
Well dont go around tonight
Its bound to take your life
Theres a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes ablowin
I know the end is comin soon
I fear rivers overflowin
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Well dont go around tonight
Its bound to take your life
Theres the bad moon on the rise
I hope you got your things together
I hope youre quite prepared to die
Looks like were in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Oh dont go around tonight
Its bound to take your life
Theres a bad moon on the rise
Theres a bad moon on the rise
