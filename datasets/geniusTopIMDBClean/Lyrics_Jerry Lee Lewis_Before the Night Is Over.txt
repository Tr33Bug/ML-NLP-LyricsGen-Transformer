I can tell by the way youre a little bit lonesome baby just like Jerry Lee
Its just like someone that youre needing to forget
Honey thats the same thing with me Ive been wanderin baby why dont we
Just make believe it aint the first time we have met
And before the night is over youre gonna be in love
I bet you by the mornin Ill be the only one that youll be thinkin of
So we will will come together as close as fingers in a glove
And before the night is over you gonna be in love
Woooo
Play a little piano I hear
Yeah
Honey I can tell Jerry Lee can tell somebody might put that lady there right through to hell
And she can use a little tenderness these things I know
O if you feel that its wrong Lord I could be comin on a little bit too strong
Just let me know Ill pack my jump I just might go
But before the night is over you gonna be in love
I bet you by the mornin Ill be the only one that youll be thinkin of
So we will come together as close as fingers in a glove
And before the night is over
I said before the night is over
Hey girl before the night is over you gonna be in love
Gonna be in love Whoa
