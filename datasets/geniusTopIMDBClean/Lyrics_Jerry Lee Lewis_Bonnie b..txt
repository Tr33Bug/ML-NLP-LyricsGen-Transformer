She stands out among the others you see
She makes me happy makes me feel so good

But were too young got a long time to wait

When she walks down the hall
Well all the kids all drool
With her long blond hair and cherry pink lips
Turned up nose that makes a cat wanna flip

Well I told Bonnie B to take a ride with me
Told her Id show her all she could see
She dont know but itll be too dark
But that lovers lane is where I plan to park
And Im gonna ask her if I can kiss her then
And if I can Im gonna do it again
More tenderly when I kiss my BonnieBonnie B

Well all the kids all drool
With her long blond hair and cherry pink lips
And turned up nose that makes a cat wanna flip
