Chantilly Lace LyricsHello, you good lookin' thing, you!
Yeah, huh?
Now, this is the Killer speaking
A-do I like what? I sure do like it, baby!
Chantilly lace, pretty face
A pony tail - hangin' down
A wiggle and a walk
A giggle and a talk;
It gon' make that world go 'round
Ain't nothin' in the world, like a big-eyed girl
That make me act so funny; spend my doggone money
I feel real, real loose, like a long-necked goose
Like a-
Woah, baby, that's what I like!
(Hello!)
Huh?
(Hello!)
But I what?
(Hello!)
Do I what?
(Hello!)
What, I what?
Can't never tell, baby, I
How am I?
But honey, you knows what I like
Chantilly lace (chantilly)
Pretty face (chantilly)
A pony tail - hangin' down (chantilly lace)
A wiggle and a walk (chantilly)
A little giggle and a talk; (chantilly)
It gonna make the world go 'round (chantilly lace)
You might also likeAin't nothin' in the world, like a big-eyed girl
That make me act a-so funny; spend my doggone money
I feel real, real loose, like a long-necked goose

Huh? Ha-ha-ha
Huh? What's that?
"Pick you up at eight"?
And "don't be late"?
Huh, you gotta be jokin' woman
I thought you might pick me up at eight and don't be late
It don't make no difference baby

You yap, and yap, and yap, and yap, and yap, but-
When you break it all down, you know what I like
