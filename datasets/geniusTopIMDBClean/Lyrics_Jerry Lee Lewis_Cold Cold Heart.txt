Ive tried so hard my dear to show that youre my every dream
Yet youre afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from the lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Another love before my time had made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying dear for things he really didnt do
In anger unkind words I said had make those teardrops start
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Youll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know I need I want your love yet youre afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just aint smart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
