Now blue aint the word for the way that I feel
An ol storms brewing in this heart of mine
This aint no crazy dream I know that its real
Youre someone elses love now youre not mine
Youve got crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying youre not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another youll be awed
Hey girl thats why Im so lonely all the time
You can take all those precious dreams I had just for you and me
Honey take all the love I thought was mine
Someday your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now Killers gettin lonesome all the time
Youve got crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying youre not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another youll be wed
Hey thats why Im so lonely all the time
Hey thats why Im so lonely all the time
