Crazy Arms LyricsNow, blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
An ol' storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine
You've got crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying "you're not mine"
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be a-wed
Hey, girl, that's why I'm so lonely all the time
You can take all those precious dreams I had just for you and me
Honey take all the love I thought was mine
Someday your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now, 'Killer's gettin' lonesome all the time
You've got crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying "you're not mine"
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
Hey, that's why I'm so lonely all the time
Hey, that's why I'm so lonely all the timeYou might also likeEmbed
