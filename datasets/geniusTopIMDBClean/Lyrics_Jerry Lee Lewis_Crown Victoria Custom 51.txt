Crown Victoria Custom â€™51 LyricsBorn in Detroit City Back in '51
She still looks pretty and she's Loads of fun
Through thick and thin she's been my only one
It's my Crown Victoria Custom '51
The Old Carborator got some head roaters Too
The winston and the Septor engine runs like new
Tear drop skirts, Shiny in the sun
She's my Crown Victoria Custom 51'
Snow white cover roll Front and Back
Speeds over 90 on the paper countack
Foot on the floor and the fifth in my hand
Till we gonna take it to the promis land
Ol' spoked wheels and Tranmitters too
Blinks red and white when the tale lights blew
Wide ball turn and I love the way she runs
She's my Crown Victoria Custom '51
Let's go now
(Piano solo)
Alright sun, here we go
(Guitar solo)
Chop down top, got the four footed dry
I Got my Pretty Baby sittin' By My side
Foot on the floor and the fifth in my hand
Let me rock n roll it to the promis land
Born in Detroit City Back in '51
Still looks pretty and she's Loads of fun
Thick and thin it's been my only one
It's my Crown Victoria Custom '51
It's my Crown Victoria Custom '51
She's my Crown Victoria Custom '51
