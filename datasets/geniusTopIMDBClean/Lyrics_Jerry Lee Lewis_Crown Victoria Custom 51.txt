Born in Detroit City Back in 51
She still looks pretty and shes Loads of fun
Through thick and thin shes been my only one
Its my Crown Victoria Custom 51
The Old Carborator got some head roaters Too
The winston and the Septor engine runs like new
Tear drop skirts Shiny in the sun
Shes my Crown Victoria Custom 51
Snow white cover roll Front and Back
Speeds over 90 on the paper countack
Foot on the floor and the fifth in my hand
Till we gonna take it to the promis land
Ol spoked wheels and Tranmitters too
Blinks red and white when the tale lights blew
Wide ball turn and I love the way she runs
Shes my Crown Victoria Custom 51
Lets go now
Piano solo 
Alright sun here we go
Guitar solo 
Chop down top got the four footed dry
I Got my Pretty Baby sittin By My side
Foot on the floor and the fifth in my hand
Let me rock n roll it to the promis land
Born in Detroit City Back in 51
Still looks pretty and shes Loads of fun
Thick and thin its been my only one
Its my Crown Victoria Custom 51
Its my Crown Victoria Custom 51
Shes my Crown Victoria Custom 51
Ford baby
