Down the Line LyricsWell, you can't be my lovin' baby
You ain't got the style
I'm a-gonna get some real gone love
That'll drive a cool cat wild
I wanna move, move on down the line
Gonna get me a gal, then I go out on the town
Well, I wanna move on down the line
I'm gonna get me a gal, make some time
She can't be square, she can't be slow
And when she starts a-struttin' she's gotta go
I'm gonna move, move on down the line
Well, I'm in love, have been all the time
Yeah, I'm gonna show you ain't so hot
I'm gonna get what you ain't got
She'll be sweet, won't do me wrong
She'll be cool and twice as gone
We're gonna roll on, roll on down the line
I'm gonna get some love, lovin' that's truly fine
Well, I wanna move on down the line
I'm gonna get some lovin, truly fine
A love that'll be twice as gone
And when she starts a-struttin' she's gotta go
I wanna move on, move on down the line
Well, I'm gonna do right, do right all the time
I'm gonna do right, do right all the timeYou might also likeEmbed
