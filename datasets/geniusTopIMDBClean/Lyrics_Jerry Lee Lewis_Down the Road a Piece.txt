Now if you wanna hear some boogie like Im gonna play
Its just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer mans a cat they call Kickin McCoy
You know remember that rubberlegged boy
Mamas cookin chicken fried and bacon grease
Come on along boys its just down the road a piece
Well theres a place you really get your kicks
Its open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road down the road down the road a piece
Theres a place you really get your kicks
Its open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road down the road down the road a piece
