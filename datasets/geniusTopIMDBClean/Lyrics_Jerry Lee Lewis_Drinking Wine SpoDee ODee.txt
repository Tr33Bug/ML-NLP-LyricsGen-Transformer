Down in New Orleans where everythings fine all them cats is drinkin that wine
Drinkin that mess is their delight when they get drunk start singin all night
Drinkin wine spodeeodee drinkin wine wine spodeeodee drinkin wine
Wine spodeeodee drinkin wine pass that bottle to me
Now Ive got a nickel have you got a dime lets get together and get a little wine
Some buys a gallon some buys a quart
When you buy black beer now youre doin things smart
Drinkin wine spodeeodee
Down on Rempart Street in Willies den he would sell but a gill of gin
One cat wanted a bottle of wine he hooked that cat for a dollar and a dime
Drinkin wine spodeeodee
