Drinking Wine Spo-Dee Oâ€™Dee LyricsDown in New Orleans where everything's fine all them cats is drinkin' that wine
Drinkin' that mess is their delight when they get drunk start singin' all night
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine pass that bottle to me
Now I've got a nickel have you got a dime let's get together and get a little wine
Some buys a gallon some buys a quart
When you buy black beer now you're doin' things smart
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee
Down on Rempart Street in Willie's den he would sell but a gill of gin
One cat wanted a bottle of wine he hooked that cat for a dollar and a dime
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-deeYou might also likeEmbed
