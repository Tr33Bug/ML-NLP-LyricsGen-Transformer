Well the way is dark the night is long
I dont care if I never get home
Im waitin at the end of the road
Well the stars may not shine and neither the moon
What the heck we dont want no moon
Im waitin yeah at the end of the road
You can jump in my Ford and you can give it a gas
Pull out the throttle dont give me no sass
Take your foot slap it on the floor
When we get together were gonna shake a little more
Oh the way is dark the night is long I dont care if I never get home
Im waitin uh huh at the end of the road yeah
Oh you can jump in my Ford
Lord Im waitin waitin waitin at the end of the road
