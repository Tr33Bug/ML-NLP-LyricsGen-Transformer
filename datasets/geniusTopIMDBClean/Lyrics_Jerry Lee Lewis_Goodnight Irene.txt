Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife have parted
Im going to take another stroll down town
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
Ill see you in my dreams
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a promotion
But Ill jump in the river and drown
Irene goodnight
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
Goodnight Irene
Ill see you in my dreams
