Great Balls of Fire  Live  LyricsYou shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
I laughed at love cause I thought it was funny
You came along and moved me honey
Ive changed my mind
Love is fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Kiss me baby mmm it feels good
Hold me baby
Girl just let me love you like a lover should
Youre fine so kind
Ima tell this world that youre mine mine mine mine
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
Im real nervous but it sure is fun
Cmon baby you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Well kiss me baby ooh it feels good
Hold me baby
I want to love you like a lover should
Youre fine so kind
I got to tell this world that youre mine mine mine mine
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
Im real nervous cause it sure is fun
Cmon baby you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
I said goodness gracious great balls of fire
Hoo
