You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
I laughed at love coz I thought it was funny
You came along and you moved me honey
Ive changed my mind
This love is fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Kiss me baby
Mmmmh it feels good
Hold me baby
Well Im off to love you like a lover should
Oh Youre fine so kind
Got to tell this world that youre mine mine mine mine
I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs
Im real nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby
You drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Well kiss me baby
Mmmmh it feels good
Hold me baby
Well Im off to love you like a lover should
Youre fine so kind
Got to tell this world that youre mine mine mine mine
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
Real nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby
Youre driving me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
