Down in Lousianer in the bright sunshine
They do a little boogiewoogie all the time
They do
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogiewoogie all the time
Astandin on the corner with my bottle in my hand
And up steps a mama said my Hadacol man
She done
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogiewoogie all the time
I went down to the farm to rest about a week
But the farmers wife she got to walkin in her sleep
She done
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogiewoogie all the time
If your radiator leaks and your motor stands still
Give er Hadacol and watch er boogie up the hill
Shell do
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogiewoogie all the time
The rooster and the hen they were standin in the shade
The rooster done the boogie while the hen laid the egg
He done
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogiewoogie all the time
The other little chickens they gathered around
They done the boogiewoogie til the sun went down
They done
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie  Hadacol Boogie 
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogiewoogie all the time
