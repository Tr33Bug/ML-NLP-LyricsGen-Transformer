Hello Josephine How do you do
Do you remember me baby like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler Woo woo woo
I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella evry time it rained
You used to cry so much it was a crying shame
Hello Josephine How do you do
Do you remember me baby like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler Woo woo woo
You used to live over yonder by the railroad track
When it rained you couldnt walk I used to tote you on my back
Now you gotta make believe it was a thrill at that
Hello Josephine How do you do
Do you remember me baby like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler Woo woo woo
