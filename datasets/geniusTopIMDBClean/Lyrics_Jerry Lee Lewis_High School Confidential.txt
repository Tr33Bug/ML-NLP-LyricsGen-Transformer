High School Confidential LyricsOpen up, a-honey, it's your lover boy me that's a-knockin'
Why don't you listen to me, sugar? All the cats are at the high school rockin'
Honey, get your boppin' shoes
'Fore the jukebox blow the fuse
Everybody hoppin'
Everybody's boppin'
Boppin' at the high school hop
They're boppin' at the high school hop
Shakin' at the high school hop
Hoppin' at the high school rock
Rockin' at the high school hop
Well, everybody hoppin'
Everybody's boppin'
Boppin' at the high school hop
Come on, little baby, let's rock a little bit tonight
Woo, let's get with it sugar, let's shake it up tonight
Well, my heart's a-beatin' rhythm and my feet are movin' smooth and light
Well, boppin' at the high school hop
Boppin' at the high school hop
Shakin' at the high school hop
Movin' at the high school hop
Everybody boppin'
Everybody rockin'
Boppin' at the high school hop
Now let's go!
Well, now let me tell you something, baby, I'ma gonna give you some good news
Look a-here, sweet mama, let's burn off both our shoes
Well, my heart's a-beatin' rhythm and my soul is singin' the blues
Well, boppin' at the high school hop
Hoppin' at the high school hop
We're just a-jumpin' at the high school hop
We're rollin' at the high school hop
Well, everybody hoppin'
Everybody's boppin'
Boppin' at the high school hop
Now let's go!
Woo!
