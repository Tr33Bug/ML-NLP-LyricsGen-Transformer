Iâ€™ll Make It All Up to You LyricsWell it's true so true I didn't do right by you
Guess I didn't know exactly what to do someday I'll make it all up to you
Well it's true so true I didn't do right by you
Guess I didn't know exactly what to do someday I'll make it all up to you
When we met I thought we'd be so happy that we would be so gay
But since we met I thought we'd be so happy but now you're gone away
Lord I'm blue so blue but baby I don't blame you
Guess I didn't know the right things to do someday I'll make it all up to you
When we met I thought we'd be so happy that we would be so gay
But since we met I thought we'd be so happy but now you're gone away
Lord I'm blue so blue but baby I don't blame you
Guess I didn't know the right things to do someday I'll make it all up to youYou might also likeEmbed
