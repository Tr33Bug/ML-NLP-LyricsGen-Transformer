Well help me mister fireman please
You know Im burnin from my head to my knees
Im aflame with such a burning desire
The little girl set my soul on fire
Shes got me burning up like a paper cup
I say mmmh Im on fire
Turn in full alarm
Im aflame from all of her charms
Oh little firebug cant you see
Cant you see what youre doin to me
Shes got me burning up like a paper cup
I say mmmh Im on fire
And when my babe kisses me
I start shakin like a ship on a stormy sea
And when I hear her say
Im gonna love you every minute of the day
I start to roast like toast ooh wee
