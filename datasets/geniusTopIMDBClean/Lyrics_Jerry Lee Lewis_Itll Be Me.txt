Well if you hear somebody knocking on your door
If you see something crawling across the floor
Baby itll be me and Ill be looking for you
If you see a head apeeping from a crawdad hole
If you see somebody climbing up a telephone pole
Baby itll be me and Ill be looking for you
Im gonna look on the mountain and in the deep blue sea
Gonna search all the forests and look and look in every tree
Well if you feel something heavy on your fishing hook
If you see a funny face in your comic book
Baby itll be me and Ill be looking for you
If you hear a thought calling out in the night
If you see somebody hanging from a lamp post bright
Baby itll be me and Ill be looking for you
Well if you see somebody looking in all the cars
If you see a rocket ship on its way to Mars
Baby itll be me and Ill be looking for you
Gonna look in the city where the lights are blue
Gonna search the countryside and all the haystacks too
Well if you see a new face on a totem pole
If you find a lump in your sugar bowl
Baby itll be me and Ill be looking for you
