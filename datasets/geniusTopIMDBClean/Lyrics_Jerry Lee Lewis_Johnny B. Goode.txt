Johnny B Goode LyricsYeah
Oh Johnny B Goode
Give it to me
Hes down in Lousiana close to New Orleans
Back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
Lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
He played the guitar like the aringin of a bell
Oh go go Johnny go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Ohoh Johnny B Goode
Yeah used to carry guitar in a gunny sack
Sittin neath the trees by the railroad track
Yold engineer would blow it on a lovely day
Strummin through the rhythm that the drivers made
People passin by they would stop and say
Oh that little country boy could play
Go go
Go Johnny go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Oh Johnny B Goode
Well his mama told him asomeday son you gonna be a man
Asay youre gonna be the leader of a big ol band
Many people coming from miles around
Thear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will in light
Johnny B Goode tonight

Go go go go Johnny go
Go go go go Johnny go
Go go go go Johnny go
Go go go go Johnny go
Go go go go
Ohho lord Johnny B Goode
Give it to me now
Oh ggo go Johnny go
Oh Johnny go go
Oh Johnny go go
Oh Johnny go go
Oh Johnny B Goode
Woo

Oh give it to me
Oh Johnny B Goode
