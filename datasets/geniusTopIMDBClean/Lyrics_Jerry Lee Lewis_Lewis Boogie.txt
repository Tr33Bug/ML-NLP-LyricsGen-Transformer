My name is Jerry Lee Lewis come from Louisiana
Im gonna do you a little boogie on this here piano
Doing mighty fine Im gonna make you shake it
Ill make you do it and make you do it until you break it
Its called the Lewis boogie in the Lewis way
Lord I do my little boogiewoogie every day
Well down in New Orleans the land of dreams
The best doggone place son you have ever seen
The cats go wild do a boogie thats hot
My boogiewoogie makes you want to stop and do the bop
Its called the Lewis boogie in the Lewis way
Lord I do my little boogiewoogie every day
Oh oh boy
Well now lets cruise on down to old Memphis town
Thats where that Presley boy said you aint nothing but a hound
But now you take my boogie it keeps you in the groove
Then your sacroiliac begins to shiver and a move
Its called the Lewis boogie in the Lewis way
Lord I do my little boogiewoogie every day
Oh boogiewoogie
When your hips start rockin
Honey and your knees start knockin
Lewis boogie Lewis way
Lord I do my little boogiewoogie every day
