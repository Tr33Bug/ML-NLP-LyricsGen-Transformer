If I look like a mean old man thats what I am
If I look like a mean old man thats what I am
If I look like a mean old man whod get you any way he can
Break your heart and kiss your hand
If I look like a mean old man thats what I am
If I look like a good old friend thats what I am
If I look like a good old friend thats what I am
If I look like a good old friend whos really bending with the wind
And be your friend right to the end thats what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll who takes his licking standing tall
Whod rather fight you back than crawl thats what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob thats what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob thats what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob like to slap me on the back and rock you
While he can still do the job thats what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll thats what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll who takes his licking standing tall
Whod rather fight you back than crawl thats what I am
