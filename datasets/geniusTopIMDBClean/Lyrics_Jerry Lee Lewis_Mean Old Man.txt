Mean Old Man LyricsIf I look like a mean old man that’s what I am
If I look like a mean old man that’s what I am
If I look like a mean old man who’d get you any way he can
Break your heart and kiss your hand
If I look like a mean old man that’s what I am
If I look like a good old friend that’s what I am
If I look like a good old friend that’s what I am
If I look like a good old friend who’s really bending with the wind
And be your friend right to the end that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll who takes his licking standing tall
Who’d rather fight you back than crawl that’s what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob that’s what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob that’s what I am
If I look like an Uncle Bob like to slap me on the back and rock you
While he can still do the job that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll that’s what I am
If I look like a voodoo doll who takes his licking standing tall
Who’d rather fight you back than crawl that’s what I amYou might also likeEmbed
