Oh they call me the meat man
Ya oughta see me eat mam
Hear Im the meat man baby
Ya oughta see me eat mam
I got jaws like a bear trap
Teeth like a razor
Got a Maytag tongue
With a sensitive taste
A born in Texas
A land of beef
Never cared much for greens
Ya oughta heard I like meat
Im the meat man
Woo oughta see me eat now
Whoa Im the meat man baby
Ya oughta see me eat now
I been down to Macon Georgia
I ate the furs off a Georgia peach
Plucked me a chicken in Memphis
Mama I still got feathers in my teeth
Ate a pound of pork Huntsville Alabama
From a fine Alabama hog
I went to Dallas Texas
Got no love my baby left me
Fed the bone to a Louisiana dog
Hear me talkin
A meat man
Woo meat man
Yeah Im a meat man baby
Ya oughta see me eat mam
Thats right
Think about it baby

Yeaeaeah it dont make me no difference
Just as long as its good meat
I aint got no preference
If its dog or rat I eat
It dont ahave to be US Governmental grade
With stamp ano Grade A seal
As long as it lean it fulla protein
Im gonna damn sho get my fill
Oh well they call me the
Meat meat meat meat meat
Meat meat meat meat man
Hey
