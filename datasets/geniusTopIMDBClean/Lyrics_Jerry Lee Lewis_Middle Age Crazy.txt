Today he traded his big 98 Oldsmobile
He got a heck of a deal
On a new Porsche car
He aint wearing his usual grey business suit
Hes got jeans and high boots
With an embroidered star
An today hes forty years old going on twenty
Dont look for the grey in his hair
Cause he aint got any
Hes got a young thing beside him
That just melts in his hand
Hes middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can
Hes gotta a woman hes loved for a long long time at home
Ah but the thrill is all gone
When they cut down the lights
Theyve got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb
But now the profits are high
But today hes forty years old going on twenty
And he hears of sordid affairs and he aint had any
And the young thing beside him
You know she understands
That hes middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can
