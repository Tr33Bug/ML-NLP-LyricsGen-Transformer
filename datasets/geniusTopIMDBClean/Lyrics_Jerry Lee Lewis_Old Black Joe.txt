Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay
Gone are the toils of the cotton fields away
Gone to the fields of a better land I know
I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe
Im coming Im coming
For my head is bending low
I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe
Im coming home  Im coming home 
Im coming home  Im coming home 
Ohoh my head is bending low
I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe
Old Black Joe Old Black Joe Old Black Joe
Why do I weep when my heart should feel no pain
Why do I sigh that my friends come not again
Grieving for forms now departed long ago
I hear their gentle voice calling Old Black Joe
Where are the hearts once so happy and free
The children so dear that I held upon my knee
Gone to the shore where my soul has longd to go
I hear their gentle voice calling Old Black Joe
