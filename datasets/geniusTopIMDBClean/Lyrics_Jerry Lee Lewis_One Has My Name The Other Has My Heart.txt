One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart) LyricsOne has my name, and the other has my heart
With one I'll remain, that's how my heartaches start
One has brown eyes, the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, to the other I am true
One has my love, and the other only me
But what, good is love, to an old heart that can't be free
So I'll go on living, my life just the same
While one has my heart, the other has my name
"Ah,one has my name , the other has my heart
With one I'll remain, ah that's how my old heartaches start
You know ones got brown eyes, and the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, to the other I guess I'll have to be true"
One that has my love, and the other only me
But what good is love, to a heart that can't be free
If I could live over, my life I would change
The one who has my heart, also would have my nameYou might also likeEmbed
