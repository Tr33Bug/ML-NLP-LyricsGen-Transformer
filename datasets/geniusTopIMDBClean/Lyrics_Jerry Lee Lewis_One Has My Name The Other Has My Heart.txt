One Has My Name  The Other Has My Heart  LyricsOne has my name and the other has my heart
With one Ill remain thats how my heartaches start
One has brown eyes the others eyes are blue
To one I am tied to the other I am true
One has my love and the other only me
But what good is love to an old heart that cant be free
So Ill go on living my life just the same
While one has my heart the other has my name
Ahone has my name  the other has my heart
With one Ill remain ah thats how my old heartaches start
You know ones got brown eyes and the others eyes are blue
To one I am tied to the other I guess Ill have to be true
One that has my love and the other only me
But what good is love to a heart that cant be free
If I could live over my life I would change
The one who has my heart also would have my name
