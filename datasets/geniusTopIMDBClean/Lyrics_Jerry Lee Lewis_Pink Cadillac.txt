You may think Im foolish for the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you when you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby you know you bug me aint no secret bout that
Well come on over here and hug me baby Ill show you where its at
Well honey it aint your money baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back oozing down the street
Waving to the girls feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Way back in the Bible temptation always comes along
Theres always somebody tempting somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple but man I aint going for that
Im going for the pink Cadillac crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back oozing down the street
Waving to the girls feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Yeah some folks say its a little too big and uses too much gas
Some folks say its too old it goes just a little too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda its bigger than a Subaru
Hey man theres only one thing and theres one car that will do
Anyway we dont have to drive it we can park it out in back
Have a party in your pink Cadillac crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back oozing down the street
Waving to the girls feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
