Shake, Rattle and Roll LyricsGet out in that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out in that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well roll my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you'll never do nothin'
To save your doggone soul
Wearin' those dresses your hair done up so nice
Wearin' those dresses your hair done up so nice
You look so warm but your heart is cold as ice
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you'll never do nothin'
To save your doggone soul
I'm like a one eyed cat peeping in a sea food store
I'm like a one eyed cat peeping in a sea food store
I can look at you tell you don't love me no more
I believe you are doing me wrong and now I know
I believe you are doing me wrong and now I know
The more I work the faster my money go
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll
Well you'll never do nothin'
To save your doggone soulYou might also likeEmbed
