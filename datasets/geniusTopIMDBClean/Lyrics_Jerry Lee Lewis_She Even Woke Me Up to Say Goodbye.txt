She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye LyricsMorning's come and, Lord, my mind is aching, yes it is
Sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn, my heart is silently breaking
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor
Once again the whole town will be talking, yes they will
Lord, I've seen the pity that's in their eyes
They could never understand
It's her sorrow, it's not a man
And no matter what they say, we know she tried
Baby's packed her soft things and she's left me, she's left me, she's left me
And I know she didn't mean to make me cry
It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
It's not her heart, Lord, it's her mind
She didn't mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
