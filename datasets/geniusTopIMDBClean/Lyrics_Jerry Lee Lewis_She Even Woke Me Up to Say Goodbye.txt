Mornings come and Lord my mind is aching yes it is
Sunshine standing quietly at my door
Just like the dawn my heart is silently breaking
With my tears it goes tumbling to the floor
Once again the whole town will be talking yes they will
Lord Ive seen the pity thats in their eyes
They could never understand
Its her sorrow its not a man
And no matter what they say we know she tried
Babys packed her soft things and shes left me shes left me shes left me
And I know she didnt mean to make me cry
Its not her heart Lord its her mind
She didnt mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
Its not her heart Lord its her mind
She didnt mean to be unkind
Why she even woke me up to say goodbye
Goodbye baby
