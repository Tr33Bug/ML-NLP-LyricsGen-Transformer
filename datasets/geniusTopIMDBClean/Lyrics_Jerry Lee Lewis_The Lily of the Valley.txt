I have found a friend in Jesus Hes everything to me
Hes the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
The lily of the valley and in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
In sorrow Hes my comfort in trouble Hes my stay
He tells me every care on Him to roll
Hes the lily of the valley Hes the bright and morning star
Hes the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows borne
In temptation Hes my strong and mighty tower
I have all for Him forsaken and all my idols torn
From my heart and now I know Hell keep me by His power
Though all the world forsake me and old Satan he tempts me sore
Through Jesus I shall safely reach that goal
Hes the lily of the valley Hes the bright and morning star
Hes the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
He will never never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
Its a wall of fire about me but Ive nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul is gonna fill
Then Ill go sweeping up to Glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
Hes the lily of the valley Hes the bright and morning star
Hes the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
