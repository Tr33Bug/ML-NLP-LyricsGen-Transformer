Too many miles behind me
Too many trials are through
Too many tears help me to remember
Theres too much to gain to lose
Too many sunsets that lie behind the mountains
Too many rivers my feet have walked through
Too many treasures awaiting over yonder
And theres too much to gain to lose
I crossed the hot burning desert
Just struggling the right road to choose
Somewhere up ahead theres cool clear water
And defeat is one word I never use
Too many sunsets that lie behind the mountains
Too many rivers my feet have walked through
Too many treasures awaiting over yonder
And theres too much to gain to lose
And theres too much to gain to lose
