Whole Lotta Shakinâ€™ Goin On Lyrics
Well, come on over baby
Whole lot of shakin' goin' on
I said come on over baby
Baby, you can't go wrong
We ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well, I said come on over baby
We got chicken in the barn, woo-a
Come on over baby
Really got the bull by the horn
We ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well, I said shake baby, shake it
I said shake baby, shake it
I said shake it baby, shake it
I said shake baby, shake
Come on over
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Ah, let's go



Come on over baby
We got chicken in the barn
Whose barn, what barn, my barn
Come on over baby really got the bull by the horn
We ain't fakin' whole lot of shakin' going on

Easy now
Shake
Well, shake it baby, yeah
You can shake one time for me
Come over baby
Whole lot of shakin' goin' on
You might also like
Now real low one time now
Shake baby shake
All you gotta do honey
Is kinda stand in one tight little spot
And wiggle around just a little bit
And that's when you got something yeah
Well you got to shake it for me
Now let's go one time

Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake, ooo
Come on baby
Shake, baby shake it
Come on over
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on1Embed
