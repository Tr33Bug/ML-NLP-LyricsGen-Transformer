$20 Fine Lyrics
One more day feelin' this way
Walkin' through it anyway
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
Can't seem to believe the truth that's mine

But I know my time is comin'
Everything we want is just around the corner, honey
Carry it all
Witness a world that's whirlin'
Take some time and ﬁnd out who we are
Oh, yes, who we are
One more dream, one more scheme
Life just isn't what it seems
One more day, heavy dues to pay
Hope someone'll give it back to me someday

And I know my time is comin'
Everything we want is just around the corner, honey
Carry it all
Witness a world that's whirlin'
Got to take some time and ﬁnd out who we are
Ah yeah, ﬁnd out

One more time walkin' the line
Pay a twenty dollar line
Don't let the man get too out of hand
If he hits you in the head, you're gonna wish you ran

And I know our time is comin‘
Everything we want is just around the corner
Carry it all
Witness a world that‘s whirlin‘
Got to take some time and ﬁnd out who we are
You might also like
One more time walkin' the line
Pay a thirty dollar ﬁne
Hope that the man don't get out of hand
Punchin‘ the lip of truth at night

But I know our time is comin'
Everything we want is just around the corner, honey
Carry it allEmbed
