One more day feelin this way
Walkin through it anyway
Feel like Im losin my mind
Cant seem to believe the truth thats mine
But I know my time is comin
Everything we want is just around the corner honey
Carry it all
Witness a world thats whirlin
Take some time and nd out who we are
Oh yes who we are
One more dream one more scheme
Life just isnt what it seems
One more day heavy dues to pay
Hope someonell give it back to me someday
And I know my time is comin
Everything we want is just around the corner honey
Carry it all
Witness a world thats whirlin
Got to take some time and nd out who we are
Ah yeah nd out
One more time walkin the line
Pay a twenty dollar line
Dont let the man get too out of hand
If he hits you in the head youre gonna wish you ran
And I know our time is comin
Everything we want is just around the corner
Carry it all
Witness a world thats whirlin
Got to take some time and nd out who we are
One more time walkin the line
Pay a thirty dollar ne
Hope that the man dont get out of hand
Punchin the lip of truth at night
But I know our time is comin
Everything we want is just around the corner honey
Carry it all
