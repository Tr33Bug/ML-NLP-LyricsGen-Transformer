For fifty years theyve been married
And they cant wait for their fiftyfirst to roll around
Yeah roll around
Thirty years theyve been married
And now theyre old and happy and they settle down
Settle down yeah
Twenty years theyve been married
And they did everything that could be done
You know theyre having fun
And then you come along and talk about
So you you say you wanna be married
Im gonna change your mind
Oh Got to change
That was the good side baby
Here comes the bad side
Ten years theyve been married
A thousand kids run around hungry
Cause their mothers a louse
Daddys down at the whiskey house
That aint all
For three years theyve been married
They dont get along so good
Theyre tired of each other you know how that goes
She got another lover same old thing
So now youre seventeen
Running around hanging out and having your fun
Life for you has just begun baby
And then you come saying
So you you say you want to be married
Oh baby trying to put me on a chain
Aint that some shame
You must be losing your weak little mind
I aint ready yet baby I aint ready
Im gonna change your mind
Oh look out baby


Ow
I aint ready to get tied down
I aint ready
I aint ready now
Let me live a little while longer
Let me live
Let me live a little while longer oh
So if youre finished talking
Let me get back in my groove
