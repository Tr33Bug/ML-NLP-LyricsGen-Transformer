51st Anniversary Lyrics
For fifty years they've been married
And they can't wait for their fifty-first to roll around
Yeah, roll around
Thirty years they've been married
And now they're old and happy and they settle down
Settle down, yeah
Twenty years they've been married
And they did everything that could be done
You know they're having fun
And then you come along and talk about
So you, you say you wanna be married
I'm gonna change your mind
Oh! Got to change
That was the good side, baby
Here comes the bad side
Ten years they've been married
A thousand kids run around hungry
'Cause their mother's a louse
Daddy's down at the whiskey house
That ain't all
For three years they've been married
They don't get along so good
They're tired of each other, you know how that goes
She got another lover, same old thing
So now you're seventeen
Running around, hanging out, and having your fun
Life for you has just begun, baby
And then you come saying
So you, you say you want to be married
Oh baby, trying to put me on a chain
Ain't that some shame?
You must be losing your, weak little mind
I ain't ready yet, baby, I ain't ready
I'm gonna change your mind!
Oh, look out, baby
You might also like
Ow!
I ain't ready to get tied down
I ain't ready
I ain't ready now
Let me live a little while longer
Let me live!
Let me live a little while longer, oh
So if you're finished talking
Let me get back in my groove1Embed
