Here I come to save the day
A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from Heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
It said Get out there man and ado your best
Uh
They call him Astro Man
And he is flying higher than
That old faggot superman
Ever could
Oh they call him Cosmic Nut
And hes twice as dense as Donald duck
And he will try his best to screw you up
The rest of your mind
Oh look out my guitars
Astro man
Flying across the sky
Ten times higher
Then that old faggot superman
Ever ever could
Ever could
There he goes there he goes
Where he stops No one knows
There he goes there he goes uh
He is trying to trying to blow out the rest of your mind
Hes going to blow out the rest of your mind
Talking about looking for peace of mind
Astro man will leave it in pieces
Have you put our trouble behind him
Make you fly around in pieces
Yeah blow out the rest of your mind
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind
Hes going to blow out the rest of your mind
Wuhu yeah
Yeahyeahyeahyeah
Blow out the rest of your mind
