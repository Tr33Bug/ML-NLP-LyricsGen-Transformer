Well Im up here in this womb
Im looking all around
Well I am looking out my belly button window
And I see a whole lot of frowns
And I am wondering if they dont want me around
What seems to be the fuss out there
Just what seems to be the hang
Because you know if you just do not want me this time around
Yeah I will be glad to go back to spirit land
And even take a longer rest
Before I am coming down the chute again
Man I sure remember the last time baby
They were still hawking about me then
So if you dont want me now
Make up your mind where or when
If you dont want me now
Give or take you only got two hundred days
Because I aint coming down this way too much more again
You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think you are just a little too late
So Im coming down into this world daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And Im going to sit up in your bed mama
And just grin right in your face
And then Im going to eat up all your chocolates
And say I hope Im not too late
So if there is any questions
Make up your mind
Because you better give or take
Questions in your mind
Give it or take
You only got two hundred days
Well Im up here in this womb
Looking all around sure is dark in here
Im looking out my belly button window
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
And Im wondering if they want me around
