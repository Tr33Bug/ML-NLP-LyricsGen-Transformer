Well I wish I was a catfish
Swimming in Lord the deep blue sea
Id have all you pretty women
Fishing after me fishing after me
Fishing after me yeah
Ohh yeah ohh yeah ohh yeah ohh yeah
When I went down my girlfriends house
And I sat down Lord on her front step
And she said Come in now Jimi
My husband just now left just now left
Ohh yeah ohh yeah ohh yeah ohh yeah
Well theres two two trains running
But theres not one Lord thats going my way
You know theres a one train running at midnight
Other ones leave just for a day
Leave just for a day
Ohh yeah ohh yeah ohh yeah ohh yeah
