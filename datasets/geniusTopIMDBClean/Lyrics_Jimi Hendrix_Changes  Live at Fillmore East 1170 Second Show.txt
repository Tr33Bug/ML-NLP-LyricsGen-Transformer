Buddy Miles is going to do this thing he wrote
Called Them Changes
Well my mind is going through them changes
I feel just like Im in the time
Every time you see me going some where
I feel like Im going out of my mind yeah
Oh my baby she left me the other day
And we were having so much fun yeah yeah
Oh my baby she stepped out on me
And thats the reason why she had to part
Its alright yeah yeah

Well my mind is going through them changes
I think Im going out of my mind
Every time you see me going some where
I think I could commit a crime know
She had me running

She had me running
