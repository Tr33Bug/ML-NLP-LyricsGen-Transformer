Well I see hands and I see tearstained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land
Well I taste tears and the precious years wasted
Saying Lord please send us a helping hand
Lord Lord Lord 
On the mountain stands a woman
Lord Lord Lord 
Hey I feel her shining light
Lord Lord Lord 
Lord must be the answer
Lord Lord Lord 
Thank you Lord and keep her alright
Got them earth blues today
I hear the thunder of freedoms beating heart
Sirens clashing with black earth and rocking stone
I think you better love me now darling it just might be too late after a while
And tell our child to bury old daddys broken clothes
Lord Lord Lord 
Hey I see a beautiful woman
Lord Lord Lord 
Yes and I feel her shining light on me
Lord Lord Lord 
Lord Must be the answer
Lord Lord Lord 
Help me Lord and keep her alright for me
Help me darling 
Help me darling
Help me darling 
To keep the light
Help me darling 
Everything alright
Help me darling 
Keep shining bright
Help me darling 
Help me darling
Help me darling 
Help me darling
Help me darling 
Ooh
Help me darling 
Got those earth blues today
Lord Lord Lord 
Oooh
Lord Lord Lord 
Yeah but uh sometimes my imagination grabs me by surprise
A queen of ebony in chains I visualize
And back on the moon I see her portrait in a tomb
And these words are written first woman from Gods womb
Lord Lord Lord 
Hey Stands a woman
Lord Lord Lord 
And I feel her shining light
Lord Lord Lord 
Lord must be the answer
Lord Lord Lord 
Thank you Lord and keep her alright
Yeah
I think Ill be alright with my baby now
Shake these earth blues away from me baby
