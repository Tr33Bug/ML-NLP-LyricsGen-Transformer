There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Ridin down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Tryin to find his heaven above
But hes dyin to be loved dyin to be loved
Hes tellin me livin
Is so magic
Something is forever
So he claims
Hes talkin bout lyin
Its so tragic baby
But dont you worry bout today
We got freedom comin our way freedoms comin our way
How long
Do you
Think he is gonna last
Carryin on outta gas
See all the others say
Do what you please
Gotta get the brothers together
And the right to be free
In a cloud of angel dust
I think I see me a freak
Hey motorcycle mama
You gonna marry me
Bridge
Ill be stone crazy
Love comin in at you
Stone crazy baby
There goes Ezy
Ezy Ryder
Ridin down the highway of desire
He says the free wind
Takes him higher
Searching for his heaven above
But hes dyin to be loved dyin to be loved
