Freedom LyricsYou got my pride
Hangin' out of my bed
You messing with my life
So I bought my lead
You even messin' with my children
And you're screaming at my wife, baby
Get off of my back
If you wanna get outta here alive
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) That's what I want now
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) That's what I need now
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) To live
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) So I can give
You got my heart
Spittin' electric water
You got my soul
Screamin' and holl'rin'
You bout to hook my girlfriend
You know the drugstore man
But I don't need it now
Unless you're trying to slap it out of her hand
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) So I can live
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) So I can give
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) Yeah
(Freedom) Freedom!
(Give it to me) That's what I need
You don't have to
Say that you love me
If you don't mean it
You better believe
If you need me
Or you just want to bleed me
 Better sticking your dagger in someone else
So I can leave
Set me free!
