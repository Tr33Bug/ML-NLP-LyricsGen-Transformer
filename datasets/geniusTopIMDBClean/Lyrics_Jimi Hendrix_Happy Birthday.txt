Everybodys wishing me a happy birthday
Everybodys wishing you a real good time
Everybodys wishing me a happy birthday
Everybodys wishing me a real good time
A phone call my telephone
I can tell I have some mail
Everybodys wishing me a happy birthday
Everybodys wishing wishing me well
As a year comes around
When it comes some people fall
But Im happy
Everybodys wishing me a happy birthday
Everybodys wishing you a real good time
Everybodys wishing me a happy birthday
Everybodys wishing me a real good time
A phone call my telephone
I can tell I have some mail
Everybodys wishing me a happy birhtday
Everybodys wishing me a real good time
A phone call my telephone
I can tell I have some mail
Everybodys wishing me a happy birhtday
Everybodys wishing wishing me well
