Hey gypsy boy
Where do you come from
From the land  of the  new rising sun
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to
Im going to spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind too
Lord may I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to
Im going to spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind too
Lord may I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
