Well I I just came back today
I just came back from the storm
Yeah
I said I just came back baby
I just came back from the storm
Yeah from the storm
Well I did not know it then
But I was suffering suffering
For my love to keep me warm
It was so cold and lonely yeah
The wind and crying blue rain
Were tearing me up
I want to thank you my sweet darling
For digging in the mud and picking me up
Thank you so much
It was a crying blue rain the burning my eyes
The wind and lightning struck by suprise
It was you my love who brought me in
I love you so much
Ill never stray from you again
Hey
I just came back today
I just came back to get my baby on her way
Yeah yeah
