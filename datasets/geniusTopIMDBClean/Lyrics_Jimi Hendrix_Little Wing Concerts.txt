Little Wing  LyricsWell shes walking
Through the clouds
With a circus mind
Thats running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairy tales
Thats all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind
When Im sad
She comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free
Its alright she says its alright
Take anything you want from me anything
Anything
Fly on little wing
