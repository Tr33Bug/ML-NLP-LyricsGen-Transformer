Little Wing  LyricsWell, she's walking
Through the clouds
With a circus mind
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind
When I'm sad
She comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free
It's alright, she says, it's alright
Take anything you want from me, anything
Anything
Fly on, little wingYou might also likeEmbed
