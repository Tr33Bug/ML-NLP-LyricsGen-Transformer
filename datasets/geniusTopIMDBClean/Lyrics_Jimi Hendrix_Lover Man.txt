Here he comes baby
Here comes your lover man
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
Ill sneak out your window babe
I really gotta go as fast as I can
Reach down baby
And get on my running shoes
Reach down baby
And get on my running shoes
See your man coming
Babe Ive got no time to lose
I wanna love you longer baby
I wanna love you stronger stronger
But I wanna love you all night longer
But thats your man way over yonder now
