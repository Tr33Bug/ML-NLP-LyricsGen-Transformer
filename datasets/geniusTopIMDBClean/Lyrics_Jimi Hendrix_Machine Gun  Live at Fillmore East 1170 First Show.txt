Machine Gun  Live at Fillmore East 1170  Lyrics
Happy New Year first of all
I hope we have about a million or two million more of them
If we can get over this summer hehehe
Id like to dedicate this one to uh
The draggy scene thats going on
All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York
Oh yes and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam
Id like to do a thing called Machine Gun
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Evil man make me kill you
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though were only families apart
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
You know what I mean
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground
The same way you shoot me down baby
Youll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun
I aint afraid of your mess no more babe
I aint afraid no more
After awhile your your cheap talk wont even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Because I know all the time youre wrong baby
And youll be going just the same


Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart
Dont you shoot him down
Hes about to leave here
Dont you shoot him down
Hes got to stay here
He aint going nowhere
Hes been shot down to the ground
Oh where he cant survive no no
Yeah thats what we dont want to hear anymore alright
No bullets 
At least here huh huh
No guns no bombs 
Huh huh
No nothing just lets all live and live
You know instead of killing
