Machine Gun  Lyrics
Happy new year first of all I hope well have million or two million more of them if we can get over this summer ha ha ha Id like to dedicate this one to the draggin scene thats goin on All the soldiers that are fightin in Chicago Milwaukee and New York Oh yes and all the soldiers fightin in Vietnam Id like to do a thing called Machine Gun
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Evil man make me kill ya
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though were only families apart
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
You know what I mean 
Hey and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah but you still blast me down to the ground
The same way you shoot me down baby
Youll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey machine gun
I aint afraid of your mess no more babe
I aint afraid no more
After a while your cheap talk dont even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Cause I know all the time youre wrong baby
And youll be goin just the same
Yeah machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah yeah alright
Tearing my family apart
Dont you shoot him down
Hes about to leave here
Dont you shoot him down
Hes got to stay here
He aint going nowhere
Hes been shot down to the ground
Where he cant survive no no
Yeah thats what we dont wanna hear any more alright
No bullets
At least here huh huh
No guns no bombs
