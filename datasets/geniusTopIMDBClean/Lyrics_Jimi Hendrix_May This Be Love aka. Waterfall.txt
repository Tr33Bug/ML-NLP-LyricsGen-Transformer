May This Be Love  aka Waterfall  LyricsWaterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall
I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall
Some people say
Daydreamings for all the
Lazy minded fools
With nothin else to do
So let them laugh laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
Ive got nothing to lose
Long as I have you
Waterfall
Dont ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh my waterfall
