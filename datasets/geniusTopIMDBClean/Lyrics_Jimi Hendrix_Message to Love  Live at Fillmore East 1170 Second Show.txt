Message to Love  Live at Fillmore East 1170  Lyrics
Jimis gonna do a thing that he he wrote called Message of Love
Well I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I send a message of love
Dont you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today
Well I am what I am thank God
Some people just dont understand what Im about
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Dont you be no fool
Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin with that fool baby
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come on along with me
Dont mess with your man
Hell never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
And then prove to the man
Youre as strong as him
Cause in the eyes of God
Youre both chewin it to him


Everybody come alive
Everybody love all night
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message
