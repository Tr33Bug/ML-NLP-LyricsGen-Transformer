Hey look out for my glass up there man
Thats my drink man thats my drink alright
Make it a double or eh
Somebody has to sing
Some body will sing
Somebody will sing right
I dont know
You all pass me that bottle
And Ill sing you all a real song
Yeah
Let me get my key ahem
Well Im looking through Harlem
My stomach squeal just a little more
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints
Pulls up to soap box door
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
Tied to the drivers fence
Breathes in my face
Bourbon and coke possessed words
Havent I seen you somewhere in hell
Or was it just an accident
You know how I felt then and so 
Before I could ask Was it the East or West side
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
And as they pulled away I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
Well I picked them up brushed them off
To see what they say
And you wouldnt believe
Come around to my room with the tooth in the middle
And bring along the bottle and a president
And eh sometimes its not so easy baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks sees looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
Gets very lonely up this road baby 
Yeah hmmm yeah 
Got more to say 
Well Im riding through LA  huh 
On a bicycle built for a fool
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say You dont look the way you usually do
I say Well some people look like a coinbox
He says Looks like you have got no coins to spare
And I laid back and I thought to myself and I said this
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone
And combed this breath right out of my hair
And eh sometimes its not so easy
Especially when your only friend
Talks sees looks and feels like you
And you do just the same as him
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail
And Im on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror
To make sure my friends here with me too
And you know good well I dont drink coffee
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Cherry lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacks me from his pillbox ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man my shadow comes in line before you
Im finding out that its not so easy baby
Especially when your only friend
Talks sees looks and feels like you
And you do the same just like him
Lord its so lonely here hmmm yeah 
Yeah
Pass me that bottle over there 
Yeah yeah okay
