Night Bird Flying Lyrics
She's just a night bird flyin' through the night
Fly on
She's just a night bird makin' a midnight, midnight flight
Sail on, sail on
Well, she's flying down to me
But, 'til tomorrow got to set her free
Set her free

So all we got, baby, is one precious night
All we got is one precious night
Throw all your blues and shoes and things
And rags down under the bed
Just wrap me up in your beautiful wings
Better hear what I say, yeah
Oh, carry me home
Please take me through your dreams
Inside your world I want to be
Until tomorrow no tears will be shed
Hold on 'til the sun gets out of bed
Hold on, hold on, baby
Fly on
Sail on, sail on , sail on
Sail onYou might also like2Embed
