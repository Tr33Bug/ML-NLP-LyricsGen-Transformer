Purple Haze  original mix  LyricsPurple haze all in my brain
Lately things dont seem the same
Actin funny but I dont know why
Scuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
Dont know if Im comin up or down
Am I happy or in misery
Whatever it is that girl put a spell on me
Help me
Help me
Oh no no
Hammerin
Talkin bout heart n ssoul
Im talkin about hard stuff
If everybodys still around fluff and ease if
So far out my mind
Somethings happening somethings happening
Ooo ahhh
Ooo ahhh
Ooo ahhh
Ooo ahhh yeah
Purple haze all in my eyes uhh
Dont know if its day or night
You got me blowin blowin my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time
Ooh

Ahh yeayeah purple haze yeah
Oh no oh

Tell me baby tell me
I cant go on like this
Youre makin me blow my mind mama
Nno nooo
