Red House  live  LyricsTheres a Red House over yonder
Thats where my baby stays
Theres a Red House over yonder baby
Thats where my baby stays
Well I aint been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days
Bout time I see her
Wait a minute somethings wrong here
The key wont unlock the door
Wait a minute somethings wrong baby
Lord have mercy this key wont unlock this door
Somethings goin on here
I have a bad bad feeling that my baby dont live here no more
Thats all right I still got my guitar
Look out now
I might as well go on back down
Go back cross yonder over the hill
I might as well go back over yonder
Way back over yonder cross the hill
Thats where I came from
Cause if my baby dont love me no more
I know her sister will
