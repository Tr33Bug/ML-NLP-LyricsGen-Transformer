Room Full of Mirrors Lyrics
I used to live in a room full of mirrors
All I could see was me
Well, I take my spirit and I smash my mirrors
Now the whole world is here for me to see
I said the whole world is here for me to see
Now I am searching for my love to be
Hey!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Cotton screaming crying in my head
Rubber glass was all in my brain
Just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
And just the thought of my dreams cut me in my bed
I said making love was strange in my bed

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All right
Ooh ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No place stumping
No place far
Can't find the floor
Nowhere at all
See nothing but sunshine
All around

Love come shining over the mountains
Love come shining over the sea
Love will shine on my baby
Then I'll know who's exactly for me
Lord, I'll know who will be for me
In the meantime, which is a groovy timeYou might also like2Embed
