Send my love to you
Im sending all my love to you
Send my love to Linda
She lit a fire way down inside
She made the sun shine in my eye
God let me hold her once more before I die
Sending my love to you
Sending my love to you
Sending my love to you
Send it to Linda
She lit a fire way down inside
She made the sun shine in my eye
God let me hold her once more before I die
