Oh uh
I see fingers hands and shades of faces
Reaching up and not quite touching the promised land
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper saying
Oh Lord please give us a helping hand
Yeah yeah
Way down in the background
I can see frustrated souls of cities burning
And all across the water vapor
I see weapons barking out the stamp of death
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFOs jumping themselves
Laughing they saying
Those people so uptight they sure know how to make a mess
Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink
I cant really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor
But as far as I know
They may even try to wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me and dont worry about looking at the storm
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
