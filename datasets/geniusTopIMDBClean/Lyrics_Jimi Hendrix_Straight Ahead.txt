Hello my friend
So happy to see you again
I was so alone
All by myself i just couldnt make it
Have you heard baby
What the winds blowin round
Have you heard baby
A whole lot a peoples coming right on down
Communication yeah is coming on strong
I dont give a damn baby
If your hair is short or long
I said get out of your grave
Oh everybody is dancing in the street
Do what you know
Do not be slow
You got to practice what you preach
Yeah because it is time for you and me
Come to face reality
Forget about the past baby
Things aint what they used to be
Keep on straight ahead
Keep on straight ahead
Straight ahead baby
Straight ahead baby
Whoo
We got to stand side by side
We got to stand together and organize
Send power to the people thats what theyre screaming
Freedom of the soul
Pass it on pass it on to the young and the old

You got to tell the children the truth
They dont need a whole lot of lies
Because one of these days baby
Theyll be running things
So when you give them love
You better give it right
Woman and child man and wife
The best love to have is the Love Of Life
Hello my friend
Its so good to see you again
Hey now Ive been all by myself
I dont think I can make it alone
