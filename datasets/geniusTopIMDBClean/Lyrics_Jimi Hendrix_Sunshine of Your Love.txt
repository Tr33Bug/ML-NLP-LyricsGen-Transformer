Its getting near dawn
When lights close their tired eyes
Ill soon be with you my love
To give you my dawn surprise
Ill be with you darling soon
Ill be with you when the stars start falling
Ive been waiting so long
To be where Im going
In the sunshine of your love
Im with you my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes Im with you my love
Its the morning and just we two
Ill stay with you darling now
Ill stay with you till my seas are dried up
Ive been waiting so long
To be where Im going
In the sunshine of your love
Ive been waiting so long
To be where Im going
In the sunshine of your love
Im with you my love
The lights shining through on you
Yes Im with you my love
Its the morning and just we two
Ill stay with you darling now
Ill stay with you till my seas are dried up
Ive been waiting so long
Ive been waiting so long
Ive been waiting so long
To be where Im going
In the sunshine of your love
