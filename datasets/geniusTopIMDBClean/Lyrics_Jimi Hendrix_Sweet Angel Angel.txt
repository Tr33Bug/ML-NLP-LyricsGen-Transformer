Sweet Angel  Angel  Lyrics
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow
And I said Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow Im going to be by your side
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the childs sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand you are going to be my man
You are going to rise
And then she took me high over yonder
And I said Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side
