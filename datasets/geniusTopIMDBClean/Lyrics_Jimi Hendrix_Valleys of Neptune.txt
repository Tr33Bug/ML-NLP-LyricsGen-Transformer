Lord I feel the ocean swaying me
Washing away all my pain
See where I used to be wounded
Remember the scar
Now you cant see a thing
And I dont feel no pain no no
Singing about the Valleys of Sunrise
Green and blue canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is rising rising rising
Mercury liquid emeralds shining
Now showing me where I came from baby
Honey sun turquoise bed he lays in
On the burning edge horizon
Im sailing on a bluebirds mission
Bubbles and curls and tiptoes in the foam
See the wind make love to all the ocean
Tidal waves spread and the message got home
And the message got home
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Purple and gold the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt there were moon trips
The Valleys of Neptune is arising 
Look out east coast but youre going to have a neighbor
A rebirth land home of the praying hands
We know there were kinds so much older
And they shall rise and tell us much more the truth of man
I see visions of sleeping peaks erupting
Releasing all hell that will shake the Earth from end to end
And this isnt bad news good news or any news
Its just the truth better save your souls while you can
Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be
Singing about getting ready for the new tide
The Valleys of Neptune is arising
