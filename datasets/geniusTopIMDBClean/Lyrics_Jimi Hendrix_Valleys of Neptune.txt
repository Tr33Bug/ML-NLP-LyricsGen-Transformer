Valleys of Neptune Lyrics
Lord, I feel the ocean swaying me
Washing away all my pain
See where I used to be wounded
Remember the scar?
Now you can't see a thing
And I don't feel no pain, no, no

Singing about the Valleys of Sunrise
Green and blue canyons, too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is rising, rising, rising
Mercury liquid, emerald's shining
Now showing me where I came from, baby
Honey sun, turquoise bed he lays in
On the burning edge horizon
I'm sailing on a bluebird's mission
Bubbles and curls and tiptoes in the foam
See the wind make love to all the ocean
Tidal waves spread, and the message got home
And the message got home

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets...
Purple and gold... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising -

Look out east coast, but you're going to have a neighbor
A rebirth land, home of the praying handsâ€‹
We know there were kinds, so much older
And they shall rise, and tell us much more the truth of man
I see visions of sleeping peaks erupting
Releasing all hell that will shake the Earth from end to end

And this isn't bad news, good news, or any news
It's just the truth, better save your souls while you can

Of the Sunrise... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide...
The Valleys of Neptune is arisingEmbed
