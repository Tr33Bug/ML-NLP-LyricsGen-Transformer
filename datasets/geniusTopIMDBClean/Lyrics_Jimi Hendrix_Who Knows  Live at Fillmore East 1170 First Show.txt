Who Knows  Live at Fillmore East 1170  Lyrics
The Fillmore is proud to welcome back some old friends with a brand new name a Band of Gypsys
They dont know
They dont know 
Like I know
Like I know 
Do you know
They dont know 
I dont know
I dont know 
What my baby
About my baby 
Is putting down
Putting down 
What my babys
Oh my baby 
Putting down baby
Putting down now 
I just came back from
I dont know 
Mexicali

I just came back in town
They dont know 
Looking for my Sally
I dont know my baby 
Have you seen her
Running free yeah 
Have you seen her
Oooh hoo 
Talkin about my baby
Goin down 
Talkin about my baby
I just came in
I just came in baby
I just came in

Spreading magic honey
All in my bed
She got chains attached to my head
Talkin about
Talkin about
Talkin about my baby
I dont know her
They dont know what I know
They dont know like I know
All the time been hangin around
All the time I hang around

And she go walkin down the street singin

Etc  scat singing 
They dont know
Nobody knows
