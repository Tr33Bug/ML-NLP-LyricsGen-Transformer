Well theyre building a gallows outside my cell
And Ive got 25 minutes to go
And the whole towns waiting just to hear me yell
I got 24 minutes to go
Well they gave me some beans for my last meal
With 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go
Well I sent for the Governor and the whole dern bunch
With 21 minutes to go
And I called up the mayor but hes out to lunch
I got 20 more minutes to go
Then the sheriff said boy Im gonna watch you die
With 19 minutes to go
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
With 18 minutes to go
Now here comes the preacher for to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And hes talking about burning but Im so cold
12 more minutes to go
Now theyre testing the trap and it chills my spine
11 more minutes to go
And the trap and the rope aw they work just fine
With 10 more minutes to go
Well Im waiting on the pardon thatll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this aint the movies so forget about me
With 8 more minutes to go
With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose
5 more minutes to go
Wont somebody come and cut me loose
7 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains I can see the skies
With 3 more minutes to go
And its too dern pretty for a man that dont want to die
With 2 more minutes to go
I can see the buzzards I can hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now Im swinging and here I goooooooooo
