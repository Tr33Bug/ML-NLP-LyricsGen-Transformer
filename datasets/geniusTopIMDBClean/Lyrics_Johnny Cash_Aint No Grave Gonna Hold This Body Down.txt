Aint No Grave  Gonna Hold This Body Down  Lyrics
There aint no grave
Can hold my body down
There aint no grave
Can hold my body down
When I hear that trumpet sound
Im going to rise right out of the ground
Aint no grave
Can hold my body down
Well look way down the river
And what do you think I see
I see a band of angels
And theyre coming after me
Aint no grave
Can hold my body down
There aint no grave
Can hold my body down
Well look down yonder Gabriel
Put your feet on the land and sea
But Gabriel dont you blow your trumpet
Until you hear from me
There aint no grave
Can hold my body down
Aint no grave
Can hold my body down
Well meet me Jesus meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings dont fail me
I will meet you anywhere
Aint no grave
Can hold my body down
There aint no grave
Can hold my body down
Well meet me Mother and Father
Meet me down the river road
And Mama you know that Ill be there
When I check in my load
Aint no grave
Can hold my body down
There aint no grave
Can hold my body down
There aint no grave
Can hold my body down
