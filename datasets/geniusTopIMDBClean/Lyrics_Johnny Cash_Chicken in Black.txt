For two long years my head hurt bad
So the doctor checked me and he shook his head
He said Im sorry to tell you but your bodys outlived your brain
He said I know this doctor in New York son
And hell fix you up right with a brand new one
So the head doctor met me when I stepped down off the train
He said We had this bank robber killed last night
His bodys shot but his brains alright
Ill give you a transplant boy and itll be okay
I got my new brain in and I was feeling great
I went right back to Nashville with no headache
But something strange happened when I walked in the bank one day
I said Stick em up everybody Im robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Dont nobody move and dont nobody reach for that door
A lady said Why youre Johnny Cash
I said No maam Im the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York
Now the other night Roy Acuff called me
He said John Id like for you to do the Opry
So I went out on the stage but I couldnt sing
I got into half a verse of I Walk The Line
And something snapped in that head of mine
I yelled Stick em up Gimme your money your watches and rings
Well I called New York and talked to that brain quack
I said Doc Ive got to have my old brain back
He said Im sorry there Mr Cash but I cant do that
He said I put your brain in a chicken last Monday
He singing your songs and making lots of money
And I got him signed to a ten year recording contract
Now friends if you see me walking down the street
Remember what you see aint necessarily me
And if I try to hold you up dont pay me no mind
But when you got ten bucks that you can blow
You ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
Hes doin fairs and concert dates all up and down the line
I said Stick em up everybody Im robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Dont nobody move and dont nobody reach for that door
A lady said Why youre Johnny Cash
I said No maam Im the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York
Well I dont pay any income tax
You dont pay tax on money you steal
But you ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
Chicken In Black
Mm
