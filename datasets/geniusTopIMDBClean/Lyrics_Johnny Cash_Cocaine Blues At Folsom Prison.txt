Cocaine Blues  At Folsom Prison  Lyrics
Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Laid in the hot joints taking the pills
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
Youre the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If youve got a warrant just aread it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next morning bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff coming down the line
Hocked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said Come on you dirty hack into that district court
Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read In the first degree
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninetynine years in the Folsom Pen
Ninetynine years underneath that ground
I cant forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come all youve got to listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be


These men have receptions
Matlock A50632 and Batshelter A39879
They have receptions
Is that gonna be on the album
Yeah
I doubt that
