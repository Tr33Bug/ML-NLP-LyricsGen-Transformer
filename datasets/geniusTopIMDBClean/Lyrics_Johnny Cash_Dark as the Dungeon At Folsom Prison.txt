Dark as the Dungeon  At Folsom Prison  LyricsOh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
Itll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Until the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
Its dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
Well its many a man that Ive seen in my day
Ha ha no laughing during this song please Its being recorded I know Hell dont you know its being recorded 
Like a friend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when Im dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then Ill look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew
Danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
Its dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
Thank you very much thank you very much Im sorry about that little interruption there but I just want to tell you that this show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records and you cant say hell or shit or anything like that Hows that grab you Bob
