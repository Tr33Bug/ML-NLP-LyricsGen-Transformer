Five Feet High and Rising Lyrics
How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Two feet high and rising

We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and rising
How high's the water, mama?
Three feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Three feet high and rising

Well, the hives are gone
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleeping
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees
Three feet high and rising

How high's the water, mama?
Four feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Four feet high and rising

Hey, come look through the window pane
The bus is coming, it's going to take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain
Four feet high and rising
You might also like
How high's the water, mama?
Five feet high and rising
How high's the water, papa?
Five feet high and rising

Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We got to head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and rising
Well its five feet high and rising2Embed
