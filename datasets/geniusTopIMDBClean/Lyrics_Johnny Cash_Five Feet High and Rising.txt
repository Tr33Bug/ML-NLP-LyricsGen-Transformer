How highs the water mama
Two feet high and rising
How highs the water papa
Two feet high and rising
We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
Thats the only thing we got left thatll float
Its already over all the wheat and the oats
Two feet high and rising
How highs the water mama
Three feet high and rising
How highs the water papa
Three feet high and rising
Well the hives are gone
Ive lost my bees
The chickens are sleeping
In the willow trees
Cows in water up past her knees
Three feet high and rising
How highs the water mama
Four feet high and rising
How highs the water papa
Four feet high and rising
Hey come look through the window pane
The bus is coming its going to take us to the train
Looks like well be blessed with a little more rain
Four feet high and rising
How highs the water mama
Five feet high and rising
How highs the water papa
Five feet high and rising
Well the rails are washed out north of town
We got to head for higher ground
We cant come back till the water comes down
Five feet high and rising
Well its five feet high and rising
