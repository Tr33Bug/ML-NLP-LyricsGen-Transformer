I hear the train acomin its rolling round the bend
And I aint seen the sunshine since I dont know when
Im stuck in Folsom prison and time keeps draggin on
But that train keeps arollin on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me Son
Always be a good boy dont ever play with guns
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin I hang my head and cry
I bet theres rich folks eatin in a fancy dining car
Theyre probably drinkin coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming I know I cant be free
But those people keep amovin and thats what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine
I bet Id move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison thats where I want to stay
And Id let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
