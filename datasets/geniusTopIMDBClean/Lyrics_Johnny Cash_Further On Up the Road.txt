Further On  Up the Road  Lyrics
Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
Where the gun is cocked and the bullets cold
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
Ill meet you further on up the road
Got on my dead mans suit and my smilin skull ring
My lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing
I got a song to sing it keeps me out of the cold
And Ill meet you further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Where the way is dark and the night is cold
One sunny mornin well rise I know
And Ill meet you further on up the road
Now I been out in the desert just doin my time
Searchin through the dust lookin for a sign
If theres a light up ahead well brother I dont know
But I got this fever burnin in my soul
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
Further on up the road
One sunny mornin well rise I know
And Ill meet you further on up the road
One sunny mornin well rise I know
And Ill meet you further on up the road
