Hey get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
A little shoeshine boy he never gets low down
But hes got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well I asked him while he shined my shoes
Howd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
He popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
Itll shake all your trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Well I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was going to jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said youre a mighty little boy to bea working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again


Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime just a nickel a shoe
But does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues
