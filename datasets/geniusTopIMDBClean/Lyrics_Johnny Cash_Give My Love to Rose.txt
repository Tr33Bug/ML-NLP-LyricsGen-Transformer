I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years Ive paid for what Ive done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son
Give my love to Rose please wont you mister
Take her all my money tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddys so proud of him
And dont forget to give my love to Rose
Wont you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
Because it aint right that she should live alone
Mister heres a bag with all my money
It wont last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now dont forget to give my love to Rose
Give my love to Rose please wont you mister
Take her all my money tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddys so proud of him
And dont forget to give my love to Rose
