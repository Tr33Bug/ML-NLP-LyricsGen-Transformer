Give My Love to Rose Lyrics
I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose
Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to help his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
Because it ain't right that she should live alone
Mister here's a bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose

Give my love to Rose please, won't you mister?
Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to RoseYou might also like7Embed
