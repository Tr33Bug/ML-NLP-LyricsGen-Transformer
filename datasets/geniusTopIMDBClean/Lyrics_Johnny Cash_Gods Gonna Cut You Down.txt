You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Go tell that longtongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler the backbiter
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news
My heads been wet with the midnight dew
Ive been down on bended knee talkin to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said John go do My will
Go tell that longtongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler the backbiter
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
Whats done in the dark will be brought to the light


You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Sooner or later Godll cut you down
Go tell that longtongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler the gambler the backbiter
Tell em that Gods gonna cut you down
Tell em that Gods gonna cut you down
Tell em that Gods gonna cut you down
