Heart of Gold LyricsI want to live

That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold

I crossed the ocean
For a heart of gold

That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
For a heart of gold
You keep me searching
For a heart of gold
I've been a miner
For a heart of gold
And I'm getting oldYou might also like4Embed
