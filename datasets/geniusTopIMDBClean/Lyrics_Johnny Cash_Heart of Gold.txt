I want to live
I want to give
Ive been a miner
For a heart of gold
Its these expressions
I never give
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And Im getting old
Keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And Im getting old
Ive been to Hollywood
Ive been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean
For a heart of gold
Ive been in my mind
Its such a fine line
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And Im getting old
That keeps me searching
For a heart of gold
And Im getting old
For a heart of gold
You keep me searching
For a heart of gold
Ive been a miner
For a heart of gold
And Im getting old
