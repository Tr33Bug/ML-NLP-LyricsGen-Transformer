Early one morning
With time to kill
I borrowed Jebbs rifle
And sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider
Crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him
To practice my aim
My brothers rifle
Went off in my hand
A shot rang out
Across the land
The horse he kept running
The rider was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I set off running
To wake from the dream
My brothers rifle
Went into the sheen
I kept on running
Into the south lands
Thats where they found me
My head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me
Why had I run
And then it came to me
Just what I had done
And all for no reason
Just one piece of lead
I hung my head
I hung my head
Here in the courthouse
The whole town was there
I see the judge
High up in his chair
Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
And well ask the jury
What verdict they find
I felt the power
Of death over life
I orphaned his children
I widowed his wife
I begged their forgiveness
I wish I was dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my
Early one morning
With time to kill
I see the gallows
Up on the hill
And out in the distance
A trick of the brain
I see a lone rider
Crossing the plain
And hed come to fetch me
To see what theyd done
And well ride together
To kingdom come
I pray for Gods mercy
For soon Ill be dead
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
I hung my head
