I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because youre mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each days through
Yes Ill admit that Im a fool for you
Because youre mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness Ive known proves that its right
Because youre mine I walk the line
Youve got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I cant hide
For you I know Id even try to turn the tide
Because youre mine I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because youre mine I walk the line
