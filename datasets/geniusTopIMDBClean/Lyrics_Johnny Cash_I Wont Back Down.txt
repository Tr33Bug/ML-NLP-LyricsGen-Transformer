Well I wont back down no I wont back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I wont back down
Going to stand my ground wont be turned around
And Ill keep this world from dragging me down
Going to stand my ground and I wont back down
Hey baby there is no easy way out
Hey I will stand my ground and I wont back down
Well I know whats right I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground and I wont back down
