I Wonâ€™t Back Down Lyrics
Well I won't back down, no I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
Going to stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down
Going to stand my ground and I won't back down

Hey baby, there is no easy way out
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down
Well I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground and I won't back down
