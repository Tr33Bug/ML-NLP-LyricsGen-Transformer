If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway
Would you have my baby
If you were a carpenter
And I were a lady
Id marry you anyway
Id have your baby
If a tinker was my trade
Would I still find you
Id be carrying the pots you made
Following behind you
Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow
If I were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your color blouse
And your soft shoe shining
If you were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding
Id miss my color blouse
And my soft shoe shining
Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow
If I worked my hands in wood
Would you still love me
Id answered you Yes I would
And would you not be above me
If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Id marry you anyway
Id have your baby
Save your  love through loneliness
Save your love through sorrow
I gave you my onliness
Give me your tomorrow
