Iâ€™ll Fly Away Lyrics
Some glad morning when this life is o'er
I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away
Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To that land where joy will never end
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly away

Oh, I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
I'll fly awayYou might also likeEmbed
