Some glad morning when this life is oer
Ill fly away
To that home on Gods celestial shore
Ill fly away
Ill fly away oh glory
Ill fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by
Ill fly away
Just a few more weary days and then
Ill fly away
To that land where joy will never end
Ill fly away
Ill fly away oh glory
Ill fly away
When I die hallelujah by and by
Ill fly away
Oh Ill fly away oh glory
Ill fly away in the morning
When I die hallelujah by and by
Ill fly away
