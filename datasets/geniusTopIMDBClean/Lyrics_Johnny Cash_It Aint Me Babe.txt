Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
Im not the one you want babe
Im not the one you need
You say youre looking for someone
Whos never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it aint me babe
No no no it aint me babe
It aint me youre looking for babe
Go lightly from the ledge babe
Go lightly on the ground
Im not the one you want babe
Ill only let you down
You say youre looking for someone
Wholl promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
You say youre looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothing more
