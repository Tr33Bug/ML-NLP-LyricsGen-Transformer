Well you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well theres a reason for the things that I have on
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because hes a victim of the time
I wear the black for those whove never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why youd think Hes talking straight to you and me
Well were doing mighty fine I do suppose
In our streakoflightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so were reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundredthousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side
Well theres things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But til we start to make a move to make a few things right
Youll never see me wear a suit of white
Ah Id love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everythings okay
But Ill try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter Im the Man In Black
