Well I left Kentucky back in 49
And went to Detroit working on assembly line
The first year they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day Id watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes Id hang my head and cry
Because I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
Id sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured Id have it all by the time I retired
Id have me a car worth at least a hundred grand
Id get it one piece at a time
And it wouldnt cost me a dime
Youd know its me when I come through your town
Im going to ride around in style
Im going to drive everybody wild
Because Ill have the only one there is around
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
Ive never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldnt miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddys mobile home
Now up to now my plan went all right
Until we tried to put it all together one night
And thats when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a 53
And the motor turned out to be a 73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an adaptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well thats when we noticed that we only had one tailfin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said Honey take me for a spin
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the courthouse they didnt laugh
Because to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds


I got it one piece at a time
And it didnt cost me a dime
Youll know its me when I come through your town
Im going to ride around in style
Im going to drive everybody wild
Because Ill have the only one there is around
Uh yeah Red Ryder
This is the Cotton Mouth
In the PsychoBilly Cadillac come on
Huh This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this mochine there Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory
And picked it up its cheaper that way
Uh what model is it
Well its a 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56
57 58 59 automobile
Its a 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67
68 69 70 automobile
