I walked through a county courthouse square
On a park bench an old man was sitting there
I said Your old court house is kind of run down
He said Naw itll do for our little town
I said Your old flag pole is leaned a little bit
And thats a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
He said Have a seat and I sat down
Is this the first time youve been to our little town
I said I think it is
He said I dont like to brag but were kind of proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
You see we got a little hole in that flag there
When Washington took it across the Delaware
And It got powder burned the night Francis Scott Key sat watching it
Writing Say Can You See
It got a rip in New Orleans with Packingham  Jackson
Tugging at its seams
And It almost fell at the Alamo
Beside the Texas flag
But she waved on though
She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
There was Robert E Lee and Beauregard and Bragg
And the south wind blew hard on
That Ragged Old Flag
On Flanders Field in World War I
She got a big hole from a Bertha Gun
She turned blood red in World War II
She hung limp and low a time or two
She was in Korea Vietnam She went where she was sent
By her Uncle Sam
She waved from our ships upon the briny foam
And now theyve about quit waving back here at home
In her own good land here Shes been abused
Shes been burned dishonored denied an refused
And the government for which she stands
Has been scandalized throughout out the land
And shes getting thread bare and shes wearing thin
But shes in good shape for the shape shes in
Because shes been through the fire before
And I believe she can take a whole lot more
So we raise her up every morning
And we bring her down slow every night
We dont let her touch the ground
And we fold her up right
On second thought
I do like to brag
Because  Im mighty proud of
That Ragged Old Flag
