I was thinking about you guys yesterday Now Ive been here three times before and I think I understand a little bit of how you feel about some things Its none of my business how you feel about some other things and I dont give a damn about how you feel about some other things But anyway I tried to put myself in your place and I believe this is how I would feel about San Quentin
San Quentin youve been livin hell to me
Youve hosted me since nineteen sixty three
Ive seen em come and go and Ive seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why
San Quentin I hate every inch of you
Youve cut me and have scarred me through and through
And Ill walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman you cant understand
San Quentin what good do you think you do
Do you think Ill be different when youre through
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin youve been living hell to me
Thank you very much One more time Maybe before we do it though if any of the guards are still speaking to me can I have a glass of water
laughter applause
