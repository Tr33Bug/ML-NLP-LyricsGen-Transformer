I saw her through the window today
She was sittin in the Silver Spoon Cafe
I started to keep going but something made me stop
She used to love me a lot
She looked lonely and I knew the cure
Old memories would win her heart for sure
I thought Id walk on in and Id give it my best shot
She used to love me a lot
I sat down beside her and she smiled
She said where have you been Its been a while
She was glad to see me I could almost read her thoughts
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me with a love that wouldnt die
Looking at her now I cant believe I said goodbye
It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
She used to love me a lot
I remember how good it was back then
And I said its not too late to start again
We could spend the night together take up where we left off
She used to love me a lot
But I panicked as she turned to walk away
As she went out the door I heard her say
Yes Im in need of something but something you aint got
But I used to love you a lot
I thought she loved me with a love that wouldnt die
Looking at her now I cant believe she said goodbye
She just left me standing there Ive never been so shocked
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
She used to love me a lot
