Belinda was mine until the time that I found her
Holdin Jim
And loving him
Then Sue came along loved me strong thats what I thought
Me and Sue
But that died too
Dont know that I will but until I can find me
A girl wholl stay and wont play games behind me
Ill be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man
Ive had it to here  being where loves a small word
A part time thing
A paper ring
I know its been done having one girl who loved me
Right or wrong
Weak or strong
Dont know that I will but until love can find me
And a girl wholl stay and wont play games behind me
Ill be what I am
A solitary man
A solitary man
