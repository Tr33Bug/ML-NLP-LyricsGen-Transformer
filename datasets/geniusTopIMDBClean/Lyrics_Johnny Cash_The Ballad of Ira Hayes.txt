Ira Hayes
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He wont answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Gather round me people theres a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Iras peoples crops
Until the white man stole the water rights
And the sparkling water stopped
Now Iras folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came Ira volunteered
And forgot the white mans greed
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He wont answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
There they battled up Iwo Jimas hill
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twentyseven lived to walk back down again
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He wont answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Ira Hayes returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand


But he was just a Pima Indian
No water no home no chance
At home nobody cared what Irad done
And when did the Indians dance
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He wont answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Then Ira started drinking hard
Jail was often his home
Theyd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like youd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He wont answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinking Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war
Yeah call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died
