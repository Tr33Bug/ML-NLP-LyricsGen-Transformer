Im a charger
That charges through the night
Like an orange bolt of lightning
Passing everything in sight
Im the best pal the Duke boys ever had
Im thunder on the highway looking bad bad bad
Im a knight
Like the kind in shining armor
With my polished body gleaming
Im a fighter and a charmer
If trouble comes your way just ask for me
My friends all know me as the General Lee
Im the General Lee
A piston pumpin steel belted cavalry
Ill never let you down when youre riding with me
Buckle up and Ill show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
Well cross the field and well be runnin free
Theyll eat dust with compliments of me
The General Lee
Im a hero
And thats how Ill make you feel
When youre riding shotgun with me
And the law is at your heels
Im glory bound and when the chase is done
Ill take off through the mountains and have fun fun fun
Ive got style
Tearing through the curves
With my flag waving proudly to the people that I serve
Im number 1 and Ill always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee
Im the General Lee
A piston pumpin steel belted cavalry
Ill never let you down when youre riding with me
Buckle up and Ill show you what I mean
Take a look back there
Sirens blowing red lights flashing everywhere
Ill jump that pond and well be running free
And theyll go swimming compliments of me
The General Lee
The General Lee
General Lee
