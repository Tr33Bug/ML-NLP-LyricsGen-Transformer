Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The Judge said Son what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else you wont have to die
I spoke not a word though it meant my life
Id been in the arms of my best friends wife
Now the scaffold seemed high and eternity was near
She stood in the crowd but she shed not a tear
But some times at night when the cold wind calls
She comes to my grave and she moans oer my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
