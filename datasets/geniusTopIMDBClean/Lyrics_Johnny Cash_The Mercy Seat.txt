It all began when they took me from my home
And put me on Death Row
A crime for which I am totally innocent you know
I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolleys wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way Im yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And Im not afraid to die
I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross
Might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least thats what Im told
My killhands
Tatooed EVIL across its brothers fist
That filthy five They did nothing to challenge or resist
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which Im told
All history does unfold
Its made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied


And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way Im yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And Im not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way Im hopin
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way there was no proof
And Im not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way Im hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief
A life for a life
And a truth for a truth
And Ive got nothing left to loose
And Im not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way thats helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And any way I told the truth
But Im afraid I told a lie
