Wanted man in California
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City
Wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi
Wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man
I might be in Colorado
Or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Dont you breathe it to nobody because you know Im on the lamb
Wanted man by Lucy Watson
Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson
Wanted man in this next town
Ive had all that I wanted of a lot of things Ive had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
I got sidetracked in El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wondering why Im wanted at some town half way in between
Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge
Theres somebody set to grab me
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight
You might get a glimpse of me
