Im just a poor wayfaring stranger
Travelling through this world below
Theres no sickness no toil nor danger
In that bright land to which I go
Im going there to see my Father
And all my loved ones whove gone on
Im just going over Jordan
Im just going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is hard and steep
But beauteous fields arise before me
Where Gods redeemed their vigils keep
Im going there to see my Mother
She said shed meet me when I come
So Im just going over Jordan
Im just going over home
