Well meet again
Dont know where
Dont know when
But I know
Well meet again
Some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I wont be long
And theyll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song
Well meet again
Dont know where
Dont know when
But I know
Well meet again
Some sunny day
Yeah Well meet again
I Dont know where
I Dont know when
But I do know
That Well meet again
Some sunny day
So honey
Keep on smiling through
Just like you
Always do
Until the blue skies drive
The dark clouds
Far away
And will you please say hello
To the folks that I know
Tell them that I wont be long
And theyll be happy to know
That when you saw me go
I was singing this song
Well meet again
Dont know where
Dont know when
But I know
Well meet again
Some sunny day
