The other night dear as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke dear I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried
You are my sunshine my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
Youll never know dear how much I love you
Please dont take my sunshine away
Ive always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now youve left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams
You are my sunshine my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
Youll never know dear how much I love you
Please dont take my sunshine away
Oh thats how you get through the verse 
Laughter
It was a nice short version
Do you wanna uh pick it up
Its alright  Its good 
We got a short version 
It might have that other verse on it in another take
Well Ill tell you what Lets uhm
Well if I feel like my songs a song Laughter
It dont care  There you go 
I dont care if its short
And I feel like my songs a song
A pleasure Two minutes Ive recorded songs two minutes
They were huge hits 
Have you got uh time on that
