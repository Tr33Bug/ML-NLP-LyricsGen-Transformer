You Are My Sunshine Lyrics
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

(Oh, that's how you get through the verse)
*Laughter*
It was a nice short version
Do you wanna- uh, pick it up?
I't's alright (It's good)
(We got a short version)
It might have that other verse on it in another take
Well, I'll tell you what... Let's... uhm...
Well, if I feel like my song's a song... *Laughter*
It don't care... (There you go!)
I don't care if it's short
And I feel like my song's a song
A pleasure! Two minutes... I've recorded songs two minutes
(They were huge hits!)
Have you got, uh, time on that?You might also like8Embed
