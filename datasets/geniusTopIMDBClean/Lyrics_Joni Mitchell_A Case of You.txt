Just before our love got lost you said
I am as constant as a northern star
And I said Constantly in the darkness
Wheres that at
If you want me Ill be in the bar
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face sketched on it twice
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case of you darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh I would still be on my feet
Oh I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
Im frightened by the devil
And Im drawn to those ones that aint afraid
I remember that time you told me you said
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine
Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case of you darling
Still Id be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
I met a woman she had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said Go to him stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed
Oh but you are in my blood you are my holy wine
Youre so bitter bitter and so sweet
Oh I could drink a case of you darling
Still Id be on my feet
I would still be on my feet
