They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel a boutique and a swingin hot spot
Dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone
They paved paradise put up a parking lot

They took all the trees put em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see em
Dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone
They paved paradise put up a parking lot

Hey farmer farmer put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees please
Dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone
They paved paradise put up a parking lot

Late last night I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone
They paved paradise put up a parking lot
Shoobopbopbopbop 
I said dont it always seem to go
That you dont know what youve got til its gone
They paved paradise put up a parking lot

They paved paradise put up a parking lot
