Ive got a blue motel room with a blue bedspread
Ive got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me when I call you up when Im down
Here in Savannah its pouring rain
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
Will you still love me when I call you up when I get back to town
I know that youve got all those pretty girls coming on
Hanging on your boomboompachyderm
Will you tell those girls that youve got German Measles
Honey tell them youve got germs
I hope youll be thinking of me because Ill be thinking of you
While Im traveling home alone
Tell those girls that youve got Joni shes coming back home
Ive got road maps from two dozen states
Ive got coast to coast just to contemplate
Will you still love me when I get back to town
Its funny how these old feelings hang around
You think theyre gone no no they just go underground
Will you still love me when I get back to LA town
You and me were like America and Russia
Were always keeping score
Were always balancing the power
And that can get to be a cold cold war
Were going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
In some neutral caf
You lay down your sneaking round the town honey
And Ill lay down the highway
Ive got a blue motel room with a blue bedspread
Ive got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me when I get back to town
