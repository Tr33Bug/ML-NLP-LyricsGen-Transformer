Blue songs are like tattoos
You know Ive been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Hey Blue there is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well theres so many sinking now
You gotta keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid booze and ass
Needles guns and grass
Lots of laughs lots of laughs
Everybodys saying that
Hells the hippest way to go
Well I dont think so
But Im gonna take a look around it though
Blue I love you
Blue here is a shell for you
Inside youll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me
