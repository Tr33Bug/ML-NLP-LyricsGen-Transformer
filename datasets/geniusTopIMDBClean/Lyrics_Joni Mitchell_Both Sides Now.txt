Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
Ive looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
Ive looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
Its cloud illusions I recall
I really dont know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
Ive looked at love that way
But now its just another show
You leave em laughing when you go
And if you care dont let them know
Dont give yourself away
Ive looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
Its loves illusions I recall
I really dont know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
Ive looked at life that way


But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads they say Ive changed
Well somethings lost but somethings gained
In living every day
Ive looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
Its lifes illusions I recall
I really dont know life at all
Ive looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
Its lifes illusions I recall
I really dont know life at all
