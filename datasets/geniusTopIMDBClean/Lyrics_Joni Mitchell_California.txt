Sitting in a park in Paris France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They wont give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldnt wanna stay here
Its too old and cold and settled in its ways here
Oh but California
California Im coming home
Im going to see the folks I dig
Ill even kiss a Sunset pig
California Im coming home
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh the rogue the red red rogue
He cooked good omelets and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there
But my heart cried out for you
California
Oh California Im coming home
Oh make me feel good rock n roll band
Im your biggest fan
California Im coming home
Oh it gets so lonely
When youre walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues
So I bought me a ticket
I got on a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone reading Vogue
They said How long can you hang around
I said a week maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown the Im going home
To California
California Im coming home
Oh will you take me as I am
Strung out on another man
California Im coming home
Oh it gets so lonely
When youre walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Oh will you take me as I am
Will you take me as I am
Will you
Will you take me as I am
Hmmm mmmmm
Take me as I am
