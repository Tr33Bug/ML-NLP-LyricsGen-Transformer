Ive been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
Ive been listening to the sirens and the radio
He said hed be over three hours ago
Ive been waiting for his car on the hill
He makes friends easy hes not like me
I watch for judgement anxiously
Now where in the city can that boy be
Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill
Hes a real good talker I think hes a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend
But theres still no buzzer they roll on
And Im waiting for his car on the hill
It always seems so righteous at the start
When theres so much laughter when theres so much spark
When theres so much sweetness in the dark
Waiting for a car
Climbing
Climbing
Climbing the hill
