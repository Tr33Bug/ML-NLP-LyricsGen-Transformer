The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldnt sleep
Oh you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey
But its really not my home
My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And my fancy French cologne
Oh Carey get out your cane
And Ill put on some silver
Oh youre a mean old Daddy
But I like you fine
Come on down to the Mermaid Caf
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And well laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down
Lets have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Lets have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town
Come on Carey get out your cane
Ill put on some silver
Oh youre a mean old Daddy
But I like you
I like you I like you I like you
Maybe Ill go to Amsterdam
Or maybe Ill go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers round my room
But lets not talk about faretheewells now
The night is a starry dome
And theyre playin that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon


Come on Carey get out your cane
And Ill put on some silver
Youre a mean old Daddy
But I like you
The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldnt sleep
Oh you know it sure is hard to leave here
But its really not my home
Maybe its been too long a time
Since I was scramblin down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne
Oh Carey get out your cane
Ill put on my finest silver
Well go to the Mermaid Caf
Have fun tonight
I said oh youre a mean old Daddy
But youre out of sight
