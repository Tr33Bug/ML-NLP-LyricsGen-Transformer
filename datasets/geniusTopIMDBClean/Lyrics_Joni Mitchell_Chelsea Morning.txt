Woke up it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
And well wear it till the night comes
Woke up it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Blue red green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
Theres a sun show every second
Now the curtain opens
On a portait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away
Woke up it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses
Oh wont you stay
Well put on the day
And well talk in present tenses
When the curtain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewellight
If only you will stay
Pretty baby wont you
Wake up its a Chelsea morning
