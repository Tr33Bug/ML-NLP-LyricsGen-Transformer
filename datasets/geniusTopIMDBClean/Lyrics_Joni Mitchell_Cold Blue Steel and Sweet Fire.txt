Cold Blue Steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet Fire calling You cant deny me
Now you know what you need
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollowgreyfireescapethief
Looking for Sweet Fire
Shadow of Lady Release
Come with me I know the way she says
Its down down down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first leave someone a letter
You can come now or you can come later
A wristwatch a ring a downstairs screamer
Edgy black cracks of the sky
Pincushionprick fix this poor bad dreamer
Money cold shadows reply
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors spiton prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire
Black soot of Lady Release
Come with me I know the way she says
Its down down down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first does it really matter
You can come now or you can come later
Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging but its indistinct
Someones HIFi drumming Jelly Roll


Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Fall into Lady Release
Come with me I know the way she says
Its down down down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first I mean what does it really matter
Youre going to come now or youre going to come later
