He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows thats what hell find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafs
And I only say Hello
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him like a ring to wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him
Secrets and sharing soda
Thats how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
Its secondhand
But Ill listen to his questions
Ill give my answers when theyre found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know she keeps him down
She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I dont believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And hell speak his sorrows endlessly and hell ask me why
Why cant I leave her


He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows thats what hell find
He knows thats what hell find
