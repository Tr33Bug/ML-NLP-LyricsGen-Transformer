Love came to my door with a sleeping roll and a madmans soul
He thought for sure Id seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman to court and spark
He was playing on the sidewalk for passing change
When something strange happened glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made in Peoples Park
And went looking for a woman to court and spark
It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him and still acting kind
He saw how I worried sometimes
I worry sometimes
All the guilty people he said theyve all seen the stain
On their daily bread on their Christian names
I cleared myself I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me Id complete you
His eyes were the color of the sand and the sea
And the more he talked to me you know the more he reached me
But I couldnt let go of LA
City of the fallen angels
