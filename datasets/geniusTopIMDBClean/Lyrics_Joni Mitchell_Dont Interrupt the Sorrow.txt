Dont interrupt the sorrow darn right
In flames our prophet witches be polite
A room full of glasses he says Your notches liberation doll
And he chains me with that serpent to that Ethiopian wall
Anima rising Queen of Queens
Wash my guilt of Eden wash and balance me
Anima rising uprising in me tonight
Shes a vengeful little goddess with an ancient crown to fight
Truth goes up in vapors the steeples lean
Winds of change patriarchs snug in your bible belt dreams
God goes up the chimney like childhood Santa Claus
The good slaves love the good book a rebel loves a cause
Im leaving on the 115 youre darn right
Since I was seventeen Ive had no one over me
He says Anima rising so what
Petrified wood process tall timber down to rock
Dont interrupt the sorrow darn right
He says We walked on the moon you be polite
Dont let up the sorrow death and birth and death and birth and death and birth
He says Bring that bottle kindly and Ill pad your purse
Ive got a head full of quandary and a mighty mighty mighty thirst
Seventeen glasses Rhine wine
Milk of the Madonna clandestine
He dont let up the sorrow he lies and he cheats
It takes a heart like Marys these days when your man gets weak
