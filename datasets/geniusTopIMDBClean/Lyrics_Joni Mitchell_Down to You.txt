Everything comes and goes
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
Things that you held high and told yourself were true
Lost or changing as the days come down to you
Down to you constant stranger
Youre a kind person youre a cold person too
Its down to you
It all comes down to you
You go down to the pick up station
Craving warmth and beauty
You settle for less than fascination
A few drinks later youre not so choosy
When the closing lights strip off the shadows
On this strange new flesh youve found
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf you hurry
To the blackness and the blankets
To lay down an impression and your loneliness
In the morning there are lovers in the street they look so high
You brush against a stranger and you both apologize
Old friends seem indifferent you must have brought that on
Old bonds have broken down love is gone
Love is gone written on your spirit this sad song
Love is gone
Everything comes and goes
Pleasure moves on too early and trouble leaves too slow
Just when youre thinking youve finally got it made
Bad news comes knocking at your garden gate
Knocking for you constant stranger
Youre a brute youre an angel
You can crawl you can fly too
Its down to you
It all comes down to you
