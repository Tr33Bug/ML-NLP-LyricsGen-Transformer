The way I see it he said you just cant win it
Everybodys in it for their own gain
You cant please em all
Theres always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
Theres a lot of people asking for my time
Theyre trying to get ahead
Theyre trying to be a good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no ones future to decide
You know Id go back there tomorrow
But for the work Ive taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery behind the popular song
I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If l had my way Id just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champslyses
Going caf to cabaret
Thinking how Ill feel when I find
That very good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No ones future to decide
You know Id go back there tomorrow
But for the work Ive taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery behind the popular song
