Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties Snack Bar boarded up now
And Egles the Tailor and the Shine Boys gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handys cast in bronze
And hes standing in a little park with his trumpet in his hand
Like hes listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed with his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginnys there for her kindness and Furrys beer
Shes the old mans angel overseer
Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the grey decay
They chew the last few dollars off old Beale Streets carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and hell play for you
Its mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played I could really feel
Theres a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girls silent across the street
Shes silent waiting for the wreckers beat
Silent staring at her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter ghosts
History falls to parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street


Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and says I dont like you
Everybody laughs as if its the old mans standard joke
But its true were only welcome for our drink and smoke
W C Handy Im rich and Im fey
And Im not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like its a Saturday night theyre in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck and time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
Old Furry sings the blues
