Heatwaves on the runway
As the wheels set down
He takes his baggage off the carousel
He takes a taxi into town
Yellow schools of taxi fishes
Jonah in a ticking whale
Caught up at the lights in the fishnet windows
Of Bloomingdales
Watching those high fashion girls
Skinny black models with Raven curls
Beauty parlor blondes with credit card eyes
Looking for the chic and the fancy to buy
He opens up his suitcase
In the continental suite
And people thirty stories down
Look like colored currents in the street
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof
Like a dragonfly on a tomb
And business men in button downs
Press into conference rooms
Battalions of paperminded males
Talking commodities and sales
While at home their paper wives and paper kids
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid
Yellow checkers for the kitchen
Climbing ivy for the bath
She is lost in House and Gardens
Hes caught up in Chief of Staff
He drifts off into the memory
Of the way she looked in school
With her body oiled and shining
At the public swimming pool
The more Im with you pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
Im building all my dreams around you
Our happiness will never cease
Cause nothings any good without you
Baby youre my centerpiece
Well find a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
Cause nothings any good without you
Baby youre my centerpiece
Shining hair and shining skin
Shining as she reeled him in
To tell him like she did today
Just what he could do with Harrys House
And Harrys take home pay
