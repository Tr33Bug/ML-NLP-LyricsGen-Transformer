Help me I think Im falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling I know Im in trouble again
Im in trouble cause youre a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man
And you love your lovin
But not like you love your freedom
Help me I think Im falling in love too fast
Its got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
Cause Ive seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin
But not like we love our freedom
Didnt it feel good we were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking didnt it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didnt it feel good didnt it feel good
Help me I think Im falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
Thats such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting hurting too
We love our lovin
But not like we love our freedom
