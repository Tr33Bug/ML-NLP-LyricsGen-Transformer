Funny day looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote I love you in my finest hand
Wanted to send it but I dont know where I stand
Telephone even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess its too early cause I dont know where I stand
Crickets call courting their ladies in stardappled green
Thickets tall until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty so drowsy now Ill take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you but I dont know where I stand
I know that I miss you but I dont know where I stand
