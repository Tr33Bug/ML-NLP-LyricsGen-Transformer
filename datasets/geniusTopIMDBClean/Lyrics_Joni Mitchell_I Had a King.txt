I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately hes taken to painting the pastel walls brown
Hes taken the curtains down
Hes swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
Hes cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughters sting
I cant go back there anymore
You know my keys wont fit the door
You know my thoughts dont fit the man
They never can
They never can
I had a king dressed in dripdry and paisley
Lately hes taken to saying Im crazy and blind
He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind
I cant go back there anymore
You know my keys wont fit the door
You know my thoughts dont fit the man
They never can
They never can
I had a king in a saltrusted carriage
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
Theres no one to blame
No theres no one to name as a traitor here
The kings on the road
And the queens in the grove til the end of the year
I cant go back there anymore
You know my keys wont fit the door
You know my thoughts dont fit the man
They never can
They never can
They never can
They never can
