Downtown my darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence rock n roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs a girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading in a suburban room
I said take me to the dance do you want to dance
I love to dance
And I told him they dont take chances
They seem so removed from romance
Theyve been broken in churches and schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rollin rollin rock n rollin
Downtown the dancehalls and cafs
Feel so wild you could break somebodys heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise in those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings drinking up the bands beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars kissing in cafs
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour mama not cheap display
And we were rollin rollin rock n rollin
Downtown in the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
Hed be singing Bye Bye Love while hes racking up his free play
Let those rock n roll choir boys come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car or Ron had the car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
Wed all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And Id be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brandolike things that he said
And wed be rollin rollin rock n rollin
Rollin rollin rock n rollin
Rollin rollin rock n rollin
