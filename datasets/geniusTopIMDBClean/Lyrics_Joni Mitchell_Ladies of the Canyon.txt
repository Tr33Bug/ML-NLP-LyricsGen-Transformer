Trina wears her wampum beads she fills her drawing book with lines
Sewing lace on widows weeds and filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leave are filigree and her coats a secondhand one
Trimmed with antique luxury she is a lady of the canyon
Annie sits you down to eat she always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies round her feet and all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat she may bake some brownies today
Saying you are welcome back she is another canyon lady
Estrella circus girl comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled at beveled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and beveled mirrors sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here to be a lady of the canyon
Trina takes her pins and her threads and she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads and she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers and Estrella dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours pouring music down the canyon
Coloring the sunshine hours they are the ladies of the canyon
