Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she will answer to
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her
Call her green for the children whove made her
Little green be a gypsy dancer
He went to California
Hearing that everythings warmer there
So you write him a letter and say Her eyes are blue
He sends you a poem and shes lost to you
Little green hes a nonconformer
Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
Therell be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
Therell be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes therell be sorrow
Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you are sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
Youre sad and youre sorry but youre not ashamed
Little green have a happy ending
Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
Therell be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
Therell be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes therell be sorrow
