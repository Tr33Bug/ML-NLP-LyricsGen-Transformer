Morning Morgantown Lyrics
When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milk trucks make their morning rounds
In morning Morgantown

We'll rise up early with the sun
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
And the day is young
In morning Morgantown
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning Morgantown

Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink at total strangers passing
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning in any town you name
Morning's just the same

I'd like to buy you everything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colored rings
In morning Morgantown
You might also like
But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same
Morning's just the sameEmbed
