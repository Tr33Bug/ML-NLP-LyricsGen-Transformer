My old man
Hes a singer in the park
Hes a walker in the rain
Hes a dancer in the dark
We dont need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man keeping away my blues
Hes my sunshine in the morning
Hes my fireworks at the end of the day
Hes the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord play and stay baby
We dont need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man keeping away my blues
But when hes gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The beds too big
The frying pans too wide
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We dont need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true no
My old man keeping away my blues


But when hes gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The beds too big
The frying pans too wide
My old man
Hes a singer in the park
Hes a walker in the rain
Hes a dancer in the dark
We dont need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true no
My old man keeping away my lonesome blues
