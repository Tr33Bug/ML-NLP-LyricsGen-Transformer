All the people at this party theyve got a lot of style
Theyve got stamps of many countries theyve got passport smiles
Some are friendly some are cutting some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre giving to get something
Photo beauty gets attention then her eye paints running down
Shes got a rose in her teeth and a lampshade crown
One minute shes so happy then shes crying on someones knee
Saying laughing and crying you know its the same release
I told you when I met you I was crazy cry for us all beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner thinking hes nobody
And Jack behind his joker and stonecold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence thinking I dont understand
I feel like Im sleeping can you wake me
You seem to have a broader sensibility
Im just living on nerves and feelings with a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to peoples parties fumbling deaf dumb and blind
I wish I had more sense of humor keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
