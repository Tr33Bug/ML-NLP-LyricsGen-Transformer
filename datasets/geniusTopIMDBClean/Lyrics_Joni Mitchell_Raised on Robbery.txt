He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion he was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
She says Let me sit down you know drinkin alones a shame
Its a shame its a crying shame
Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey youve got lots of cash
Bring us round a bottle and well have some laughs
Gins what Im drinking I was raised on robbery
Im a pretty good cook Im sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen Ill show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I cant save a cent
Im up after midnight cooking trying to make my rent
Im rough but Im pleasin I was raised on robbery
We had a little money once
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars
You should have seen it fly away
First he bought a 57 Biscayne he put it in a ditch
He drunk up all the rest that son of a bitch
His bloods bad whiskey I was raised on robbery
You know you aint bad looking I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey I aint asking for no full length mink
Hey where you going Dont go yet
Your glass aint empty and we just met
Youre mean when youre loaded I was raised on robbery
