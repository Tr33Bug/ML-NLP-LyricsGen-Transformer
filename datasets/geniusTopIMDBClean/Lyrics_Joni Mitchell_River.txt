Its coming on Christmas
Theyre cutting down trees
Theyre putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
But it dont snow here
It stays pretty green
Im gonna make a lot of money
Then Im gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
He tried hard to help me
You know he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
Im so hard to handle
Im selfish and Im sad
Now Ive gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye
Its coming on Christmas
Theyre cutting down trees
Theyre putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
