I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
I took a look at his license plate
It said Just Ice
Is justice just ice
Governed by greed and lust
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must
Oh and the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh sex kills
Doctors pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers havent been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs
Know the balance is undone
Crazy ions you can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh sex kills


All these jackoffs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packing guns to school
The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down
On the massive mess were in
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh sex kills
Sex kills
