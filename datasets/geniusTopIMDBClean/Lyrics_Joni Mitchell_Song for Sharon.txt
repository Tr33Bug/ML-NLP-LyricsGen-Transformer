I went to Staten Island Sharon
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin back with a belly full of cars
All for something lacy
Some girls going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy
Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
Theyll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
Im headed to the church to play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers flocks
I can keep my cool at poker
But Im a fool when loves at stake
Because I cant conceal emotion
What Im feelings always written on my face
Theres a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke
Sharon I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the Big Apple here
To face the dreams malfunction
Loves a repetitious danger
Youd think Id be accustomed to
Well I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do
A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction


Dora says Have children
Mama and Betsy say Find yourself a charity
Help the needy and the crippled
Or put some time into Ecology
Well theres a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really want to do right now
Is find another lover
When we were kids in Maidstone Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything
And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mamas nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here
Now there are twentynine skaters on Wollman Rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity a blank face at the window
Stares and stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feeling
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me
Sharon youve got a husband
And a family and a farm
Ive got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And Ive still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
Ill walk green pastures by and by
