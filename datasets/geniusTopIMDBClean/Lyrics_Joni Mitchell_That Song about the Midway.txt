I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black mans ear
You were playin on the horses you were playin on the guitar strings
You were playin like a devil wearin wings
Wearin wings you looked so grand wearin wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly I heard you can can you fly
Like an eagle doin your huntin from the sky
I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheatin once or twice
Once or twice I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wondrin was the gamble worth the price
Pack it in I heard you did pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win
So lately youve been hidin it was somewhere in the news
And Im still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like Ive been workin overtime
Over time Ive lost my fire over time
Always playin one more hand for one more dime
Slowin down Im gettin tired slowin down
And I envy you the valley that youve found
Cause Im midway down the midway
Slowin down
Down down down
