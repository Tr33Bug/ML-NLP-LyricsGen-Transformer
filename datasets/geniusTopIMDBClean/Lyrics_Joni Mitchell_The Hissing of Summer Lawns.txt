He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns
He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his to a Latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns
Darkness wonder makes it easy
Darkness with a joyful mask
Darkness tubes gone darkness darkness darkness
No color no contrast
A diamond dog carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
Theres a black fly buzzing
Theres a heat wave burning in her masters voice
Hissing summer lawns
He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale that nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
Its the ladys choice
The hissing of summer lawns
Darkness
Darkness
Darkness
Darkness
