The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in 68
And he told me All romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark caf
You laugh he said you think youre immune
Go look at your eyes theyre full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies pretty lies
When you gonna realize theyre only pretty lies
Only pretty lies just pretty lies
He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said Drink up now its gettin on time to close
Richard you havent really changed I said its just that
Now youre romanticizing some pain thats in your head
You got tombs in your eyes but the songs you punched are dreamy
Listen they sing of love so sweet love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet
Oh and love can be so sweet love so sweet
Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
Im gonna blow this damn candle out
I dont want nobody comin over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way someday
Hidin behind bottles in dark cafs
Dark cafs only a dark cocoon
Before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
Only a phase these dark caf days
