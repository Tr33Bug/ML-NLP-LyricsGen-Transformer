Look out the left the captain said
The lights down there thats where well land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
It wasnt the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one that you can wish upon
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors
Oh star bright star bright
Youve got the lovin that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldnt have got on this flight tonight
You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But youve got that look so critical
Now I cant talk to you baby I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Up theres the heavens down theres a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh blackness blackness dragging me down
Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine
Oh star bright star bright
Youve got the lovin that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldnt have got on this flight tonight
Im drinking sweet champagne got the headphones up high
Cant numb you out cant drum you out of my mind
Theyre playing Goodbye baby baby goodbye
Ooh ooh love is blind
Up go the flaps down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope its better when we meet again baby
Star bright star bright
Youve got the lovin that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
Shouldnt have got on this flight tonight
