Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of loves memories
Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback
Guess Ill throw them all away
I found someone to love today
Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden prince whos come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun
Still Ill take a chance and see
I found someone to love today
Theres a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him
In a Bleecker Street caf
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love today
