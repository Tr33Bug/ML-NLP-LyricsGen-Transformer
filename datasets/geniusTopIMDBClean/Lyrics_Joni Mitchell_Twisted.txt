My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
The way he described it he said Id be better dead than live
I didnt listen to his jive
I knew all along that he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought I was crazy but Im not
Oh no
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
He said I need treatment but Im not that easily led
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight to be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts
They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas but I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius
Whats so strange when you know that youre a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be
Now I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight
Thats why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic didnt know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three but I was swinging
They all laugh at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison and also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry if they just couldnt understand
The idiomatic logic that went on in my head
I had a brain it was insane
Oh they used to laugh at me when I refused to ride
On all those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top
My analyst told me that I was right out of my head
But I said Dear doctor I think that its you instead
Because I Ive got a thing thats unique and new
To prove it Ill have the last laugh on you
Cause instead of one head I got two
And you know two heads are better than one
