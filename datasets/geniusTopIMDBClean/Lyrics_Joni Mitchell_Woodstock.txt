I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him Where are you going
And this he told me
Im going on down to Yasgurs Farm
Im gonna join in a rock and roll band
Im gonna camp out on the land
Im gonna try and get my soul free
We are stardust
We are golden
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog
In something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe its the time of man
I dont know who I am
But you know life is for learning
We are stardust
We are golden
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song
And celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation


We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devils bargain
And we got to get ourselves back to the garden
