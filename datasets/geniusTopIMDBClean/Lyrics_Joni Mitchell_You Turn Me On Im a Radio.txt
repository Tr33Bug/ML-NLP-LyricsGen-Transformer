If youre driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number whos bound to love you
Oh honey you turn me on Im a radio
Im a country station Im a little bit corny
Im a wildwood flower waving for you
Im a broadcasting tower waving for you
And Im sending you out this signal here
I hope you can pick it up loud and clear
I know you dont like weak women you get bored so quick
And you dont like strong women cause theyre hip to your tricks
Its been dirty for dirty down the line
But you know I come when you whistle when youre loving and kind
But if youve got too many doubts
If theres no good reception for me then tune me out
Cause honey who needs the static it hurts the head
And you wind up cracking and the day goes dismal
From Breakfast Barney to the signoff prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
Im going to tell you again now if youre still listening there
If youre driving into town with a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number whos bound to love you
If youre lying on the beach with the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies honey the loves still flowing
If your head says forget it but your hearts still smoking
Call me at the station the lines are open
