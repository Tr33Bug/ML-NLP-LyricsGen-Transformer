You mesmerize slowly
Till I cant believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning youre here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
Im so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I cant resist a touch of evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Im so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I cant resist a touch of evil


Arousing me now
With a sense of desire
Possessing my soul
Until my bodys on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Youre possessing me
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I cant resist a touch of evil
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I cant resist a touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch
