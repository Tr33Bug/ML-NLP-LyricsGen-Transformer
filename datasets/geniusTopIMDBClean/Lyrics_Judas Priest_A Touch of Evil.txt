A Touch of Evil Lyrics
You mesmerize slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear

I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil

Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in

I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil
You might also like

Arousing me now
With a sense of desire
Possessing my soul
Until my body's on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
You're possessing me

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil

In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
