All Guns Blazing Lyrics
Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing

Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike

All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing


Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage
You might also like
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazingEmbed
