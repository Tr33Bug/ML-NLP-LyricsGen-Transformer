Angel put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again
Oh angel we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world were in
To a place where we began
And I know well find a better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that its all you want for you and me
Angel wont you set me free
Angel remember how wed chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun
When I close my eyes I hear your velvet wings and cry
Im waiting here with open arms oh cant you see
Angel shine your light on me
Angel well meet once more Ill pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again
