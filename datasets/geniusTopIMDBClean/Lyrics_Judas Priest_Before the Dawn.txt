Before the dawn I hear you whisper
In your sleep Dont let the morning take him
Outside the birds begin to call
As if to summon up my leaving
Its been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
Ive waited too long and now youre leaving
Oh please dont take it all away
Its been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
Ive waited too long and now youre leaving
Oh please dont take it all away
Before the dawn I hear you whisper
In your sleep Dont let the morning take him
