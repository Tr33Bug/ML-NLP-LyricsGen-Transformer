You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why Im alive within
I cant find the words my mind is dead
Its better by you better than me
Guess youll have to tell her how I tried
To speak up thoughts Ive held so long inside
Tell her now I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the worlds not much living for
Its better by you better than me
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you better than me
You can tell what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
Its better by you better than me
Guess Ill have to change my way of living
Dont want to really know the way I feel
Guess Ill learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They find my blood upon her windowsill
Its better by you better than me
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows


Better by you better than me
You can say what I only can see
You can tell what I want it to be
Its better by you better than me
Better by you better than me
You can tell what I want it to be  Better than me 
You can say what I only can see
Better by you better than me
Better by you better than me
You can say what I only can see  Better than me 
You can tell what I want it what I want it what I want it to be
