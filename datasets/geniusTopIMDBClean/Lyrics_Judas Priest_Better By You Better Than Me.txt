Better By You, Better Than Me Lyrics
You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why I'm alive within
I can't find the words, my mind is dead
It's better by you, better than me

Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak up thoughts I've held so long inside
Tell her now I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the world's not much living for
It's better by you, better than me
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows

Better by you, better than me
You can tell what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you, better than me

Guess I'll have to change my way of living
Don't want to really know the way I feel
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They find my blood upon her windowsill
It's better by you, better than me

Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
You might also like
Better by you, better than me
You can say what I only can see
You can tell what I want it to be
It's better by you, better than me

Better by you, better than me
You can tell what I want it to be (Better than me)
You can say what I only can see
Better by you, better than me
Better by you, better than me
You can say what I only can see (Better than me)
You can tell what I want it, what I want it, what I want it to be2Embed
