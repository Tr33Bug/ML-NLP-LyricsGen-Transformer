Storm warning
But theres no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
Theyll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the hammer and the anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptizes
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession  confess your sins 
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Between the hammer and the anvil
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
Theyll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sins
Between the hammer and the anvil
Between the hammer and the anvil
Between the hammer and the anvil
Between the hammer and the anvil
Storm warning
But theres no fear
