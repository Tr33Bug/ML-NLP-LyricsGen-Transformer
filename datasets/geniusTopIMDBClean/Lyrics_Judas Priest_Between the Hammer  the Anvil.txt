Between the Hammer & the Anvil Lyrics
Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high

The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the hammer and the anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptizes
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate

The burning sermons will survive their curse
Between the hammer and the anvil


Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
You might also like
The burning sermons consecrate their sins
Between the hammer and the anvil

Between the hammer and the anvil
Between the hammer and the anvil
Between the hammer and the anvil
Storm warning
But there's no fearEmbed
