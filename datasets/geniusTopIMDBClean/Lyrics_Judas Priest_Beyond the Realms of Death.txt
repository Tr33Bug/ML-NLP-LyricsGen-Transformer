He had enough he couldnt take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried they couldnt understand
They washed and dressed him fed him by hand
Yeah Ive left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
Im free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life Ill decide not you
Withdrawn hed sit there stare blank into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled it seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbye and then he died
Yeah Ive left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
Im free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life Ill decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
Its not fit for living in
Yeah I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But I shall win
How many like him are there still
But to us all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost
Yeah Ive left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
Im free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life Ill decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
Its not fit for living in
Beyond the realms of death
