Ive been trying
Theres no denying
Its sending me out of my mind
Ive seen reason
Change to treason
Its losing its sense of all kind
How much longer will it take for the world to see
We should learn to live and simply let it be
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
In the night time
Wake in fright
Im so scared of the game thats being played
Start to wonder
Whats going under
And how many deals have been made
How much longer will it take for the world to see
We should learn to live and simply let it be
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone  I cant take it 
Bloodstone  You got me living on a 
Bloodstone  I dont want that
