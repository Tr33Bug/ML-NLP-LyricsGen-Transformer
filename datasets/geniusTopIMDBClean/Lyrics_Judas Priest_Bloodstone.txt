Ive been trying
Theres no denying
Its sending me out of my mind
Ive seen reason

How much longer will it take for the world to see
We should learn to live and simply let it be

Start to wonder
Whats going under
And how many deals have been made
How much longer will it take for the world to see
We should learn to live and simply let it be
