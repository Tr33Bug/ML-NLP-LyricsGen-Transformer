Bloodstone Lyrics
I've been trying
There's no denying
It's sending me out of my mind
I've seen reason
Change to treason
It's losing its sense of all kind

How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone

In the night time
Wake in fright
I'm so scared of the game that's being played
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals have been made

How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be

Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone

Bloodstone (I can't take it)
Bloodstone (You got me living on a)
Bloodstone (I don't want that)
