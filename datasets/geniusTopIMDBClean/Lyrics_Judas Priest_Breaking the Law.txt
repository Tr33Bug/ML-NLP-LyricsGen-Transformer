There I was completely wasting out of work and down
All inside its so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
So much for the golden future I cant even start
Ive had every promise broken theres anger in my heart
You dont know what its like you dont have a clue
If you did youd find yourselves doing the same thing too
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
You dont know what its like
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
