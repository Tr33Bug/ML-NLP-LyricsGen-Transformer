Sun sets on the nations
Worlds in her disguise
Pray for all that matters
Saviour in my eyes
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Eden has been wasted
Deadly poison fills the air
Kneel down in forgiveness
While theres still time if you care
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
I couldnt dream
To be without her kind
They wouldnt let her be
Or heal what she defiled
You are the hate that beats mankind
Torturous lies that lead the blind
Squandered the truth from all we said
You are the reason I feel dead
Mountains start to crumble
Tumble in the sea
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
