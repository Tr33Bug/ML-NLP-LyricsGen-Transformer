Solar winds are blowing
Neutron star controlling
All is lost doomed and tossed at what cost forever
Meteors fly around me
Comets die and then they
And then they you wanna see how they try to surround me
I can say here today we shall stay forever
If you want to find us in a hurry
Oh let me tell you dont you worry
I cant say here today we shall stay forever
