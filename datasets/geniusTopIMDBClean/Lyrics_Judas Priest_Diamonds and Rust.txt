Ill be damned here comes your ghost again
But thats not unusual
Its just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice Id known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Now I see you standing all around
And snow in your hair
Now were smiling out the window of the crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes on white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both couldve died then and there
Now youre telling me youre not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause I need some of that vagueness now
Its all come back too clearly
Yes I love you dearly
And if youre offering me diamonds and rust
Ive already paid
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Diamonds diamonds and rust
Diamonds diamonds and rust
Diamonds diamonds and rust
Diamonds diamonds and rust
