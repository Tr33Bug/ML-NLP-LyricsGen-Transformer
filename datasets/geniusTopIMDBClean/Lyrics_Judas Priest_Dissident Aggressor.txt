Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected subjected to all
Stab bawl
Punch crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab bawl
Punch crawl
I know what I am Im Berlin
Through cracked blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall
Stab bawl
Punch crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab bawl
Punch crawl
I know what I am Im Berlin
Exploding reloading this quest neverending
Until I give out my last breath
Im stabbing and bawling
Im punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
Im stabbing and bawling
Im punching and crawling
I know what I am Im Berlin
