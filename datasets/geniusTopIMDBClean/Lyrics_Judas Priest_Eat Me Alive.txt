Wrapped tight around me like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body as the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
And eat me alive
Eat me alive
Sounds like an animal panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone and gasping from the heat
Gutwrenching frenzy that deranges every joint
Im going to force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Eat me alive
Bound to deliver as you give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as the rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum spreadeagled to the wall
Youre well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Alive alive alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat
