The devils moved from Georgia
His missions still the same
The worlds become his oyster once again
If you dont think youre worthy
And you dont meet the cause
He knows whats going on behind closed doors
Beware theres voodoo in the night
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
A master of deception
Who takes you by the hand
Then leads you to the palace of the damned
He pulls the strings inside you
And plays upon your fears
Your final scream is music to his ears
Beware theres voodoo in the night
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Im caught up in this voodoo
Trying to break free
I feel Im being smothered
Trapped by this entity
Blackened clouds surround me
Filling me with dread
I cant escape the horror
With the devil in my head
He relishes the suffering
Cant stand this heart attack
My lifes been taken hostage
And its never coming back


Beware theres voodoo in the night
The devils got you in his sight
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
Evil never dies
