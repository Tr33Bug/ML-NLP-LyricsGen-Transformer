Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon blazing to the land
Now hes here amongst us the age of fires at hand
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
Everything he touches fries into a crisp
Let him get close to you so youre in his trip
First youll smoke and smolder blister up and singe
When ignition hits you the very soul of your being will cringe
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man Where is he from
Exciter comes for everyone
Youll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
Hes come to make you snap out of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you see the light again
So much selfindulgence results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency leads to beguiling lies
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
When he leaps amidst us with combustive dance
All shall bear the branding of his thermal lance
Cauterizing masses melting into one
Only when theres order will his job be done
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Bow to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man Where is he from
Exciter comes for everyone
Youll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
Racing cross the heavens straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon blazing to the land
Now hes here amongst us the age of fires at hand
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
