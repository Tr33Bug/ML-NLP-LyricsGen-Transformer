Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead at breakneck speed
With high octane were spitting flames
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
On we catapult were thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault go headlong into any dare
We dont accept defeat we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat obliterations everywhere
Born to lead at breakneck speed
With high octane were spitting flames
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in never stops the way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and then concede
Youll find theres life with victory on high
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in never stops the way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and then concede
Youll find theres life with victory with victory on high
