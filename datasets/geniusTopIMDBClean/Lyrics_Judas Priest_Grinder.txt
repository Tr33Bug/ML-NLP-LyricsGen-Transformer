Never straight and narrow
I wont keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
Thats where theres thunder and the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene thats why I wont get caught
Refuse to bait the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
Ive held my licence
It came with birth
For selfreliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill I take my leave
