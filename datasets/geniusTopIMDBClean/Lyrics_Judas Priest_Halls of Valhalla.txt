Halls of Valhalla Lyrics
Valhalla

Fierce is the gale of the North Sea
We drink and rejoice from the chalice
Holding the course through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice

Toe the line, keep it fine
Every man seeks this end
Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belong

We crash o’er the waves
Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray on the storm’s maul
Then lightning reveals for what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard its landfall

Life from death, combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain

Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belong


The storm in the night
Takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore

Halls of Valhalla
Halls of Valhalla
Halls of Valhalla


Toe the line, keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

The halls of Valhalla, are calling me home
The halls of Valhalla, that's where we belong
Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belongEmbed
