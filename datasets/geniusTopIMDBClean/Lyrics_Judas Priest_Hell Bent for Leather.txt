Seek him here seek him on the highway
Never knowing when hell appear
All await engines ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams From a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Black as night faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams Crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Theres many who tried to prove that theyre faster
But they didnt last and they died as they tried
Theres many who tried to prove that theyre faster
But they didnt last and they died as they tried
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
