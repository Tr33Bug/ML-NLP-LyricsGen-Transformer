Like wild fire comes roaring
Mad whirlwind burning the road
Black thunder white lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol
Night riders death dealers
Storm bringers tear up the ground
Fist flying eyes blazing
Theyre glory bound
The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol
Brutalize you neutralize you
Going to go for your throat as you choke
Then theyll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you pulverize you
Going to cut to the bone as you groan
And theyll paratamize you
Chrome Masters steel Warriors
Soul Stealers ripping out hearts
Theyre Devil Dogs
The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol
