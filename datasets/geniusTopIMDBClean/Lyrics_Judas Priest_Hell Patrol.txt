Hell Patrol Lyrics
Like wild fire comes roaring
Mad whirlwind burning the road
Black thunder, white lightning
Speed demons cry

The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol

Night riders, death dealers
Storm bringers tear up the ground
Fist flying, eyes blazing
They're glory bound
The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol

Brutalize you, neutralize you
Going to go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you, pulverize you
Going to cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you


Chrome Masters, steel Warriors
Soul Stealers ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs
