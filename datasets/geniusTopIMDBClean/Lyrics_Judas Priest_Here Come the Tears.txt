Once I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away
Now it seems lifes passed me by Im still alone today
Here come the tears
Looks like itll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears
All alone no one cares so much to give to you all out there
Take me now in your arms let me rest safe from harm
Oh I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Wont somebody love me
Here they come here come the tears
