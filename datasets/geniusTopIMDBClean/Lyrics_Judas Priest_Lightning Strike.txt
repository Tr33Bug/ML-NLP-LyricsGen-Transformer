Ill bring you the head of the demon
Im peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace
Youre sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
Walking through fire fates in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike  Strike strike 
Lightning to strike
Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a powermad freaking intent
Youre sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
Walking through fire fates in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike  Strike strike 
Lightning to strike
Ill spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankinds at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For its all in the fight that we make
Youre sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell
Walking through fire fates in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike  Strike strike 
Lightning to strike
Lightning will strike
