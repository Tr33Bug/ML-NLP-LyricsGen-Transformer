Weve taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off Ive seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing wed be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robots scythes
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time theyd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath
