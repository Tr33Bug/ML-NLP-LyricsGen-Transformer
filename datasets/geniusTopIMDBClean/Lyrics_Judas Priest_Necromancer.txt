Born out of hell from the depths of Gomorrah
Purging new graves and defiling the souls
He satiates with such vile and dark horror
Omens of dread on this night of the ghouls
Raising the dead up from the ground
Needs must be fed sorceries abound
Necromancer
Deaths his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
Feeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed
Splintered the bones and regaled in his feast
Danced on the grave of the pure and the righteous
As the moonlights expelled from the eyes of the beast
Raising the dead blasphemy reigns
Portents of dread thrives on remains
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Deaths his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
Raising the dead cadaver consumed
Sacraments said bodies exhumed

Stealing after life
Stealing after life
