Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Dont look behind you
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know hes coming back
Night crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers our last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know theyre caught
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Dont look behind you
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know hes coming back
Night crawler


As night is falling
The end is drawing near
Theyll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
Come to me it calls
Atmospheres electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Dont look behind you
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night crawler
You know hes coming back
Night crawler
Hes going to get you
Hes going to get you
Beware of the beast
Night crawler
Beware of the beast
Hes going to get you
Night crawler
Straight out of hell
Beware of the beast
Hes going to get you
