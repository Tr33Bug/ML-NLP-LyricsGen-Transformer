You know that life isnt set
I lead the pack I aint no pretender
You give as good as you get
We live and die cause theres no surrender
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean my hearts on fire
Living my life aint no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
You know the way that I feel
If youre with me you better hold on tighter
Im only keeping it real
Thats who I am Im just a nonstop fighter
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean my hearts on fire
Living my life aint no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
Run out of road
The end of the days
Not for the weak
Only the brave
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean my hearts on fire
Living my life aint no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender


Im chasing a dream as I go higher
You know Im playing it mean my hearts on fire
Im living my life aint no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
