Im laying awake at nights
I cant get you out of my mind
All I can hear is my heartbeat
And the voice in the dark of some kind
Where are you now
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though Im out in the cold
Out in the cold
Hear me calling cold
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
I know it was you I hurt
I didnt mean to hurt you 
So much to forgive and forget
Cant take anymore of this hurt
Oh no oh no 
Theres so many things I regret
Where are you now
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though Im out in the cold
Shut me out 
Out in the cold
Where are you now 
Hear me calling
I need you Im so cold 
Cant you hear my heartbeat 
Out in the cold
Please rescue me


Give me a chance baby
Ah theres nothing I wouldnt do to make it alright
Just one more chance baby
I need all your loving tonight
Where are you now
The fears are coming back to me once again
Oh I wish you were here
Taking good care of me
I want you
I feel as though Im out in the cold
Shut me out 
Out in the cold
Where are you now 
Hear me calling
I need you Im so cold 
Cant you hear my heartbeat 
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
Why dont you rescue me 
Cold
Shut me out 
Out in the cold
Where are you now 
Hear me calling
I need you Im so cold 
Cant you hear my heartbeat 
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
Why dont you rescue me 
Im so cold
Shut me out 
Out in the cold
Where are you now 
Hear me calling
I need you Im so cold 
Cant you hear my heartbeat 
Out in the cold
Please rescue me
