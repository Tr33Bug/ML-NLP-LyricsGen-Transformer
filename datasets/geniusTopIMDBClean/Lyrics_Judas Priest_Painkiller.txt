Faster than a bullet terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger hes half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated mankinds on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Oh
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured theyve been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Ah


He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Pain Pain Killer Killer
Pain Pain Killer Killer
Cant stop the Painkiller
Pain
