When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You pulled me back to earth
Dont you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that youre trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now Im a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
Im just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
Ive given up completely
Ive locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free
Dont you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that youre trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now Im a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
Im just a prisoner of your eyes


In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain
Dont you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that youre trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now Im a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
Im just a prisoner of your eyes
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now Im a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
Im just a prisoner of your eyes
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now Im a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
Im just a prisoner of your eyes
