I made a spike about nine oclock on a Saturday
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
And seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff New York fire island
I cased the joint straining at the scenes
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came agrinnin
I snapped the smile off his face and scowled Give me a bourbon
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up I saw some contact
Then the big boys saw me and knew that
Id had too much floating around
Statues alive seconds are hours
Sacks like a hurricane wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess I dream in pictures not colours
The true free expression I demand is human rights right
I gave my life I am immortal
Im going no loss
Im going no loss
Im going no loss
Im going no loss
Nightmare just a bunch of goddamn rotten steaming
Raw deal
