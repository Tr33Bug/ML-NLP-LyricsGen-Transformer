Drawn from years of self denying
Lost in chaos before the storm
Our strength goes on prepared for mortal battle
We can settle our old scores  Our old scores 
Look to the stars and challenge all of Heaven
Resist the Devil dare to dream
By grace of God within our hearts eternal
For our salvation is for everyone
Were standing as one
Were carrying on
Rising from ruins
Were bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
Well face our foes so they can hear our voices
The land rejoices in empathy
This trial by fire will build from their attrition
Its ammunition for our enemies
Were standing as one
Were carrying on
Rising from ruins
Were bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
Send in the valiant fight for what you believe
Then we shall overcome lay victory at our feet
Were standing as one
Were carrying on
Rising from ruins
We bring the lights
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
Were standing as one
Were carrying on
Rising from ruins
Were bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
