Maneating momma steamdriven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messing allin wrestling
Is one of her pride and joys
Shes a classy flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Twofaced liar full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
Shes a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninetynine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
