Screaming for Vengeance Lyrics
Ahhhhhh!

Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders, and that's not right
They're playing out a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
Always taking, baby, but that's okay
What they're giving, maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once, you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load

We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace


So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate
You might also like
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

Screaming, screaming vengeance
Screaming, vengeance, screaming1Embed
