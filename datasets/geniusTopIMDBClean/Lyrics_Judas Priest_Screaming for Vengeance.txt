Ahhhhhh
Hey listen dont you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and thats not right
Theyre playing out a game that draws you closer
Till youre living in a world thats ruled by fear
Always taking baby but thats okay
What theyre giving maybe its out of phase with me
Told you once youre never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face
We are screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then youre pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All youre praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load
We are screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I dont talk about it but thats all right
Tables turned now theres a revenge in sight
If it takes forever then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hells own gate
We are screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Screaming screaming vengeance
Screaming vengeance screaming
