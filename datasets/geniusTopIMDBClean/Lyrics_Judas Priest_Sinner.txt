Sinner rider rides in with the storm
The Devil rides beside him
The Devil is his god God help you mourn
Do you do you hear it do you hear the thunder
Deafen every living thing about
Can you can you see it can you
See the mountains darken yonder
Black sun rising time is running out
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Sinner Sinner
Is this obligation 
Sinner Sinner
His steed of fury
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze
Demonic vultures stalking
Drawn by the smell of war and pain
He roams the starways
Searching for the carcasses of war
But if its hungry then its very presence
Disrupts the calm into the storm
Curse and damn you all youll fall by the hand of the
Sinner Sinner
Desegregation 
Sinner Sinner
God of the devils god of the devils
Wont you help them pray
God of the devils god of the devils
Is there no other way


Cant you hear their souls calling out in their plight
Cant you see their blood is boiling setting them alight
Thirty years now sleeping so sound
War raises its head and looks slowly around
The sinner is near sensing the fear
And the beast will start movin around
Cant you see their souls calling out in their brain
Cant you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight
Sinner Sinner Sinner Sinner
Sinner Sinner
Sinner Sinner
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Curse and damn you all you fall by the hand of the
Sinner
