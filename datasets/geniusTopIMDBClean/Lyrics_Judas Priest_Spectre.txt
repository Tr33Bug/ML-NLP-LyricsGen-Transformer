In a league of his own
A villain with no morals
Above the law and reckless
Mutating day by day
Invisible and silence
Conspiring to get power
This man will stop at nothing
To always get his way
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
When youre mind in a vice
He twists and turns with terror
Keeps building up the pressure
Until youre feeling numb
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
The spectre creeps behind you
Shrouded by his stealth
Ignore him at your peril
He kills to heal himself
In the blink of an eye
He marks you with precision
Corrupting all he touches
Salvation in your soul
Scourging you in silence
As he makes his incision
The venoms taking over
This tyrant takes his toll


Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
Youll be frozen in fright
Like the glint of his knife
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
