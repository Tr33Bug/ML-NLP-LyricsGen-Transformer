Take These  Chains Lyrics
I move away it dont do me no good
Three thousand miles dont help like I thought it would
Help me begging you please
You got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Reach out to me as if from the grave
I tried to run but Im tied to you like a slave
Its my fault loving you so
You were so precious how could I know
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
I dont owe you anything
Why dont you get out of my life
Through it all the memories cling
And I cant sleep at night
Help me Im begging you please
You got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life
Leave me be
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
Take these chains off
Take them off from my heart
