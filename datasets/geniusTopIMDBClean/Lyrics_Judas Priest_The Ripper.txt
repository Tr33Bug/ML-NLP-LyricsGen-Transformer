Youre in for surprise
Youre in for a shock
In London town streets
When theres darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
Ill attack
I smile when Im sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when Im creeping
But you wont hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the Ripper
Youll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if Im near
Im sly and Im shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for the Ripper
Or if you like Jack the Knife
Any back alley street
Is where well probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the airs cold and damp
Im a nasty surprise
Im a devil in disguise
Im a footstep at night
Im a scream at the sight
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the Ripper
The Ripper
The Ripper
