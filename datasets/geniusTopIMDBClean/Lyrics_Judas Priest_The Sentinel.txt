Along deserted avenues steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready prepared for quick surprise
Hes watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade all fear the Sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell a cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade all fear the Sentinel
Amidst the upturned burnedout cars the challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars with which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest the rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests have finished many lives
Now facing one another the standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls as the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers with shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory and the seeds of death hes sown
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade all fear the Sentinel
