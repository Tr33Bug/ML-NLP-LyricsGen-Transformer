You wont hear me but youll feel me
Without warning somethings dawning listen
Then within your senses
Youll know youre defenseless
How your heart beats when you run for cover
You cant retreat I spy like no other
Then well race together
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me
Im your turbo lover
Tell me theres no other
Im your turbo lover
Better run for cover
We hold each other closer
As we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by
With every nerve alive
We move so fast it seems as though
Weve taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony
We hear the engines cry
Im your turbo lover
Tell me theres no other
Im your turbo lover
Better run for cover
On and on were charging
To the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity
Of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven
In this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment
We shatter and explode


Im your turbo lover
Tell me theres no other
Im your turbo lover
Better run for cover
Im your turbo lover
Tell me theres no other
Im your turbo lover
Better run for cover
