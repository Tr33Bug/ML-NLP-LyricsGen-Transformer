Whiskey woman dont you know that you are drivin me insane
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain
Dont you know youre driving me insane
Youre tryin to find your way through life
Youre tryin to get some new direction
Another womans got her man
But she wont find no new connection
Takes another drink or two
Things look better when shes through
Take another look around youre not going anywhere
Youve realized youre gettin old and no one seems to care
Youre tryin to find your way again
Youre tryin to get some new
Another womans got her man
But she wont get a new oh
Takes another drink or two
Things look better when shes through
Youve been foolin with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up get out you know you really blew it
Ive had enough Ive had enough good God pluck me
Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mine  Once she was mine 
Change has come over her body
She doesnt see me anymore
Now change has come over her body
She doesnt see me anymore
Changes
Changes
Changes
Changes
Victim of changes
No no no
No
