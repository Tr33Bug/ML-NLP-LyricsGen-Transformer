One life Im gonna live it up
Im takin flight I said Ill never get enough
Stand tall Im young and kinda proud
Im on top as long as the musics loud
If you think Ill sit around as the world goes by
Youre thinkin like a fool cause its a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin to be had
If you think Ill let it go youre mad
Youve got another thing comin
Youve got another thing comin
Thats right heres where the talkin ends
Well listen this night therell be some action spent
Drive hard Im callin all the shots
I got an ace card comin down on the rocks
If you think Ill sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I aint foolin and youd better think again
Out there is a fortune waitin to be had
If you think Ill let it go youre mad
Youve got another thing comin
Youve got another thing comin
Youve got another thing comin
In this world were livin in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is dont give in aim for a new tomorrow

Hey Im a big smash Im goin for infinity yeah
If you think Ill sit around as the world goes by
Youre thinkin like a fool cause its a case of do or die
Out there is a fortune waitin to be had
If you think Ill let it go youre mad
