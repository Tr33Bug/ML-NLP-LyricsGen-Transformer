Just put a picture up on Instagram
Now Im in the kitchen whipping Instagrams
Im getting money nigga blog that
Your girl wanna fuck me nigga blog that
You a hater eat a dick nigga blog that
I just bought another whip nigga blog that
Im back tell the motherfucking blogs that
And Im bout to pop it off bra strap
Fresh off my hiatus fresh off my hiatus
Santana back in business now lets get reacquainted
Im that nigga AKA not the one to play with
Im all these bitches favorite
Im flyer than your planets
Big gun where my waist is
Screaming out hi haters
All you niggas targets Im just shooting Im not aiming
Still whipping that Katy still whipping that Katy
Perry till she ready then I pass it Tom Brady
Twenty bands in the rubber band
On my neck about one hundred grand
Blood diamonds like I just came from the motherland
Told you niggas Id be up again
Fly up or get flown over
Swag up or get swagged on
Boss up or get bossed around
We dont cuff hoes they get passed on
Bad bitches I got that
Big money I got that
Four doors coupes with the top back I got that
Still keep that big thing and that thingll blow your top back
Who said they gon take something We right here they aint take nothing
Fall back or get flat lined
Red beam on that black nine
Cold steel with these hot shells you talk shit and I back mine
I ball even when its halftime
Your bitch call its that time
Im lit like a candle she tryna get her wax on
If it aint the Rari its the Bentley Mussolini
Or the Phantom or the Ghost wondering if they can see me
Hash tag my bitch bad
Hash tag my jewels real
Hash tag my pockets fat
And thats cause I just made a sale
Hash tag my clique kill
Your bitch think Im a big deal
Fucked up with my Js on hit her with that windmill
