Blunt full of that Buddha
Car full of them shooters
Bad chick from Bermuda
But my Brazilian girl even cuter
She drop down to her knees like I dont do this all the time
And thats when I reply
Girl you know you lyin
I looked right in her eyes and said girl you know you fine
She said men think with they penis
So I told her blow my mind
That foreign car parked outside
She know that shit is mine
And a real nia son like me
She know thats hard to find
I pulled up Im turnt up
No I dont wait on no line
That Jesus piece that cuban link
Versace shades on my eyes
Now I know how BIG felt
Im strapped boy no seat belt
You a bitch nigga yeah a female
Im a G male no Email
Still got that comeback
Wholesale and retail
Im riding on that money train
And I dont wanna be derailed
I dont pop them mollies
But I know that she will
Im high up that weed smell
And that codeine got me ill
45 on my hip 45 on my wrist
2 45 for my whip now thats what I call lick
Vegas night roulette table lost 45 in one spin
Im a harlem nigga I double duck bet 45 again
Lost that made it right back in a 45 minute trip
Nigga wanted to and I fronted 2 charging 45 each brick
Nigga you road boat and Im show boat
And youre joe rogan Im hulk hogan
My car foreign next season
You jet skiing my jet leaving
And I brought your girl with me
She a zombie she be head eating
Wanna see a movie come see me
Fuck hd Im 3d
What I smoke be 1 hunned
And Im 300 like chief keef
Screaming oh I bang bang you know the drill
Overkill
Fly up or get flown over
Swag up or get swagged on
Boss up or get bossed around
We dont cuff hoes they get passed on
Bad bitches I got that
Big money I got that
Four doors coupe   top back I got that
Still keep that big thing and that thingll blow your top back
Who said they gon take something We right here they aint take nothing
Fall back or get flat lined
Red beam on that black nine
Cold steel with these hot shells you talk shit and I back mine
