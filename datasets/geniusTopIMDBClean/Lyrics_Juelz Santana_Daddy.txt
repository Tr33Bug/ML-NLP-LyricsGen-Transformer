Daddy Damn man this shit is crazy
Got a lil son now a lil me
Runnin around this is crazy
Ill do anything man anything
Life is precious remember that
and if I die then my child will be a bastard 
I just had a new born
Shorty weigh 7 pounds 6 ouches 20 inches to strong
Im happy now
Im a daddy now
I gotta be there I aint get to see my daddy round
We aint never get to ball out kid
I was young the game caught him before I did
But back to you son as for you son
I do any and everythin thats the truth son
From the dirtiest diaper till you get old enough to dirty your Nikes up
Im your clean up man if you ever need a hand need a foot need a heart
Need a lung
Reach for the phone call me up son
Yes everything drops for you everything stops for you
I burry a block for you I let go every shot for you
And I reload the clip just to make sure hes hit
I got a lil boy to look after
I got a lil boy to look after
I got a lil boy to look after
And if I die my child will be a bastard
I got a lil boy to look after

And if I die my child will be a bastard
Everyday I look in ya face
I sit back and I smile look at his face its just like mine
Wow damn this kid shines
Authority and priority this kid mines
So that means I have to beat him if I have to
Keep him out of bad schools
Teach him how to rap smooth
Show him the ropes like make sure his ropes tight
No screws loose no loose screws
Got manners got morals god sense respect
Cause when you gone boy thats all you got left
You ever get craves for candy dont take a strangers candy
Open a strangers candy those are the strangest candies
Im ya rider ya guider plus ya provider but most of all ya father and Im jus
Lookin out for you
When theres a problem Im just lookin out for you
I aint talkin man Im just pullin out for you
The four the sword the hood will come out for you
And what Im about to do you shouldnt go out and do
Jus make sure you good to me and good to moms
Respect your elders youll grow to be good and strong
I got a lil boy to look after
I got a lil boy to look after
I got a lil boy to look after
And if I die my child will be a bastard
I got a lil boy to look after
I got a lil boy to look after
I got a lil boy to look after
And if I die my child will be a bastard
I placed you up in the sky
Like behold the only thing greater than I
You my greatest achievement
Fuck a platinum plaque
This is history in the making believe in it
Without you I cant make or succeed in shit
I cant think I cant wake up and eat shit
You the reason that Im breathin
And Ill stop at any moment to see this child live a better life
Wow its a better life but you better throw down if you ever fight
Like rocky do
Dont be no punk when its time to get up and put on you boxin shoes
You lace em up tight you fall get up and fight
You lose o well we all lose some fights
Jus be a man about yours life is all about handlin yours so you just keep
Handlin yours
I got a lil boy to look after

And if I die my child will be a bastard

I got a lil boy to look after
And if I die my child will be a bastard
