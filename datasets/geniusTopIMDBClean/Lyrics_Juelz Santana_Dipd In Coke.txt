La musica de Harry Fraud

Ooh got to have it got to have it
A thousand thread count come and check out the fabric
Purple city purple drink Lenny Kravitz

Bitches love Paris so I take em to the Hilton
Yes yall I stay fresh yall
Lifes a chess board but for this dough I play Connect 4
Check after check I collect tryna collect more
And for a check you get checked off
Lifes cheap dont get bought
Lifes a bitch moneys an escort
Import export tailor made cut from the best cloth
Balmain on niggas more than flexed us
Santana back to pick up where I left off
Yall niggas know me
I was the best before the best was
And now Im back for what they owe me
Lil boy fresh all grown up
Pot clickin still turning the stove up yup
Lil nigga still dripped in gold
Thousand gram kilos like Im dipped in coke
Fuck school I aint like it
My mother said she want more from me
Not going she said that youre a pure dummy
Instead Im trafficking in traffic out in cross country
Dear mama your son turned to a floss junky
So I stepped into the ballpark
Coke I franchised like Walmart
Sold it to the law lawyers judges and mall cops
Got it any occassion nigga Im Hallmark
So yes yall yes yes yall
No need to guess Im flee thats fresh yall
I said yes yall yes yes yall
Montana know you fuckin with the best yall
I said yes yall yes yes yall
Santana know you fuckin with the best yall
