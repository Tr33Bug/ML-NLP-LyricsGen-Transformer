Oh wait who the fuck I think Im fooling
I just feel like my damn self
Call Jahlil up
Told em sample Drake Voice make that my anthem
Im Hype Williams with a handheld
Bobby Brown with a handscale
Yall niggas on a treadmill
Just runnin at a stand still
Im that motherfucking nigga homie thats just something that I cant help
All these sucker MCs thats just something that I cant feel
Was I with your bitch last night thats just something that I cant tell
Gotta fuck with niggas doing better
Cant fuck with niggas doing lesser
All these fake niggas doing extra
Til you put them underneath some pressure
Its like niggas in a rat race they tryna see who can tell the fastest
Tell em niggas go that way that or they momma picking out caskets
I done gave so much help out
Niggas dont appreciate shit
So its time to help myself out
These niggas always gon forget
Its 2017 nigga everbody giddy up all bets took
Triple double on these niggas every night got me feeling like Westbrook
Got the basics on em like a textbook
Getting to the money smoking best kush
I aint worried bout none of you niggas
Im just worried bout how my checks look
My new bitch she the baddest so I aint worried bout how my ex look
But Ive seen a picture of that bitch
And she got that my lifes a mess look
All these fucking Twitter threats you gon kill this you gon injure that
Like the police aint got the internet
Man real niggas aint into that
When its real nigga we getting into that
No chitter chat we come through
Hate shit you still talking we spinning back getting rid of that
Niggas better chill life cheap on the block
Where we from we see a lot
Niggas get popped tryna be who they not
Niggas dont know how to dress
No stylist I be all kinda fresh
Im a big fiend for Amaury jeans cause they fit good and the pockets stretch
Big wad and the small tool on me yeah nigga thats my pocket wrench
Leap frog I hopped the fence
Like you aint got no fucking common sense
And Ima start busting on your ass like I aint got no fucking kinda sense
Aw man they aint ready for me
Aw man they aint ready for me
Probably got your bitch somewhere butt naked bout to get ready for me
Had to cut a lot of niggas off but I realize they was never for me
You tryna get that right now paper Im tryna get that forever money
Just a nigga with a attitude tryna get that Jerry Heller money
Im ruthless in the booth bitch
Ice on lights on Im too lit
Car cool whip and the roof lift
Forgiatos offset it
Bowlegged how the coupe sit
Here that boy go stunting again yeah Im back on my bullshit
