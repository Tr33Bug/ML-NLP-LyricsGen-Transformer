God will never put you in a situation that you cant handle
But you can definitely put yourself in a situation you cant handle
And some situations lead to death
Death is a mothafuckerya dig
Old timer want the block back stop that
You been gone too long the young nigga said
Lord knows whats going through this young niggas head
As the old timer stood and grilled him
Peeled off shorty looked at his man
Touched his burner like I shouldve killed him
Shorty in deep but he dont care
But he dont know these old timers dont play fair Nah 
There he go postin on his strip again
Toast on him niggas with him posted on his shit again
UhOh  He acting like it cant and it wont happen
Old Timer bout to blow dust off that old cabinet
DustDustDust  Where them guns is kept
These young niggas better show some respect  respect 
Ill teach em a lesson he said to his self
As he proceeded to pull the lead from his shelf
Now he headed towards Shorty block forty cocked
On his zip on his shit like he dont care who Shorty wit
But somebody saw him before he got to Shorty
Shorty phone ring somebody called him
Somebody warned him Hes coming hes coming
Shorty replied Somebody stall him
Then he crept up wit his goons and guns
Whispered in the Old Timers ear deaths soon to come
They say hell is hot
Well is heaven cold
Know one ever knows til you Gone gone gone
And when you gone does your soul drift off to a better place
Or do you just forever fade
Awayawayawayawaylike a bird when its headed towards the sky huh
Or do you just die huh
Or do you just perish from the earth and if so why
Baddest bitch up on the block
Probably make a nigga cum as soon as she get up on the cock
She fuck with Tony dont she  dont she 
Oh hes not your average drug dealer fa sho hes
Being watched by police feds
Investigators ohcant forget the haters
Homegirl aint got a clue what he do for a living
She just think she got a dude with a pension
She dont know this dude is a henchman
And he moves on dudes with the cruelest intentions
All she know she got a brand new Benz
And its big enough for her and all her brand new friends  Damn 
There she go all through the street with it
Dude in and outta town she all through the street with it
We all know the street talk we all know the street listen
Next day shes missing
music stops phone rings twice 
man speaks Hello
man on phone Hey nigga I got yo bitch Have a million sent up or she dead
music resumes 
Damnshe in deep shit and she did nothing
I bet you she aint see this coming but he did
Cause he did nothing he aint pay  pay 
He told em keep that bitch he okay
He got a wife and a kid back home
And he dont care about the life that she live  Damn 
Now thats wrong  wrong 
But the story aint over it drags on  aw man what happened next 
They wind up beating her down
Breathless he winds up fleeing the town to the next bitch
And um I say that to say this a lot of people dont appreciate life until theyre gone
I mean a lot of situations can be avoided you just gotta avoid em ya dig
These are just a few stories mantheres a lot more where they come from
Just dont be one of them people Im talking bout ya know
