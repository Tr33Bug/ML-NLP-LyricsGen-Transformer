Face numb taste some
Fiends come back for this here
Grade A A1
And one like the ball players
Everything I cook come back and some
Im a boss player
I cook good make it look good damn straight
Put coke in the pot take out pancakes
Double stacks triple stacks why not
I got that syrup too just call me iHop
Yes I been involved with killas
You know cold hearted niggas narcotic dealers
Yes you ever seen a chick straight from Colombia
Shit dope out clean it taste it in front of ya
But the dope flow was slow in my area
The coke flow was woah in my area
And woah meant dough in my area
You know I sold that woah like woah in my area woah
po po in my area
Gotta get low from my area
What I do I gave a chick a BBT
A brick and a bus ticket then she meets me  where 
New town same plan shut it down
New grounds same land Columbus found
American dreams American fiends
I got to get money by any American means
Now thats an American Idol
Hustla soldier bearing his rifle when the wars on
Well the wars on call off backup
Fore all yall wind up all gone
BLOCKA The four long leave big holes
The size of windows doctors cant stitch closed
I get this cake get it straight
I pick up 2 bricks a day thats what I call lifting weights
All while tryna dodge prison gates
I refuse to get caught be a number of the state
Im trynna have a number every state
And a place I can lay when I come through every state
Im straight
Got it down packed pack down shorty
You late still using that black ground coffee
My car smelling like mustard
That aint what I ate boy thats just how I smuggle it
Buss it
Got 2 bricks in the front 2 bricks in the back
Thats four bricks riding with me in this Cadillac
But Im more of an out of town nigga
Long as I know some out of town niggas Im good there
Yea I dont wait for paper I locate the paper
Then go chase the paper there I go
Stay focused any place Im strapped in
Cause niggas get killed for delayed reactions
So one late reaction youll be laid and packed in
That casket
