Lets Go  From Me to U  Lyrics
Ive been really trying baby
Trying to hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Cmon ohhhh cmon woo
Lets get it on
Lets get it on nigga
Aww man lets get it on man
Santana you on ya own man
Hold the set down
We can get it on
Lets do it man Dipset
We got these bastards man lets do it
Uh you niggas dealing with a G from the block
Yeah its me from the block
Quick to tell a nigga lets get it on
But I dont really like to beef on the block
That brings heat to the block
I got to eat on the block nigga
Yeah you dealing with a pimp from the hood
Keep a chick from the hood
Quick to tell her ay lets get it on
Come on lets go
Im trying to do it so ay lets get it on
Im one hell of a guy
Fly pelican fly
Like Scarface one hell of a high shit
One hell of a ride that I drive
23s look like propellers on side
Who stunting like me
Who fronting like me
Who did it Who get it
Who done it like me You
Who wishing Who fronting Who want it from me You
Come get it you want it its nothing to me
And you chumps already know how I feel
When it comes to the pump and the steel
Its like lets get it on


You know what these wild boys tote
Tie em up with the cowboy ropes
So lets get it on
Hey ma back that ass up
Looking back  almost crashed up
So lets get it on
Man you dudes can get it
Thats my word to the slant on my Houston fitted
I send rockets at you dudes and midgets
Send cock up in you goose and pigeons
So lets get it on
I know you like that mama
Ill be right back mama
So lets get it on
Yeah do you believe me
Dont you believe me
Wont you believe me
Come lets get it on
On any given Sunday or any given Monday
We headed up the runway
Uptown yeah we headed up a oneway
Her head is in my lap
So I let her do her one thing
She was Jamaican so I fed her bread and dumplings
Veggie pads and rum cake
Told her lets get it on
Said shes 18 and lived crazy just like me
80s baby just like me so lets get it on
Hey baby you know what your boy holds
All night long pipe long strokeslets get it on
Hey ma roll with the winners
And I aint talking dinner
Im like lets get it on
Man I roll through stroll through
Flag on the ride side of my whole crew
Screaming lets get it on
Theyll get you theyll twist you
Theyll split your whole body in half then dismiss you
Like lets get it on
But Im looking for a bad lil mama
Get mad like her papa got an ass like her mama
Got her own wont ask for a dollar
Go half on a scama and I laugh when I holla lets get it on
Hey baby the ride on this chrome
Just provide us with dome so lets get it on
You must be used to me spending
Hey ma if you give good brain youll get your Dipset chain
Lights out nothing to fight bout
Got the pipe out so lets get it on
Its the only thing to do I mean its only right
