This story starts off
Little boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does its back to the ghetto  ghetto 
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto so he adapts to the ghetto
Yes the crack and the metal
He takes no days off for gettin his cocaine off  off 
He ran back and fourth so much it pissed Jose off  Psssss 
Now Jose was the cocaine boss  boss 
Straight from Columbia his cocaine soft  soft 
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off cuz he had love for his sister  Take that Take that 
And shorty had no love for his sister
Cuz his sister would sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for em both
Plus he was good at handlin coke so Jose liked him
Problem was he was pitchin for the dudes down the street  Who 
You know TJ Big Boo and Malik  Word 
Malik is a killer Boo is a killer  Yep

But despite the fact  what  they didnt like the fact
That he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And being that he was a pitcher here in the winter air  What happened 
They set it up to get him there and hit him there  Damn 
But shorty was smart
So before they got to load and spark
He said hold up my heart  Hold up hold up  Please
Then he said please look up in my bag  Look 
Theres cook up in my bag its all good up in my bag  Here 
And theres more where that came from

They let him go yeah thinkin he would let em know  What 
Where Jose was keepin that heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that  Bout that 
And we all know Jose bout that  Bout that 
Next thing you know he seen Jose slouch back  What 
In the chair like Theres no way out that  Nope 
He said Shoot em Imma blow they house back  Back 
Next day he sent the two way out town  And 
And somebody blew they house down  Damn
