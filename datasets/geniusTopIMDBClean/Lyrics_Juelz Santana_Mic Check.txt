I been paying attention to whats going on out there man  yep 
I been watching you niggas stealing my ways and shit  uhhuh 
And its getting out of control now  out of control 
Imma telling you dudes like I tell my woman  listen 
Dont watch me watch TV This is payperview you gotta pay for this Aye
First let me take time to brush my shoulders off
WaitI had to dust my shoulders off
Thanks yall been waiting been patient been anxious
Now I herefore bring back me your greatness  yes 
The rap Ali jab I weave
Then come back with the same jab times three
I blow smoke to the heaven Im so close to perfection
Raps one big casino Im plotting Ocean Eleven  ay 
I might have sold the least
But I still manage to be most feared by most emcees  good 
Who holding me Who close to me
For sho papi nobody yeah thats how its supposed to be
Now listen you can either comprehend it or compliment it
Its all authentic  yep 
But you better believe whatever I say
Guess what you can bet it all I meant it  AYE 
Mic check one two one two  one two 
Mic check one two one two  one two 
Mic check one two what is this
Santanas back to business lets go  ay 
Mic check one two one two  check 
Mic check one two one two  check 
Mic check one two what is this
Santanas back to business lets go
Verse 2
Bad news rap dudes Im back fools
Give the thrown up this is that jack move  jack move 
Hachoo I just sneezed and the track moved  hachoo 
God bless me yes thats true
So bright throw lights up for me
For life married the game throw rice up for me  yes 
So nice throw ice up for me  yes 
Two pieces for BIG and one piece for tha kid  yes 
I am back yup put a stack up
Let it down set it down now Im bout to act up
For you to get rid of me youll need about 50 Gs
In army fatigues ready to bleed please believe  Wow 
If you catch me pushing a whip
Its a new coupe wit a lip
Or something foreign Ill never forget
Yes Im the man bet Im the man
Am I here to save the day Oh yes I definitely am


Look homie quick homie
Get a camera get a flick  yes 
Get a load of this homie
I spit homie the flow so sick homie
Once again Im back this is it homie
The albums done which mean the albums coming
Spent a while but  fuck  it
This time around Im fronting
I done styled and stunted
I done wild in public I done paid my dues
Did my hundred miles and running Now Im back  ay
