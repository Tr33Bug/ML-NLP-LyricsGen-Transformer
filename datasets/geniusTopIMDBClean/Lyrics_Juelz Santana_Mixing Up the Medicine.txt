Im on the pavement thinking about the government
Santanas in the basement mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Yo Juelz what it is 
Ive been mixing up the medicine
Your games looking sick 
Im deliverin the medicine
I been in the lab like a chemist just developin
My potion now its potent time to hit em in the head again
Knock knock pow pow its Santana let him in
I got what you need tell a friend to tell a friend
If a label need a hit if a fiend need a fix
Or if a chick just need some good dick I got the  medicine 
You boys shipping whack drops
Yall should be mascots
Come and see the splash doc
Ill give you a swag shot
Fuck what you hearin you should listen
This is rap penicillin
Still in the kitchen  mixing mixing medicine 
Young splash and Im back in the building
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Whatever he said times that by gazillion
And thats only half of how Im feeling
I been  mixing up the medicine 
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Mixing up the medicine
Mixing up the medicine
I was in the basement mixing up the medicine
I get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Get jail jump bail
Join the army if you fail
Lights camera action Im feeling fantastic
Flyer than a pair of wings flappin
Take my picture
You a freak Im a freak
You going home take me with ya
Ill look at your baby pictures
But I wont have no baby with ya
Back up or ya heard me
Back up or ya head me
Im ballin like the 80s so James Worthy
Still makin money off the white girl Fergie
I aint a new boy so they know they cant jerk me
No limit how I get it call me Percy
Miller Im a killer no mercy
And Im so dope youd think Frank Lucas served me
So hot fire couldnt burn me
Bitches wanna nurse me
Take her out and trick around
I take her home and dick her down
Send her back to you like
Baby I was at my sisters house
Yall nigga remember me
Im every rappers enemy
Cuz they know once I get the lead
Youll never get ahead of me
Swagger on rooftops
And Ones new Glock
You wanna get loud youll get blastedboombox
Attitude like 2Pac when Juice dropped
Still go to the dealer with the money in a shoe box
This wasnt supposed to come out
This wasnt supposed to come out
They let that new drug out
They let that new drug out
My niggas bout to dumb out
My ladies bout to bug out
And if her body crazy Im a take her to the nut house
You lames aint interesting
The games been missing this
Niggas full of sugar and I came with the insulin
Whatevers your addiction
I got your prescription
I get it how I live it
And Im loving every minute
You got that shit that just came out that new new
I got that shit that aint came out its too new
Im so intriguing youre girls so deceiving
Im so exciting and shes so conniving
