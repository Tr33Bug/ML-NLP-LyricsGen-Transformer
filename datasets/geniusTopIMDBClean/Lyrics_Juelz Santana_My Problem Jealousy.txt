My Problem  Jealousy  Lyrics
Im sorry I mean it too
Let me talk to you
Knahmsayin Tell you what it was all about maybe
Jealousy 
We was in love it had to be the  Jealousy 
That had me buggin all for nuttin  Jealousy yeah 
Now Im a loner cause of  Jealousy yeah 
Im sorry man oh
Baby all I wanted was a chance with you
Little love little dance romance with you
Shit I had big plans for you
Swear to God I never meant to put my hands on you
Thats not somethin that a manll do
Thats not somethin I had plans to do I had plans to move
Take you with me give you the Coupe
Give you the shoes instead I was hearin the news
You was out there buggin fuckin
Doin your dirt when I was in the studio workin
Shit Im tryna make music thats perfect
Instead I gotta hear you out there foolin and flirtin
You and your friends got a bad reputation already
If Im not mistaken alreadyuh
But I gotta pologize to your mother and father
Shoulda never put my hands on your daughter
But I aint askin you to drop no charges shit
I did what I did deserve the consequence
I cant see myself coppin a plea
To one of these niggas who bleed the same as me
Im a G I will cock and squeeze
The same as he take it to the same degree please
So lets leave it alone we dont need this at home
Especially all over some fuckin
Jealousy yeah  yeah thats what its about right
Jealousy yeah  I never meant to touch you
Jealousy yeah 
Uh it was the  Jealousy yeah 
I was buggin high  Jealousy yeah 
Whoa  Jealousy yeah 
God forgive me my  Jealousy yeah 
If I could take it back  Jealousy yeah 
You know I would yes I would yes I would
Shit now I dont know what made me lift my hand up
Swing it at you I musta been crazy
Musta been high twisted off hazy
Fuck am I doing This is my baby
And now Im feeling like Kane from Menace II Society
Know your brothers wanna come back and fire at me
Now Im ridin with my riders beside of me
Cant get caught slippin so they ridin beside of me
And Cam told me not to fuck with you
He told me you known the blocks corrupted you
I told him nah I had it locked threw cuffs on you
Plus I had lots of love for you huh
So Im stickin with my heart thats my nigga to the heart
But Im stickin with my heart
Now look Im sittin in the dark
Facin a charge gotta go sit up in a court
All because I was stupid and dumb
Shoulda never went through it with hun shit
But to this day I never knew this would come
I never thought that I would go through this with hun no
The one I wanted to marrywanted to carry my baby through life
Maybe this life we cant be together
Cant see together cant see each other
Dont need each other wont be together cause
Jealousy yeah  uh huh
Jealousy yeah 
Damn  Jealousy yeah  why did we have to go through this  Jealousy yeah 
And its all because of this  Jealousy yeah 
I admit I was  Jealousy yeah 
Jealousy yeah 
Uh you was playin them games too  Jealousy yeah 
Sayin them names too
