Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They cant understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I cant give up they dont know what Im going through
They dont understand what Ive been through
They dont understand what I go through
You think everythings all good but you only see what I show you
They dont understand that boss life gotta take care of my whole crew
My whole crew my whole crew  they depend on me my fuckin niggas
They know the love is real and Im a fuckin winner
We all gon eat Sunday dinner
One day we broke together next day we rich forever
One day we broke together next day we rich forever
They hate it when you up they love it when you down
All we got is us then told my niggas look around
Look around look around
If I gotta be the one to lift us up I wont let em down
So at the top its just us looking down
Sorry I delayed us but we gon get this paper
Had a couple issues I dealt with them now its payback
Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They cant understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I cant give up they dont know what Im going through
Its like everybody got they hand out
Actin like they you owe em something
They expect you to throw em something
When they really need you to show em something
One month youre broke again
Actin like you aint throw em none
Ungrateful ass niggas they only love you when you giving
And the day you say you aint got it they forget the days that you did it
You forgot me when I was losin so forget me when Im winnin
Where the dark day was frenzing me til the day they be friended me
One day we broke friends next day we rich enemies
Its hard being a real nigga when these niggas got bitch tendencies
Female emotions I cant waste my energy
For them I got that remedy kill em with success
Royalty is my pedigree too fresh to be stressed
But thank god for memories god willin Im blessed
My comebacks they penalty these haters gon be upset
And I done lost a couple friends on the way
Fuck em they wasnt really with me all the way  Ill be okay
Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They cant understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I cant give up dont know what Im going through
