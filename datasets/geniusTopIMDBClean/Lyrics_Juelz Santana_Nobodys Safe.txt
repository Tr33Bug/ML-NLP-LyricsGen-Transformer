Aint nobody safe
Aint nobody safe
Aint nobody safe
Aint nobody safe
Tell everybody aint nobody safe
Get to banging at his body till the shotty break
Bitch Im the shit thats what that potty say
Back to killing niggas the John Gotti way
Everybody dead put me on a warning poster
Chopper got me feeling like Im on a roller coaster
Big body Bentley big booty bitch Im so used to this
I smelled so much coke aroma I done got used to it
Murder rate we the ones boosting it
Murder rate we the ones boosting it
Take money we dont wait to get it
School of hard knocks soft niggas gotta pay tuition
Everyday stunting boy thats how Im living
Smoking dope counting money fucking bitches
Court side at the Knick game faded
And the way I ball for real I feel like I should be playing
Back to killing niggas
Aint nobody safe
Fucking all they bitches
Aint nobody safe
Still gang affiliated
Aint nobody safe
Mask on my face
Aint nobody safe
Step up in the club light show
Next thing you know you looking round like whered your wife go
She with us but only for the night though
I say she with us but only for the night though
All the real niggas over here bitch
So who the fuck you over there with
Yall niggas know once we go to work
Kill a nigga then go to church
Living life fast Im counting my blessings
Cause when you getting paid you gotta pay attention
Talk like a boss move like a king
Five karats on the pinky make them niggas kiss the rings
Bling plow all in your face nigga
And Imma make sure murder be the case nigga
Cause I know you be singing songs no Trey nigga
Your girl wanna play so Imma play with her


You the type to snitch and tattle shit
Tell them snakes I rattle shit
I bring the submarine around and flip your battleship
Get cut down to fractions and ripped to fragments
Your girl wanna fuck me whollah magic stick
She drown and I wont save her but Ill give her my paddle stick
Chill Im ill somebody call paramedics
Pull up in hot whips push up on hot chicks
Then we just dip just like calisthenics
Getting so much money I aint tryna count it
But I love my money so I gotta count it
And the my killers aint with me they a call away
So when youre talking to a boss nigga know your place
