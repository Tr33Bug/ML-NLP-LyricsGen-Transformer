Juelz Santana Aint no turning back from here 
I am sicker than Sick Wid It
DONT listen just picture it
HOW vivid this picture is
ME gifted and living this
NO gimmicks or images
I spit and deliver it
LIKE no one thats living shit 
Straight from the ground you dig
Close to where the groundhogs live
Where the police hound yall kids
Arrest and give out long bids
From where they keep the four squeeze the four
Hustle all day in the streets so long
If the feds ever decide to come
We all going down on a motherfucking RICO law
I was taught be smart stay humble
I was taught be hard dont fumble
I was taught in this concrete jungle
Rumble young man rumble
I was taught stay hard as they come dude
I was taught any problems confront you
I was taught in this concrete jungle
Rumble young man rumble
Greater than great I am
YES haters they hate I am
WHAT playing I play to win
PLUS still I remain up in
THE hood I came up in
BUT the hood I came up in
FUCKED since Bush done came up in YUP 
From my date of birth hun
Til my day in the dirt come
I remain the earths one
YES the matrixs first son
Toast to the good days to the bad days
To the good yay to the bad yay
To the time the shit was mixed up
I had good yay on a bad day
Best of the best I is
AND never the less I is
AYE man of respect I is
REAL dammit yes I is
KILL nigga yes I will
LEAVE bodies by cemeteries
HES forever buried
HOW by any means necessary
Im here to promise to keep my vows in order
Im here to promise to keep my child in order
Til the day I get locked
Til the day I get shot
Or till the day I just drown in water 
Dont feel sorry for me have a party for me
Bitches balloons Bacardi and weed
And let niggas know that I died with a heart of a G
