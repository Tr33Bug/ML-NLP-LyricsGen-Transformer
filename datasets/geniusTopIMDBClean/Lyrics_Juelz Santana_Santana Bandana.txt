Santana Back he got the bandana back
Santana back he got the bandana back
That is a fact that is a Fendi Santana back its a wrap its a rizzy  Ooh 
I keep the strap yeah the strizzy could be the mac or the dilly
The 9 only come out to shoot my Shy Glizzy
Any given day might have a brick stashed in the stizzy
Deebo back to ZBoin niggas been on my grizzly
Leg hanging out the Phantom you heard drizzy  I feel like Juelz Santana leg hanging out the Phan 
Bumpin Litty again word to Meek Milly
Till they kill me or come get me
Still balling what up Jimmy Been rich just trying to get filthy
All my whips foreign and the colors milky
Teachers used to tell the other kids not to fuck with me  Why 
Hes a dummy hes bad company
Now my teachers kids looking up to me same teacher texting me like do you want some company
She let me fuck her brains out now how dumb is she  Ha 
You know i hit it and quit it on a mission to get it this life im living is forbidden
So I stay gripping and wit it get caught slipping you finished
Gotta watch these niggas cuz they switching like bitches
With this piece im like a barber with clippers all these carnival niggas
Stick to the business only honorable niggas
Yeah there is only respect violence gotta harm a few niggas
Gotta play dumb sometimes just to be smarter than niggas
We was set up to fail from the beginning niggas go to school just to get stuck paying tuition
Drug game different niggas pieces aint hitting
Let the gram tell it though everybody winning
These boys dont listen they dont respect tradition
Niggas start shit get bombed on and start snitching
Cops kill a nigga get aquitted in a minute
And they try to bribe vision and make us think the murderers the victim
And slaves to the system its just the world we live in
