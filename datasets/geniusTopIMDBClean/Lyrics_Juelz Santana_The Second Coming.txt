I mean even though we stand alone we stand together
Ladies  gentlemen prepare for landing
Fasten your seat belts thank you for flying Air Force Airlines
Oh and me call me the captain Just Blaze
They say family that prays together stays together
And one that walks apart just falls apart
So together we stand divided we fall
United we form Voltron and take on all  Lets move 
Yes the birds left the nest
Im all grown up I gotta fly with the rest  Uhhuh 
Best of the best is what we strive to be  Yeah 
A legacy is what we tryin to leave  Ay ya dig 
Lets say goodbye to the past  Why 
The futures here at last  At last 
The second coming the new beginning  Yeah 
The truth is speaking  Uhhuh  you should listen
So glorious victorious
We take what we want we born warriors  Ay 
So glorious victorious
We take what we want we born warriors  Ay 
If you fall get up and try it again  Uhhuh 
If you drop get up and try it again  Uhhuh 
If you fall get up and try it again  Uhhuh 
If you drop get up and try it again
We tired of being runners up we coming up
We ready for whatever you put in front of us
Blood sweat and tears yeah
We dripped all three just to get here
No longer will I wake up and my dreams just vanish
Its staring right at me I must take advantage
Hard work pays off you get what you put in
So why stop now Gotta keep pushing
We in the fight til the finish so why not fight til youre finished
Dig it Im my own author heres my story
My lifes been full of pain now wheres my glory  Ay 
So glorious victorious
We take what we want we born warriors  Ay 
So glorious victorious
We take what we want we born warriors  Ay 
If you fall get up and try it again  Uhhuh 
If you drop get up and try it again  Uhhuh 
If you fall get up and try it again  Uhhuh 
If you drop get up and try it again
