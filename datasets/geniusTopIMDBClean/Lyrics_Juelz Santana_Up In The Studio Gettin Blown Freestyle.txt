Up In The Studio Gettin Blown  Freestyle  Lyrics
Im just cut from a different cloth
And they dont make this fabric no more
That money coming Im grabbin it all
Triple beam leaning still balancing raw
Still got the white Macklemore
Car seat smelling like I just ripped the packing off
Run down on me in traffic Im backin em off
Sex money and murder mastered it all
Shout out to my macs but Im Billy though
Still on that gangland shit really though
Got a couple locs that Im close with
And theyll Shmurda dance on your whole shit
Free Bobby free Rowdy free the whole 9
Free Duski free Chewie free my old Ys
Act up we at your neck like bowties
Belly shit bringing niggas gifts in a whole 9
Might send your woman crush on a road trip
That pussy stuffed with a whole brick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
She dont smoke weed but she blow dick
Buy it by the pounds smoking by the zip
Buy em by the rounds shoot em by the clip
Everybody down everybody hit
I said everybody down everybody hit
Nowadays the game full of lames and straight gays
Niggas throwing shade and hate from a fake page
Niggas catfishing for asswhippings
Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death blood on this Raf Simons
Fiends like Santana where you at with it
Back like cooked crack yall done gave too many bad fixes
Looking at my Rollie its bout that time yo
Extended clip have your whip jumping like pot holes
Yeah Im the main event you the side show
Times up mine go  hit em with the Young MA flow 
I think these niggas think I lost my mojo
No I think its time I let these niggas know so
They cant fuck with me and they know so
Im out here rocking Gucci like its Polo
Stil drippin sauce thats that Mojo
They know I got that spice that Adobo
And Im still selling coke tho
Let me stop you niggas cops Robo
My nigga Black an animal stay on go mode
Bounce keep the tre cinco ocho
Chewie coming home they like oh no
Cause they know how he playing with that 45
Aint talkin weed when I tell my niggas blow smoke
Aint talkin rain when I say youll get your clothes soaked
Watch my name when you rap might get your throat choke
Might tell your bitch to come over get these slow pokes
She gon get each and every one of her holes poked
Lil Yachty in that pussy I got that row boat
Yeah back on the heels again
Born to lose build to win
Yall niggas know now
Nowadays the game full of lames and straight gays
Niggas throwing shade and hate from a fake page
Niggas catfishing for asswhippings
Catch him in traffic while his ass slipping
The MAC hit em let his jacks spin it
Now you fresh to death blood on this Raf Simons
