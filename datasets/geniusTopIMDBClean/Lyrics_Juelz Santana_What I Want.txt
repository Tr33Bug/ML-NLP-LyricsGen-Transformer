I think the feds is buggin my phone
I think the feds is buggin my phone
I dont be talking to niggas that long
I think my girl got a bug on my phone
I dont be talking to bitches that long
Still doing what the fuck I want
Cause where Im from niggas dont live that long
Still doing what the fuck I want
Cause where Im from niggas dont live that long
Im just doing what the fuck I want
Getting money they know what the fuck is up
Foreign car red lining never buckled up
Swag drippin spilling she just wanna suck it up
Keep my gun cause nowadays nigga dont knuckle up
And I treat it like my girl we stay cuddled up
Its different these niggas killin just to say they did it
Im trying to make a 100 million just to say I did it
God willin god willin still fuckin all these niggas bitches
Just to say I did it
But they acting like they fucking gs
You a sucker how the fuck you gonna be sucker free
Where Im from niggas dont live that long
They live longer on the shirts that we put em on
Rip to all my niggas gone soon as you start ballin
They wanna pick you off
Feds too thats why I give and go pick and roll
They hate to see a young nigga get it all
Fuck them haters got some down bitches I could call
I think my phone bugged so we dont talk much
The game is never fair but nowadays it aint even even
These niggas snitch before they get to the precinct
I think my phone tapped for some reason they think I know where the coke at
Might catch me ordering pounds just cause I smoke that
Lifes a pretty bitch with a big butt
I just be hitting it fuck a gym I got a real nigga membership
That pistol and that work is the only thing I lift
Money coming money going bad bitches blowing
My teacher told me youll be dead before you know it
Nah bitch Im always strapped fully loaded
So you better warm out only time on it
Everybody wanna be a boss but it cost
And thats the price they cant afford
And if I die know Im gonn be well
Cause Im too fly and Im too high to go to hell
