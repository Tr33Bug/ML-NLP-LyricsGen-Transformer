Uhhuh Santana
I like that man that baddababa thats hot
I like that yeah who are you Santana
Shit is crazy man
Yall think niggas dont cry We do
Yeah man I gotta get my thoughts together I be thinking a lot
Light up a blunt think of a rhyme sometimes too
But its like yo zone out yo
The time is now my grind is here shit
My body is focused my minds in gear lets start it
Im moving at an unstoppable pace
I managed to reach the top of the race
Before it started damn coldhearted man
Rip apart your man for that green dollar
Plain reppin my target stay and holla
Shoot and move from where ever my targets land
Damn shit I see ghosts when I sleep
Its really I got to wake up just to know I was sleep
Holding the heat cold sweat all over my sheet
Thats why I paint the most vividest pictures
For my niggas my bitches in the same position I live in
No oil and hot water just boiling hot water
Cooking coke to the oil and hot water shit
But who am I man
Who am I Who am I
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I Who am I
That think a man should never never never cry
Yo I lived the life of a loner with a righteous persona
But still sold crack right on the corner
My life consist of a big puzzle thats mixed up
Big bucks big drugs if I get caught then its big cuffs
Big bailor gets up I get out shit what this shit sucks
I need to find another road to follow
One thats new and strong not old and hollow oh
As I hold this bottle and smoke this reefer
Listening to some old Aaliyah I say damn
Damn man shit is crazy man woooh 
And a tear comes trimbling down
Never seen a man cry well you witness it now
Shit this isnt game from the heart this pain from the heart
This for you Dame it came from the heart so
Who am I Who am I
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I Who am I
That think a man should never never never cry
Momma I just want you to know
Im in love with you so
If you wasnt here Id be in love with you soul
My angel mommy Id die faithful
Just knowing somone tried to violate you
Ill slide 8ths through the side of their facial
Squeeze and rip apart a side of their facial
Id take a slug eat a bullet Id swallow the gun
Shit you gotta know Im your son
Damn this type of love could only come from a son
Hold up mommy Im twisted Im drunklisten
Cmon man listen to me damn
Damn  Im talking to you
Once again man once again I love you
Yeah but its more than the liquor and weed
Yeah its more than the liquor in me
Shit I gotta get it together
I was falling off with drunk words and sober thoughts
So Im still speaking the truth
And what Im still speaking is truth
This is your youngest son speaking to you mommy
Who am I Who am I
That think a man should never never never cry
Who am I Who am I
That think a man should never never never cry
