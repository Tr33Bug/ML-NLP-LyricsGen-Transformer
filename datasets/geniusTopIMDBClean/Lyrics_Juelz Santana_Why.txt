Damn shit  why 
Its like the beat is just asking me why  why 
Why Im rapping to yall
Listen  come on 
My name mean a lot to me pain mean a lot to me
Fame means nothing but the game means a lot to me
I slang caine on these blocks for weeks
Ever since Rocky III and the death of Apollo Creed
I was a tiny little poppy seed
As grimy as I could be as shiesty as I could be
Niggas who live nicely who dont understand the life of me
Other niggas dont like me and wanna take my life from me
They dont understand that I love it and I like the beef
The raw the guns the violence its all right with me
I be laying in the cut where the sniper be
Righteously waiting for you to get out the drivers seat
Damn  damn its crazy man I dont think like usual people
Who think like usual people who dont think right
I think like Muslims in movements of people who move they people and move on your people
Power is stronger than voo doo and evil
Im immune I drunk the juice took a root from the needle
Still trying to figure out why I do the crimes I do
With the minds IQ of an Einstein too
Tell em Chacha and bafangoo
They think Im crazy well I do too
Leave me alone please Im in my twothree zone please
Nothing can stop me you fuckers cant stop me its crazy
Why why why whyyyy
Why why why whyyyy
Its like my life keeps turning around
Every second I need a lighter I keep burning it down
I smoke so much I could nurture a pound
My thoughts is always foggy they blurring right now
Listen  listen  I told you  told you man 
I see the game for what its worth pain fame and work
Girls walk with they brain in their skirt
So while you fucking they thinking
Of ways to get even or a way out the hood they make up a reason
For the judge for you take him and see him
Until you face a subpoena thatll change your demeanor
So be careful where you skating through this game
Remember its other niggas playing skating in your lane
Dont get clipped or slip skating in the rain
Cause niggas will keep rolling and skating on your brain
Thats just the rules and regulations of the game
When you playing you you playing
And you paying like you weigh in so told you again  listen 
If not those wolves aiming where you laying
And waiting on you patient with that thing up in the basement
Thats why I walk with that thing out when Im pasting
Cause I know these niggas hate it that their little sisters love it
And their girls really want it plus Im fronting
Twenty three big trucking new Z new bucket
Fuck it  fuck it I dont know why listen 
Stop asking stop asking 
Why why why whyyyy
Why why why whyyyy
Why why why whyyyy
Why why why
