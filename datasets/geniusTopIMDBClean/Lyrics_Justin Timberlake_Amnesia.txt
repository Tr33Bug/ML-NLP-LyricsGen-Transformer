Keeps coming closer
I dont but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type
Amnesia thats over
I can see your breathing girl is colder
I can see you need me but I dont care
My whole memory of me and love
Gone so far from me girl
Its not fair
I could feel it almost start to change  Almost start to change 
But then it hurts too much
Thats when it starts to fade
So cold baby now Im going crazy
I dont know why youd leave me alone
If it was true if it was you
Dont you think
Dont you think I would know
Amnesia every memory fades away til its gone
Where did you go
Amnesia went from everything to nothing
No we anymore shes a stranger that I used to know
Now these photos of us
So happy so in love
Tell me what happened
Who are they Where did they go
And when was enough enough
When did all the fire turn colder
When did your heart start to beat slower
My whole memory of me in loves gone so far from me Its not fair
And I can feel it almost start to change  Almost start to change 
But it just hurts too much I let it go away
So cold baby now Im going crazy
I dont know why youd leave me alone
If it was true if it was you
Dont you think
Dont you think I would know
Amnesia every memory fades away til its gone
Where did you go
Amnesia went from everything to nothing
No we anymore shes a stranger that I used to know
I can feel it almost start to change  Almost start to change 
But then it hurts too much I let it go away uuuh
So cold baby  So cold  now Im going crazy
I dont know why youd leave me alone
If it was true if it was you
Dont you think
Dont you think I would know
Amnesia every memory fades away til its gone
Where did you go
Amnesia everything to nothing
No we anymore shes a stranger
Amnesia every memory fades away til its gone
Where did you go
Amnesia everything to nothing
No we anymore shes a stranger that I used to know
And I dont know you anymore
Everything to nothing
Everything to nothing
Shes a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia amnesia amnesia
