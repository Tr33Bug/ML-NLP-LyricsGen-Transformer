Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and Ill always find you
If my red eyes dont see you anymore
And I cant hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat Ill go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below
And under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and Ill always find you
If my red eyes dont see you anymore
And I cant hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat Ill go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
20000 leagues away catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace Ill let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here fade out and disappear
If my red eyes dont see you anymore
And I cant hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat Ill go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
