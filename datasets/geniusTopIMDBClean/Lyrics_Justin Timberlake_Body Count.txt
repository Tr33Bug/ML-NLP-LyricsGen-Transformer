Body Count Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Timbo
Yeah, Rob, Rob, J, ha, yeah, yeah
It's what we do
Know y'all been waiting but

Hey, girl (Hey girl)
I bet you I talk you right out out out them them them them drawers
I bet you I talk you right out them drawers
I bet you I take you right out them drawers, ha ha
Hey, JT, sing that shit, as I pause
I was a boxer 'til I knocked that out
I played a doctor 'til I made that house call
I had a shy little quiet girl but now she sings opera loud
But my train is on your track now
So watch out

With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I’m gettin’ my way like a kid in a candy store
I think you got what I want
And by the end of the night, when you hot like a light
It'll be 'cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you're on what I'm on, then you already know, c'mon

Help me, I’m going down
That’s what I hear her say
Baby, my body count
Is blowing up all the way, hey
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count

Hey, girl (Hey girl)
I bet you I talk you right out them drawers
I bet you I talk you right out them drawers
I bet you I take you right out them drawers
Hey, JT, sing that shit, as I pause
You might also like
That’s what I’m talkin’ 'bout
Waitress 'til she got that tip
Sailor 'til I sunk that ship
Yeah, I had a hot little fire girl
But now she just smoke, that’s it
And I ain’t gon' stop 'til I get you out on top of this list

With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I’m gettin’ my way like a kid in a candy store
I think you got what I want
And by the end of the night, when you hot like a light
It'll be 'cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you're on what I'm on, then you already know, c'mon

Help me, I’m going down
That’s what I hear her say
Baby, my body count
Is blowing up all the way, hey
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count

Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count

(Ooh) Sign up, put your name down
I'll make your body count until you say (Hey), c'mon
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count (Make my body count)
Make my body count (Make my body count)
Make my body count

Help me, I’m going down
That’s what I hear her say
Baby, my body count
Is blowing up all the way, hey
Help me, I’m going down
That’s what I hear her say
Baby, my body count
Is blowing up all the way, hey
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count
