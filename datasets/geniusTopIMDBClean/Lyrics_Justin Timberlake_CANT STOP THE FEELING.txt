I got this feelin inside my bones
It goes electric wavey when I turn it on
All through my city all through my home
Were flyin up no ceilin when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  Ooh 
I cant take my eyes up off it movin so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it so dont stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when Im gettin you close
When we move well you already know
So just imagine  Just imagine just imagine 
Nothin I can see but you
When you dance dance dance
A feelin good good creepin up on you
So just dance dance dance come on
All those things I shouldnt do
But you dance dance dance
And aint nobody leavin soon so keep dancin
I cant stop the feelin
So just dance dance dance
I cant stop the feelin
So just dance dance dance come on
Ooh its somethin magical
Its in the air its in my blood its rushin on  Rushin on 
I dont need no reason dont need control  Need control 
I fly so high no ceilin when Im in my zone


Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  Ooh 
I cant take my eyes up off it movin so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it so dont stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when Im gettin you close
When we move well you already know
So just imagine  Just imagine just imagine 
Nothin I can see but you
