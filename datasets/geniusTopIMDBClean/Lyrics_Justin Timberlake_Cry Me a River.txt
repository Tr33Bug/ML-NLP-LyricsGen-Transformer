Cry Me a River Lyrics
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say
What you did
I already know
I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

You know that they say that some things are better left unsaid
And it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty, then you may not have blown it, yeah

You don't have to say (Don't have to say)
What you did (What you did)
I already know (I already know)
I found out from him (Uh)
Now there's just no chance (No chance)
With you and me (You and me)
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You might also like
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone? (All alone)
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone (When you call me on the phone)
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy (Not like them, baby)
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn (It's your turn) to cry (So)
Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

Oh (Oh, well)
The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leavin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh (Oh, well)
The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leavin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh (Oh, well)
The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leavin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh (Oh, well)
The damage is done, so I guess I'll be l-l-l-l-leavin' (Oh, oh, oh)

You don't have to say (Don't have to say)
What you did (What you did)
I already know (I already know)
I found out from him (Uh)
Now there's just no chance (No chance)
With you and me (You and me)
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (You can go on and just)
Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)
Cry me a river (Baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Come on, baby, cry)
Cry me a river (Don't wanna cry no more, yeah, yeah)

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)57Embed
