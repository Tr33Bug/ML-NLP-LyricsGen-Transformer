Dress On Lyrics
There’s something 'bout your body
I’m not in a rush
But girl, I’m ready to marry you
Yeah, right here in this restaurant
And start on our honeymoon
Why you still got your dress on?
Why you still got your dress on?

Now, I ain’t trying to offend nobody
But girl, don't they see you?
It’s cool if they don’t
'Cause, hey, I only see me and you
That’s why I’m all over you
Why you still got your dress on?
Why you still got your dress on?
I can’t wait
'Cause girl, as soon as I look in your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me, that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can’t wait

The way I know your body
I don’t really need much
Girl, I know where to touch
Just stay where you are
Drop all your worries
And you can leave all the rest on
We can do it
Why you still got your dress on?

Now, I ain’t trying to offend nobody
But girl, don't they see you?
It’s cool if they don’t
'Cause, hey, I only see me and you
That’s why I’m all over you
Why you still got your dress on?
Why you still got your dress on?
You might also like
Now, I can’t wait
'Cause girl, as soon as I look in your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
And to me, that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can’t wait

Let me take you
So walk with me
Through the beautiful sand as we take pictures
Hips so wide, looks like it’s got whiskers
Let me put a solid gold on that solid figure
Go 'head, show your pretty dentures
Your pretty physique, your pretty toes
I’m pretty with you
I do a good job for that pretty picture
You the prettiest but I’m the only thing that’s missing

I can’t wait
'Cause girl, as soon as I look in your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
And to me, that means that the whole world could change but not mine, yeah
I can’t wait
Now, I can’t wait
'Cause girl, as soon as I look in your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
And to me, that means that the whole world could change but not mine5Embed
