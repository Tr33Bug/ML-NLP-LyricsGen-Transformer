Bittersweet thing could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake
Feel it in my brain tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that weve made
I feel it in the morning youre still here in the morning
I see you but youre gone telephone the doctor Im not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof dont change the truth I dive in but I cant
I cant drink you away
Ive tried Jack Ive tried Jim Ive tried all of their friends
But I cant drink you away
All these rocks I cant swim outta this skin Im livin in
Say now tell me baby dont they make a medicine for heartbreak
Tell me baby now dont they make a medicine for heartbreak
Got that poundin on my brain so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow you can find me doin the same
Cause I just cant forget the way we turned out this bad
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead
And then I feel it in the morning youre still here in the morning
I see you but youre gone telephone the doctor Im not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof dont change the truth I dive in but I cant
I cant drink you away
Ive tried Jack Ive tried Jim Ive tried all of their friends
But I cant drink you away
All these rocks I cant swim outta this skin Im livin in
Say now tell me baby dont they make a medicine for heartbreak
Tell me baby now dont they make a medicine for heartbreak
Break it down
I cant drink you
No I cant drink you away away
I cant drink you
I cant drink you away away
I cant drink you
I cant drink you away away
I cant drink you
No I cant drink you away
I cant drink you away
Ive tried Jack Ive tried Jim Ive tried all of their friends
But I cant drink you away
All these rocks I cant swim outta this skin Im livin in
Say so tell me baby dont they make a medicine for heartbreak
Tell me baby oh yeah now dont they make a medicine for heartbreak
Oh yeah tell me baby cant they make a medicine for my heartbreak heartbreak
Tell me baby now dont they make a medicine for my heartbreak
Cause I cant drink you away
Ive tried Jack Ive tried Jim Ive tried all of my friends
I cant drink you away
All these rocks I cant swim outta this skin Im livin in
