Gimme What I Dont Know  I Want  Lyrics
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle
Why you standing so far away Minding manners and looking on by
Why dont you come out to play
And get closer to your animal inside
Baby I act like the gentleman that your mama would love  Ooh get to know me 
Baby you act like a lady dont have to cover it up  Things you wanna show me 
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love  Teach me slowly 
I think youre ready to try walk a little closer and
Now take me to your jungle Im not afraid
And if youre looking for your animal hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide dont taunt
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Show me your teeth and spread your wings
Down and dirty youre loving me so loud
Rare breed but youre out as a stray ay sideshow in front of the whole crowd
Baby I act like the gentleman that your mama would love  Ooh get to know me 
Baby you act like a lady dont have to cover it up things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love  Teach me slowly 
I think youre ready to try walk a little closer and
Now take me to your jungle Im not afraid
And if youre looking for your animal hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide dont taunt
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle
Deep in the jungle where the creatures meet
The animals come out when they make the sounds of the beat
They pull out they skin so you can really see
That youre dealing with a whole new breed
Now take me to your jungle Im not afraid
And if youre looking for your animal hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide dont taunt
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know dont know I want
Come in come in gimme what I dont know I want
