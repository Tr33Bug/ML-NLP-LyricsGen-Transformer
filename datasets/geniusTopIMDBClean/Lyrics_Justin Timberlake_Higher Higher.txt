Uh stress is cruel fames a lie
But youre special on every level
Success is cool money is fine
But youre special another level
Listen
I see the man they wanna touch ya
Thats when I tell em Uhuh
I guess I am a jealous lover
Cause I aint sharin with another
Uh stress is cruel fames a lie
But youre special on every level
Success is cool and money is fine
But youre special another level
I guess you can say I was lovestruck
I met you you was with your brother
I had to go and get my cousin
Tell a joke and then say Whats up
We both danced to Lucky Star
Eyeing each other then were laughin
I might as well have been some butter
Melting all over girl what
Ooh but you are that thunder lightnin
I need it to get out the darkness
My body told me I was done but
I think it meant to say in trouble
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
To them we might look strange
Its somethin you cant explain
And were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing more to gain
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing more to gain
Gettin higher higher higher
Stress is cruel  Stress is cruel 
Fames a lie  Fames a lie 
But youre special  But youre special 
On every level  On every level 
Success is cool  Success is cool 
And money is fine  Money is fine 
But youre special  But youre special 
Another level  Another level 
Sugar
If its for you it cant be any old thing
Ayy sugar
If its for you it cant be any old thing
Hey
If its for you it cant be any old thing
It cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
I said come on
If its for you it cant be any old thing
I said sugar come on
If its for you it cant be any old thing
If its for you it cant be any old thing
You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
To them we might look strange
Its somethin you cant explain
And were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Were climbing once again
Gettin higher higher higher
Higher higher higher
