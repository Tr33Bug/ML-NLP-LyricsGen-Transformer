Keep lookin at me
Gettin scared now right
Dont fail me baby
Its just Justin
You feel good right
Listen
I kinda noticed somethin wasnt right
From your colorful face
Its kinda weird to me since youre so fine
If its up to me your face will change
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me
Cant nobody love you like I love you
Youre a good girl and thats what makes me trust ya  Hey 
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
See people are so phony
Nosy cause theyre lonely
Arent you sick of the same thing  Thing thing 
They say so and so was datin
Love you or theyre hatin
When it doesnt matter anyway
Cause were here tonight
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Baby just remember
Sing a song with me


Cant nobody love you like I love you
Youre a good girl and thats what makes me trust ya  Hey 
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
