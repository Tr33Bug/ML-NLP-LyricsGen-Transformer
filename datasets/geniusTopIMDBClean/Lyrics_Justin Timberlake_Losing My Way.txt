Yeah uhm
Yeah uh excuse me
Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make fortysome dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped outta school
Having fun I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See I cant put down the pipe
And it is breaking me down watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down is anybody out there
It is breaking me down no more friends around
And my dreams fall down is anybody out there
Can anybody out there hear me
Cause I cant seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me
Cause I cant seem to see myself
Theres gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell
Can anybody out there feel me
Cause I cant seem to feel myself
Losing my way  Oh 
Keep losing my way  Oh 
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way
Losing my way  Oh 
Keep losing my way  Oh 
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way
Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I woulda done anything for my own
But I couldnt get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is Ill probably never know
The color of my daughters eyes


And it is breaking me down watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down is anybody out there
It is breaking me down no more friends around
And my dreams fall down is anybody out there
Can anybody out there hear me
Cause I cant seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me
Cause I cant seem to see myself
Theres gotta be a Heaven somewhere

Can you save me from this hell  Can you save me 
Can anybody out there feel me
