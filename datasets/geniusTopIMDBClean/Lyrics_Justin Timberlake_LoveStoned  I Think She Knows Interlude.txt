LoveStoned  I Think She Knows  Interlude  Lyrics
Hey Uh
Shes freaky and she knows it
Shes freaky and I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except shes got a little more ass
Dont even bother
Unless youve got that thing she likes
Ooh I hope shes goin home with me tonight
Hey
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
Shes got me love stoned man I swear
Shes bad and she knows I think that she knows uh
Shes freaky and she knows it
Shes freaky but I like it
Yeah
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
Shes flawless like some uncut ice
Well I hope shes goin home with me tonight oh
And all she wants is to dance
Thats why youll find her on the floor
But you dont have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
Thats why shes goin home with me tonight oh
Hey
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
Shes got me love stoned man I swear
Shes bad and she knows I think that she knows uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  Cause a glare 
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare  I had to stop and stare 
Shes got me love stoned from everywhere
Shes bad and she knows I think that she knows
Now dance
Get it girl
Youre freaky but I like it
Hot damn
Let me put my funk on this song one time
Ow
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
Shes got me love stoned man I swear
Shes bad and she knows I think that she knows uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
Shes got me love stoned from everywhere
Shes bad and she knows I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
