Yall cant do better than this
Yall cant do better than this

Act like the south aint the shit
Act like the south aint the shit
Act like the south aint the shit
Yall cant do better than this
Yall cant do better than this
Act like the south aint the shit wait
Its just a midnight summers jam
The airs so thin but we dont give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend its our last chance to dance
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
Its in the air hospitality
Anything you want whats mine is yours
But dont you worry about the way I talk woo
Its where Im from come and get you some uh
Hey all of the locals are happy to get out and meet a new face
We dance in circles on and on dosido and then we sway
Even the old folksll come out and rock
And we just hopin the music dont stop til the next day
Its just a midnight summers jam
The airs so thin but we dont give a damn
The starry sky across the land
Where we pretend its our last chance to dance
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
It starts at midnight midnight midnight
Yall cant do better than this
Yall cant do better than this
Yall cant do better than this
Act like the south aint the shit
Act like the south aint the shit
Act like the south aint the shit
Yall cant do better than this
Yall cant do better than this
