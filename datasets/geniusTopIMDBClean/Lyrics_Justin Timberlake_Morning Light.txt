Look every time theres a new sunrise
I open up my eyes
And I say to myself In the whole wide world of guys
I must be the luckiest alive
Cause Im in love with you
Layin here in the mornin light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night
Look I cant even get out of bed
With the thoughts youre puttin in my head
So I say to myself I dont even wanna try
Here every part of me is paralyzed
Cause Im in love with you
Layin here in the mornin light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes Im in love with you
Layin here in the mornin light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night
I know I got somewhere to go
Mmm but Im thinkin we should lay here real low  Lay here real low 
Ooh cause baby its no lie
Ooh I could watch you til the day I die
Cause Im in love with you
Layin here in the mornin light
And all I wanna do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes Im in love with you
Layin here in the mornin light  In the mornin night 
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight just one more one more night
