Walking round middle of the night
Might end a mans life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin everything next
Its murder murder
You say I need to watch out something might go down good
I really wanna take this under the ground under the ground
And Ima be down to go to that level
And even when you speak regular or sick freak girl I say okay
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better
You killin me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
The beds way under the ground under the ground
I will be down and throw it at that level
Ooooh that girl is murder  Everybody get down 
Ooooh that girl is murder  Everybody get down 
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down down
You know that shes a killer
Watch it get down watch it get down
Watch it get down watch it get down
Murder
You dancing round hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all of that below your waist
Girl you know the next scene is murder murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl your bodys gonna end up
Under the ground under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular or freak chic
Girl you complement my taste
So girl dont be stingy the more that you give me the better better
You know you killin me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the beds way under the ground under the ground
I would be down to go to that level


Ooooh that girl is murder  Everybody get down 
Ooooh that girl is murder  Everybody get down 
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down down
You know that shes a killer
Watch it get down watch it get down
