Just to say how much you mean to me  What would you do 
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular  Tell me would you

But I aint seen myself another girl  Like you 
This ring here represents my heart
But theres just one thing I need from you  Saying I do 
Because
I can see us holdin hands
Walkin on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin on the grass layin side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady girl you amaze me
Aint gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love  So dont give away

Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote  What would you do 
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team  Tell me would you 
See whats the point in waitin anymore
Cause girl Ive never been more sure  That baby its you 
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin for  Just say it I do

Walkin on the beach our toes in the sand

Sittin on the grass layin side by side
