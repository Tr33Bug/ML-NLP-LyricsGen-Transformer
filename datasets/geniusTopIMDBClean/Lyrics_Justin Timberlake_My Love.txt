This ring here represents my heart
But theres just one thing I need from you  Saying I do

Walkin on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin on the grass layin side by side
You can be my baby

And made you smile at every word I wrote  What would you do 
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team  Tell me would you

Cause girl Ive never been more sure  That baby its you 
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin for  Just say it I do

Walkin on the beach our toes in the sand
