Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow maybe youll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday
And while were at it throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now youre bleedin
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I wont stop until you believe it
Cause baby youre worth it
So dont act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So dont act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me me
Its not a bad thing to fall in love with me me
Fall yeah
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every mornin I just wanna see you starin back at me  Staring back at me 
Cause I know thats a good place to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now youre bleedin
Dont you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I wont stop until you believe it
Cause baby youre worth it
So dont act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So dont act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me me
Its not a bad thing to fall in love with me me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love 


No I wont fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall youll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine
Dont act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So dont act like its a bad thing to fall in love with me me
Its not a bad thing to fall in love with me me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
