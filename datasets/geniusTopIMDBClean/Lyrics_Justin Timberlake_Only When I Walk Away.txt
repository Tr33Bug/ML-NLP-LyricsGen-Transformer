Girl this little game you play
You dont stop til you go too far
So whats a man like me to say
With a bullet laying in my heart
Damn love we go from so hot to so cold
What am I gonna do about this damn love
Is this shit in sync or insane love
I guess thats the way we play it
She loves me now she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
Whats that baby what you say
Cause you dont want to light up this torch
Cause Ill burn it down all the way
Burn it down til there aint no more
Damn love how did this sound get so amped up
Turn off and silence this damn love
Is this shit in sync or insane love
I guess thats the way we play it
She loves me now she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away
She loves me now she loves me not
She loves me now but only when I walk away

With a bullet laying in your heart
