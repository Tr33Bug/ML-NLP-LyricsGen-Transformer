Dont be so quick to walk away

Just let me rock you til the break of day
Dance with me
Guy time but I dont mind
Just wanna rock you girl
Ill have whatever you have
Come on lets give it a whirl
See Ive been watchin you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead girl just do
That assshakin thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor

Pull you close and share my groove


So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
