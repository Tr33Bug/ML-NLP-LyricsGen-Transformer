Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day
Dance with me

Guy time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, let's give it a whirl
See, I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass-shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day
Dance with me

I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you, girl
Make a move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See, it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gon' do
Pull you close and share my groove
You might also like
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day
Dance with me

Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long
Talk to me, boy
Better have you naked by the end of this song
So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
Came to romance with you
You're searchin' for love forever more
And I'll take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl

Hey, dance with me
Yeah
Come on, baby

Don't be so quick to walk away (Don't walk away)
Come on and dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay (Let me rock your body)
Come on and dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play (You don't have to admit you wanna play)
Just dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day (Do-do-do-do)
Come on and dance with me

Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long (Come on, baby)
Talk to me, boy
Better have you naked by the end of this song

Don't be so quick to walk away (I was just thinkin' of you)
Don't be so quick to walk away (We could do somethin')
Don't be so quick to walk away (I like the way you look right now)
Don't be so quick to walk away (Come over here, baby)

Are you feelin' me?
Let's do somethin'
Let's make a bet
'Cause I
I better have you naked by the end of this song21Embed
