Mhmm yeah alright
Ooh
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still I dont go there
Everybody says Say something
Then Say something say something
Then Say something say something
Then Say something
I dont want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere
Theres melody and harmony for you and me tonight
Ooh whoa  I hear them call my name
Everybody says Say something
Then Say something say something
Then Say something say something
Then Say something
I dont want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing
But I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I cant help myself no I cant help myself no no no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have
Maybe Im looking for something I cant have 
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something
Is to say nothing
