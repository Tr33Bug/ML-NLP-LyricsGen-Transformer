Do you remember
The 21st night of September
Love was changin the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin
In the key that our souls were singin
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya  say do you remember
Ba de ya  dancin in September
Ba de ya  never was a cloudy day
Ba duda ba duda ba duda badu
Ba duda badu ba duda badu
Ba duda badu ba duda
My thoughts are with you
Holdin hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the true love we share today
Ba de ya  say do you remember
Ba de ya  dancin in September
Ba de ya  never was a cloudy day
And we say
Ba de ya  say do you remember
Ba de ya  dancin in September
Ba de ya  never was a cloudy day
The bell was ringin aha
Our souls were singin
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya  say do you remember
Ba de ya  dancin in September
Ba de ya  never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya  say do you remember
Ba de ya  dancin in September
