Seorita Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
Its my pleasure to introduce to you
Hes a friend of mine  Yes yes I am 
And he goes by the name
Haha Justin  Wowooh 
All the way from Memphis Tennessee
And he got somethin special for yall tonight
He gon sing a song for yall about this girl
Come in right here 
Yeah come on
On that sunny day didnt know Id meet
Such a beautiful girl walkin down the street  Sing it 
Seen those bright brown eyes with tears coming down  So he said to himself 
She deserves a crown but where is it now
Mama listen
Seorita I feel for you
You deal with things that you dont have to
He doesnt love ya I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my
Runnin fast in my mind girl dont you slow it down
If we carry on this way this thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly Thats how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown oh hasnt it been found
Mama listen
Seorita I feel for you  Feel for you 
You deal with things that you dont have to
He doesnt love ya I can tell by his charm  He dont love ya baby 
But you could feel this real love  Feel it

Ah ah arms  Ho   Mama lay in my

And I know if you give us a try  I want you girl 
Ill work harder for you girl  Woah oh 
And no longer will you ever have to cry
Seorita I feel for you  Yeah yeah yeah 
You deal with things  Deal with things  that you dont have to

But you could feel this real love  Feel it
