But I just want to fly  Fly away with you you you you 
I dont want to be the one to alienate yeah  Alienate 
You see Im trying to find an alien in you  You  if its cool  Cool 
We cant take an airplane
Where were going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
Got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat so lets ride
Hop into my spaceship coupe
Theres only room for two  Me and you 
And with the top down
Well cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Would you like that 
Hop into my spaceship coupe
Theres only room for two  Me and you 
And with the top off youre wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  Yeah

But honey I just want to turn out this space with you  You you you 
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play yeah  That milky way 
And sugar Ill take my time
And show you the backseat view  View  if its cool  Cool 
We cant take an airplane
Where were going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
Got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
I saved you a seat so lets ride
Hop into my spaceship coupe
Theres only room for two  And thats me and you 
And with the top down
Well cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe
Theres only room for two  Me and you 
And with the top off youre wrapped up

Where you and me and all of the stars collide tonight

Where we take off
And then we fly far away far away far away
Hop into my spaceship coupe
