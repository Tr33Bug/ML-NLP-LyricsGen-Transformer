Hey pretty lady
This goes out to you  This goes out to you you you 
I know I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day
This goes out to you you you 
This is dedicated to you dedicated to you dedicated to you
Dedicated to you dedicated to you dedicated to you
Pretty lady when you walk by
It was such a mellow mellow mellow day
When you walk by sunshine
It was such a mellow mellow mellow
I I cant deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
Its a mystery I dont know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell its pure just by the taste
And you kiss me
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away far away
Dont worry about your loving it wont go to waste go to waste
Dont ever change your flavor cause I love the taste love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go I say all the way
Cause shes just like nothing
That I ever seen before
And baby please dont change nothing
Because your flavors so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you this goes out to you
So tell me why were making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
Cause you dont wanna work here anyway
And baby I girl Im all addicted and I wont fight
You and me thats the recipe for a good time
And it aint really nothing but clothes in the way
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away far away
Dont worry about your loving it wont go to waste go to waste
Dont ever change your flavor cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go I say all the way
Cause shes just like nothing
That I ever seen before
And baby please dont change nothing
Because your flavors so original
And it all started when she said
