Summer Love  Set the Mood  Prelude  Lyrics
Ridin in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin lanes girl
Pull up to the red light lookin right
Come here let me get your name girl
Tell me where you from what you do what you like
Let me pick your brain girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face
On that pretty little frame girl
But let me show you round let me take you out
Bet you we could have some fun girl
Cause we can do it fast fast slow
Whichever way you wanna run girl
But let me buy you drinks better yet rings
Do it how you want it done girl
And who wouldve thought that you could be the one cause I
I cant wait to fall in love with you
You cant wait to fall in love with me
This just cant be summer love youll see

Come on and lemme show you round let me take you out
Bet you we could have some fun girl
Cause we can dress it up we can dress it down
Any way you want it done girl
Or we can stay home talkin on the phone
Rappin til we see the sun girl

Just gotta show you that Im the one girl
Well Ima freak you right each and every night

Cause I can make it hot make it stop
Make you wanna say my name girl
Come on baby please cause Im on my knees
Cant get you off my brain girl
But who wouldve thought that you could be the one cause I

Cause I cant wait to fall in love with you
