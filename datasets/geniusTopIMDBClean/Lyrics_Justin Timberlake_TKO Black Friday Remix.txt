TKO  Black Friday Remix  Lyrics
I dont understand it
Tell me how could you be so low
And all in thrilling new living sound 
Dammit babe
Dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe 
Blood thicker than water right
Fuck bitches they all alike
Stand up nigga not the fallin type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called Control was on
The room got nearer the tune got clearer
Thats when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl what is that a ringtone
Shit not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what Imma do
Decisions decisions
In case this is war then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems my triggers on auto
Ill make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit you dont believe in me
I dont need you I got me bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree bitch
Two gold plaques I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on JayZ bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me bitch
You try to fuckin play me I ought to knock your ass out
TKO I dont understand it tell me how could you be so low damn take out 
Youve been swingin after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt through my chest perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
Dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe 
All hail Pretty Flacko bitch celebrate it
Had the game on lock streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated thats the devil aint it
Fuck that shit he rich fuck that shit he this fuck that shit he that
He black he dont like blacks fuck that shit he wack
Fuck that shit he raps fuck that shit he spits fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with finished talking shit Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses fuck surprises
Im monogamous and not to mention in my closet
Is a model chick grimey gothic fits trapped inside of it
Besides it Id deny the shit shit yall should stop the shit
Im the shit not just kinda sick the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it clickclick opposite stop and droppin shit
fore poppin shit from popular to poppin picks to poppin tits
She pop her pussy pop a Xanny popular for compliments
Make it rain she pop that shit it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic I hope God forgive you peep my common sense
TKO I dont understand it tell me how could you be so low
Youve been swingin after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt through my chest perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
Dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe dammit babe 
JT this like deja vu right
All this album of the year talk niggas claimin theyre the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cubans poking my chest out
They keep callin on King Push this beach chair Im stretched out
My name is my name bitch until Im gone and its etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine I made her mind she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire even better Im a reallionaire
Alaa skirt Fendi work dress my baby like buildabear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie Fuck you know about blowin bands
Bezel on it like a grand circle diamonds in it holdin hands
A1 since day one I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and its so dope what I made from it
No lie know why Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime
She aint know we aint know try to trap her but she aint slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow its lights out TKO
