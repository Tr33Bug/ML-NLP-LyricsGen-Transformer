There goes the howl
Ah give it to me
There goes the boogie

Red was the color of her eyes
She put me in a meditation state
Her skin is white so white
Looked like it had no expiration date
Black is the color of the night
When its time for feeding and her body wakes
Theres just something bout the demon that she brings out in me
When we raise hell I cant stay away
Aw give it to me now
So evil in the dress 
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh 
Once she starts to evoke the spirit
Got you on the floor 
Ooh she comes alive when you look killing
Hungry for some more 
Hey I think shes got that true blood
Every time youre round I can smell it in you
Shes got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
Its that demon next to me thats got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
Shes got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say
Now I feel my fever on the rise
And the bones in my body start to quake
Straight up from my toes to my mind
She controls me but I dont want to escape
All of you ones that have tried
Find out that they have made the final mistake
But when she got a bite of my type
She told me that she found her perfect bloodmate
Aw give it to me now
So evil in the dress 
It circulates you start to feel it
Devil in the flesh 
Once she starts to evoke the spirit
Got you on the floor 
Ooh she comes alive when you look killing
Hungry for some more 
Hey I think shes got that true blood
Every time youre round I can smell it in you
Shes got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
Its that demon next to me thats got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
Shes got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes me say
It makes me say
Your pheromones invaded my instinct
I stalked your scent like an animal
Roast me in your perfection Im mad
I dont wanna think
Cause the others wanna burn with me
But they dont hold a candle
It feels like
It feels like
The others wanna burn with me
But they dont hold a candle  Candle candle candle 
Now some funky guitar
Give it to me
Break 
Hey I think shes got that true blood
Every time youre round I can smell it in you
Shes got that true blood
I come around and raise the hell out of you
Its that demon next to me thats got me screaming
Make me wanna build a coffin for two
Shes got that true blood
But baby I just do it for the thrill out of you
It makes say
Ah give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah give it to me
There goes the boogie
There goes the howl
Ah give it to me
