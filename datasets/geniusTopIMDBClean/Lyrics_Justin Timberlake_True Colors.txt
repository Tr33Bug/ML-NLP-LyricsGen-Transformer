You with the sad eyes
Dont be discouraged oh I realize
Its hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
The darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
Show me a smile then dont be unhappy
Cant remember when I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy
And youve taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Cause I will always be there
And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and thats why I love you
So dont be afraid to let them show
Your true colors true colors are beautiful
I see your true colors shining through  True colors 
I see your true colors and thats why I love you
So dont be afraid to let them show
Your true colors true colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow ohh ohh ohh like a rainbow
Cant remember when
I last saw you laughing ohohhh
This world makes you crazy
Taking all you can bear
Just call me up
Cause Ill be always be there
And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and thats why I love you
So dont be afraid  Dont be afraid 
To let them show
Your true colors true colors are beautiful
Like a rainbow  Ohhohh 
Like a rainbow oohooh
