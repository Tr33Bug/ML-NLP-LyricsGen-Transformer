Dont know why but girl Im feeling close to you
Maybe its this ocean view Im so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
For too long too long too long
I wrote a song for you I wanna sing to you
But every time Im close to you
The words wanna come out but I forget
Its so strong its so strong its so strong
It might seem like Im catching something
Thats because its true
I cant deny it and I wont try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I cant deny it and I stand by it
And I wont hide it anymore
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears disappears disappears disappears
Yeah a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lenss only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear comes so clear becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you

Now that I know the truth what am I suppose to do
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
Im so gone Im so gone Im so gone
Just like the movie shoot Im zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun
It might seem like Im catching something
Thats because its true
I cant deny it and I wont try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I cant deny it and I stand by it
And I wont hide it anymore
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears disappears disappears disappears
