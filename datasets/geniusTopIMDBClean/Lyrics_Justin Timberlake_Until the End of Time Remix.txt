And heard the TV sayin somethin
About disaster in the world and

Theres so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know that Ill be alright
Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Well that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
Cause Im gonna love you girl until the end of time
