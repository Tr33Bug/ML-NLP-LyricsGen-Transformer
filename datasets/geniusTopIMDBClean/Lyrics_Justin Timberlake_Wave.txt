Lets go to an island
Like we did last year catch a vibe
The dreamiest weather
The bluest water and bonfires
I got on rosecoloured glasses
Battin your eyelashes
Come on dont be passive
Some us time would be magic  Ooh 
This is fantastic and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love
Would you believe were alone
So far from home but you love it though
Set yourself free in a zone
Aint got no phone dont need it though
Cause it aint got no waves  Waves
