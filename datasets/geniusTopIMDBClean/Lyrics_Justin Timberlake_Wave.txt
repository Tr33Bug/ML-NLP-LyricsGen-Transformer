Wave Lyrics
Yeah
This is?
Yeah, come on, go (Hahahaha)
Wave
Wave, wave
Wave

Let's go to an island
Like we did last year, catch a vibe
The dreamiest weather
The bluest water and bonfires
I got on rose-coloured glasses
Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some "us" time would be magic (Ooh)
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone?
So far from home, but you love it, though
Set yourself free in a zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it, though

'Cause it ain't got no waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
And just wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)

Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)
(Uh, hey)
You might also like
Let's do some more riding
I'll catch a couple fish, then we can dine
Look, we're getting better
Aging like your favorite wine, hey

I got on rose-colored glasses
Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some "us" time would be magic (Ooh)
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone?
So far from home, but you love it, though
Set yourself free in a zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it, though

'Cause it ain't got no waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
And just wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave
Wave, wave
Wave
Wave, wave

I swear that you (Yeah, we're goin')
Some "us" time, my favorite pursuit (Yeah, we're goin')
Bring your ring of shades, no need for shoes (Yeah, we're goin')
All I need is your skin and the air
I swear to you (Come on, babe, come on, babe)
Some "us" time, my favorite pursuit (Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Bring your ring of shades, no need for shoes (Come on, babe, come on, babe)
All I need is your skin and the air (Let's go, let's go, let's go)

Let's go, wave
Wave
Wave (Wave)
Wave
Wave
Wave (Wave)
Wave
Wave
Wave, wave
Wave
Wave, wave
Wave, wave

I got on rose-colored glasses
Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some us time would be magic (Ooh!)
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone?
So far from home, but you love it, though
Set yourself free in a zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it, though

'Cause it ain't got no waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
Waves (Waves)
And just wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)
Wave (Wave)

Now the other way
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave, wave)
Now the other way
Now the other way (Wave, wave)
Now the other way
Now the other way (Wave)
Now the other way (Wave)5Embed
