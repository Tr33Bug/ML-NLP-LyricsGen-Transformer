Im sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while
Youll reacquaint yourself with my style
Well how could you have waited so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years
Im sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years
And baby wont you let me
I think Im going out of my head
Im just about to ooh yeah ha
Im sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while would you babe
Youll reacquaint yourself with my style
