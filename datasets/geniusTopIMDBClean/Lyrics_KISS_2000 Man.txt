2,000 Man Lyrics
Well, my name it is a number
It's on a piece of plastic film
And I been growing funny flowers
Outside of my little windowsill

But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

You know, my wife still respects me
Even though I really misuse her
I am having an affair
With a random computer
But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, your brain's still flashing
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashing
Seein' all the things you'd done
Spacing out and having fun

Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun
Oh daddy, proud of your planet
Oh mommy, proud of your sun

Oh daddy, your brain's still flashing
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashing
Seein' all the things you'd done
Spacing out and having fun

But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
Understand me
U-understand me
U-understand me, now understand me
But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
But don't you know I'm a 2,000 man
And my kids, they just don't understand me at all
I'm a 2,000 man
I'm a 2,000 man
I'm a 2,000 man
I'm a 2,000 man, yeah, 2,000Embed
