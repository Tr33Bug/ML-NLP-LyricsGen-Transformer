Well my name it is a number
Its on a piece of plastic film
And I been growing funny flowers
Outside of my little windowsill
But dont you know Im a 2000 man
And my kids they just dont understand me at all
You know my wife still respects me
Even though I really misuse her
I am having an affair
With a random computer
But dont you know Im a 2000 man
And my kids they just dont understand me at all
Oh daddy proud of your planet
Oh mommy proud of your sun
Oh daddy proud of your planet
Oh mommy proud of your sun
Oh daddy your brains still flashing
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashing
Seein all the things youd done
Spacing out and having fun
Oh daddy proud of your planet
Oh mommy proud of your sun
Oh daddy proud of your planet
Oh mommy proud of your sun
Oh daddy your brains still flashing
Like they did when you were young
Or did they come down crashing
Seein all the things youd done
Spacing out and having fun


But dont you know Im a 2000 man
And my kids they just dont understand me at all
But dont you know Im a 2000 man
And my kids they just dont understand me at all
Understand me
Uunderstand me
Uunderstand me now understand me
But dont you know Im a 2000 man
And my kids they just dont understand me at all
But dont you know Im a 2000 man
And my kids they just dont understand me at all
Im a 2000 man
Im a 2000 man
Im a 2000 man
Im a 2000 man yeah 2
