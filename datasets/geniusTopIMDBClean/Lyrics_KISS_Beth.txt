Beth I hear you calling
But I cant come home right now
Me and the boys are playing
And we just cant find the sound
Just a few more hours
And Ill be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
Oh Beth what can I do Beth what can I do
You say you feel so empty
That our house just aint a home
And Im always somewhere else
And youre always there alone
Just a few more hours
And Ill be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
Oh Beth what can I do Beth what can I do
Beth I know youre lonely
And I hope youll be alright
Cause me and the boys will be playing
All night
