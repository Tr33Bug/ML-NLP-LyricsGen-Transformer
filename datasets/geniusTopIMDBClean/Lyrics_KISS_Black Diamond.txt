Out on the street for a living
Pictures only begun  oohoohooh 
Got you under their thumb
Hit it
Out on the streets for a living
Pictures only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb
Whoo black diamond
Whoo black diamond
Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too  oohoohooh 
And though you dont ask for pity
Theres nothing that you can do no no
Whoo black diamond
Whoo black diamond
Out on the streets for a living
Pictures only begun  oohoohooh 
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb
Whoo black diamond yeah
Whoo black diamond
