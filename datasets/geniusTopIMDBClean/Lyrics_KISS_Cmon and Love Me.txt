Shes a dancer a romancer
Im a Capricorn and shes a Cancer
She saw my picture in a music magazine
When she met me said shed get me
Touched her hips and told me that shed let me
I took her hand baby this is what I said
I said Baby baby dont you hesitate
Cause I just cant wait
Lady wont you take me down on my knees
You can do what you please
Cmon and love me
Im a man Im no baby
And youre looking every inch a lady
Youre good looking and youre looking like you should be good
You were distant now youre nearer
I can feel your face inside the mirror
The lights are out and I can feel you baby with my hand
So baby baby dont you hesitate
Cause I just cant wait
Lady wont you take me down to my knees
You can do what you please
Cmon and love me
Cmon and love me
Cmon and love me
Cmon and love me
Baby baby dont you hesitate
Cause I just cant wait
Lady wont you take me down on my knees
You can do what you please
Cmon and love me
Cmon and love me
Cmon and love me
Cmon and love me
Cmon and love me
