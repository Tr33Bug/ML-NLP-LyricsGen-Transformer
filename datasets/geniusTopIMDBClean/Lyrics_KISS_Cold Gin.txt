Whoo
All right
My heaters broke and Im so tired
I need some fuel to build a fire
The girl next door her lights are out yeah ooh
The landlords gone Im down and out
Ooh its cold gin time again
You know itll always win
Cold gin time again
You know its the only thing
That keeps us together ow
Its time to leave and get another quart
Around the corner at the liquor store
Hehheh the cheapest stuff is all I need
To get me back on my feet again
Ooh its cold gin time again
You know itll always win
Its cold gin time again
You know its the only thing
That keeps us together ow
Whoa yeah
Ooh its cold gin time again
You know itll always win
Its cold gin time again
You know its the only thing
That keeps us together ow
