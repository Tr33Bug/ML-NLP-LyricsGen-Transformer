Whoow
Heres a little song for everybody out there
People try to take my soul away
But I dont hear the rap that they all say
They try to tell us we dont belong
Thats alright were millions strong
This is my music it makes me proud
These are my people and this is my crowd
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights
Sometimes days are so hard to survive
A million ways to bury you alive
The sun goes down like a bad bad dream
Youre wound up tight gotta let off steam
They say they can break you again and again
If life is a radio turn up to ten
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights
Yeah woo
And they try to tell us that we dont belong
But thats alright were millions strong
You are my people you are my crowd
This is our music we love it loud
Yeah and nobodys going to change me
Cause thats who I am
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  Oh yeah 
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  Woahoh 
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  Yeahyeah 
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  Hey 
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  Well yeah 
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights  Come on 
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights
These are crazy crazy crazy crazy nights
