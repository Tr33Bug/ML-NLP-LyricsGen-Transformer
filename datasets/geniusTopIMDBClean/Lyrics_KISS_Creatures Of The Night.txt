Searching in the darkness running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow nothing left to say
Victims of the moment future deep in doubt
Living in a whisper until we start to shout
Were creatures of the night were creatures of the night hey
Breathing in the madness spitting out the lies
Searching for an answer keep your alibis
Dont know where were going just know where weve been
Remember when the clock strikes twelve the losers always win
Searching in the darkness running from the day
Hiding from tomorrow nothing left to say
Gathering up our courage ready for the fight
Howling in the shadows until we start to bite
