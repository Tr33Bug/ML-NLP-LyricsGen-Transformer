Congressional reports
President Ford says that hes disappointed
With Congresss performance
In Detroit a Pontiac Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A headon collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the ninemonth deadlock
Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine oclock the radios the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong tells me what I got to do
I got to
Get up
Everybodys gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybodys gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up
Everybodys gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybodys gonna leave their seat
Getting late I just cant wait
Ten oclock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show
Get up
Everybodys gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybodys gonna leave their seat
Moving fast down 95
Hit top speed but Im still moving much too slow
I feel so good Im so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio it goes
Get up
Everybodys gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybodys gonna leave their seat
Twelve oclock I gotta rock
Theres a truck ahead lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God no time to turn
I got to laugh cause I know Im gonna die
Why
Get up
Everybodys gonna move their feet
Get up
Everybodys gonna leave their seat
Get up
