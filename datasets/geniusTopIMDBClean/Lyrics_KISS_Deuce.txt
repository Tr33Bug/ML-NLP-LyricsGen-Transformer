Get up and get your grandma out of here
Pick up old Jim is working hard this year
And baby do the things he says to do
Baby if youre feeling good
And baby if youre feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
Hes worth a deuce
Honey dont push your man behind his years
And baby stop crying all your tears
Baby do the things he says to do
Do it 
Baby if youre feeling good
Yes baby if youre feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
Hes worth a deuce
Baby if youre feeling good
Yes baby if youre feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
Yeah
