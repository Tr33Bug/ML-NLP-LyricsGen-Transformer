Deuce Lyrics
Get up and get your grandma out of here
Pick up, old Jim is working hard this year
And, baby, do the things he says to do

Baby, if you're feeling good
And, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce
Honey, don't push your man behind his years
And, baby, stop crying all your tears
Baby, do the things he says to do
(Do it)

Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce


Baby, if you're feeling good
Yes, baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
