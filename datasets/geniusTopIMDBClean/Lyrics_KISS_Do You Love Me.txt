You really like my limousine
You like the way the wheels roll
You like my seveninch leather heels
And going to all of the shows but
Do you love me

Do you love me
Really love me
You like the credit cards and private planes
Money can really take you far
You like the hotels and fancy clothes
And the sound of electric guitars but
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
I mean like do you really love me
You really like rock and  roll
All of the fame and the masquerade
You like the concerts and studios
And all the money honey that I make but
Do you love me
Do you love me
Do you love me
Really love me
Your backstage pass and black sunglasses
Make you look just like a queen
Even the fans they know your face
From all of the magazines but
Do you love me  Do you love me 
Do you love me  Do you love me 
Do you love me  Do you love me
