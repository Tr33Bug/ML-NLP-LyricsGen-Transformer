Every Time I Look at You Lyrics
Tried to say I'm sorry
I didn't mean to break your heart
And find you waiting up by the light of day
There's a lot I want to tell you
But I don't know where to start
And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away

Ooh, baby I tried to make it
I just got lost along the way
But every time I look at you
No matter what I'm going through, it's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you, seem to come easily
Because you're everything to me
Yeah, yeah

I never really wanted to let you get inside my heart
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending
I thought it wouldn't matter, if it all just came apart
But now I realize I was just pretending

Ooh, baby, I know I hurt you
But you can still believe in me

Because every time I look at you
No matter what I'm going through, it's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you, seem to come easily
Because you're everything to me

It's going to take a little time to show you
Just what you mean to me, oh yeah
It seems the more I get to know you
The more I need to make you see
You're everything I need, yeah
You might also like
Oho, I need you, I need you, I need you, yeah yeah
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, I know I hurt you, oooh
But you can still believe in me

Because every time I look at you
No matter what I'm going through, it's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you, seem to come easily
Because you're everything to me
You're everything to me, you're everything to meEmbed
