Tried to say Im sorry
I didnt mean to break your heart
And find you waiting up by the light of day
Theres a lot I want to tell you
But I dont know where to start
And I dont know what Id do if you walked away
Ooh baby I tried to make it
I just got lost along the way
But every time I look at you
No matter what Im going through its easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you seem to come easily
Because youre everything to me
Yeah yeah
I never really wanted to let you get inside my heart
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending
I thought it wouldnt matter if it all just came apart
But now I realize I was just pretending
Ooh baby I know I hurt you
But you can still believe in me
Because every time I look at you
No matter what Im going through its easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you seem to come easily
Because youre everything to me
Its going to take a little time to show you
Just what you mean to me oh yeah
It seems the more I get to know you
The more I need to make you see
Youre everything I need yeah


Oho I need you I need you I need you yeah yeah
Ooh baby baby baby I know I hurt you oooh
But you can still believe in me
Because every time I look at you
No matter what Im going through its easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you seem to come easily
Because youre everything to me
Youre everything to me youre everything to me
