Whoohoo yeah
Whoohoo yeah
Shell adore you and shell floor you
With her wisdom and her vision
And youll love it and think of it
Till you lose all intuition come on
She can move you and improve you
With her love and her devotion
And shell thrill you and shell chill you
But youre headed for commotion
And youll need her so youll feed her
With your endless dedication
And the quicker you get sicker
She removes your medication
Get the firehouse
Cause she sets my soul afire
Get the firehouse
And the flames keep getting higher
Shes like bad weather but it seems so good
Youd never leave her but you know you should
Shes like bad weather but it seems so good
Youd never leave her but you know you should
Ooh get the firehouse
Cause she sets my soul afire
Get the firehouse


Whoohoo yeah
Get the firehouse
Whoohoo yeah
