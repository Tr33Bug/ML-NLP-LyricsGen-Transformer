I got to tell you what Im feeling inside I could lie to myself but its true
Theres no denying when I look in your eyes girl Im out of my head over you
I lived so long believin all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin me this time
Its forever this time I know and theres no doubt in my mind
Forever until my life is thru girl Ill be loving you forever
I hear the echo of a promise I made
When youre strong you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look at your face
No I dont want to go it alone
I never thought Id lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time
Its forever this time I know and theres no doubt in my mind
Forever until my life is thru girl Ill be loving you forever
Yeah
I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
Because I lived my life believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time
Its forever this time I know and theres no doubt in my mind
Forever until my life is thru girl Ill be loving you forever
Its forever this time I know and theres no doubt in my mind
Forever until my life is thru girl Ill be loving you forever
