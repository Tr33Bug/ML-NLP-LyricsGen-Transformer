Okay Yall can start singing
Alright set
I cant hear you not that damn loud
Youve got something about you
Youve got something I need
Daughter of Aphrodite
Hear my words and take heed
I was born on Olympus
To my father a son
I was raised by the demons
Trained to reign as the one
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell youre under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
Im the lord of the wastelands
A modernday man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel
Before the
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell youre under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
I am the lord of the wastelands
A modernday man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel
Before the


God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell youre under
Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul
