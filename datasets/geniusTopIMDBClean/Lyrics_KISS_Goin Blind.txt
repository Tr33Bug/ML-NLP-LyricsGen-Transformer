And I know how its to be
There is nothing more for you and I
Some are young and some are free
But I think Im goin blind
Cause I think Im goin blind
And I know how its to be yeah
Little lady cant you see
Youre so young and so much different than I
Im ninetythree youre sixteen
Cant you see Im goin blind
Cause I think Im goin blind
And I know how its to be yeah
Cause I think Im goin blind
And I know how its to be yeah
Youre much younger cant you see
There is nothing more for you and I
Im ninetythree youre sixteen
And I think Im goin blind
Yes I think Im goin blind
And I know how its to be yeah
