Youre sitting in your seat
And then you stand and clutch your breast
Our music drives you wild along with the rest
You watch me singing this song
You see what my mouth can do
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to
And you watch me playing guitar
And you feel what my fingers can do
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to
Well listen
Youve got great expectations
Youve got great expectations
Youre dying to be seen
And you wave and call my name
But in the din it seems that Im a million miles away
You watch me beating my drum
And you know what my hands can do
And you wish you were the one I was doing it to
Well listen
Youve got great expectations
Youve got great expectations
Youve got great expectations
Then you feel these eyes from the stage
And you see me staring at you
And you hear between the lines
My voice is calling to you
Well listen
Youve got great expectations
Youve got great expectations
Youve got great expectations  Do you want to play the role 
Youve got great expectations  Youd even sell me your soul 
Youve got great expectations
Youve got great expectations
Youve got great expectations  Do you want to play the role 
Youve got great expectations  Youd even sell me your soul 
Youve got great expectations  As long as you can play the role 
Youve got great expectations
