If never I met you
Id never have seen you cry
If not for our first Hello
Wed never have to say goodbye
If never I held you
My feelings would never show
Its time I start walking
But theres so much youll never know
I keep telling you hard luck woman
You aint a hard luck woman
Rags a sailors only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags I really love ya
I cant forget about ya
Youll be a hard luck woman
Baby til you find your man
Before I go let me kiss you
And wipe the tears from your eyes
I dont wanna hurt you girl
You know I could never lie
I keep telling you hard luck woman
You aint a hard luck woman
Youll be a hard luck woman
Baby til you find your man
Rags a sailors only daughter
A child of the water
Too proud to be a queen
Rags I really love ya
I cant forget about ya
Youll be a hard luck woman
Baby til you find your man
Youll be a hard luck woman
Baby til you find your man
