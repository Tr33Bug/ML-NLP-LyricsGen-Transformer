Uhuhuhuhuhuhuuuuuhhhh
I look at you and my blood boils hot
I feel my temperature rise
I want it all give me what you got
Theres hunger in your eyes
Im getting closer baby hear me breathe  hah hah hah 
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and youll never leave
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me Heavens on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly Heavens on fire
I got a fever raging in my heart
You make me shiver and shake
Baby dont stop
Take it to the top eat it like a piece of cake
Youre coming closer I can hear you breathe  hah hah hah 
You drive me crazy when you start to tease
You could bring the devil to his knees
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me Heavens on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly Heavens on fire

Im getting closer baby hear me breathe  hah hah hah 
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and youll never leave
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me Heavens on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly Heavens on fire
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me Heavens on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly Heavens on fire
Feel my heat taking you higher
Burn with me Heavens on fire
Paint the sky with desire
Angel fly Heavens on fire
