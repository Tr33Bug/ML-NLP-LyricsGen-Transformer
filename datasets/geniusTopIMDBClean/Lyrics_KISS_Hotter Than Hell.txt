Come on
She looked good she looked hotter than hell
All dressed in satins and lace
I looked at her and it was just too clear
I had to get on the case
I said Lady oh lady can I take you home
Theres just so much we could do
Ill take you all around the whole wide world
Before the evening is through
Hot hot hotter than hell
You know shes gonna leave you welldone
Hot hot hotter than hell
Burn you like the midday sun ow
I asked her why she couldnt make up her mind
She said You dont understand
Id love to go but theres something you should know
She showed me her wedding band
Hot hot hotter than hell
You know shes gonna leave you welldone
Hot hot hotter than hell
Shell burn you like the midday sun yeah
Hot hot hotter than hell
You know shes gonna leave you welldone
Hot hot hotter than hell
Shell burn you like the midday sun ow
