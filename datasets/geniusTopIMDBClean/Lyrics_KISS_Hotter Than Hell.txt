Hotter Than Hell Lyrics
Come on

She looked good, she looked hotter than hell
All dressed in satins and lace
I looked at her and it was just too clear
I had to get on the case

I said, "Lady, oh lady, can I take you home?
There's just so much we could do
I'll take you all around the whole wide world
Before the evening is through"
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
You know she's gonna leave you well-done
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
Burn you like the midday sun, ow

I asked her why she couldn't make up her mind
She said, "You don't understand
I'd love to go, but there's something you should know"
She showed me her wedding band

Hot, hot, hotter than hell
You know she's gonna leave you well-done
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
She'll burn you like the midday sun, yeah

Hot, hot, hotter than hell
You know she's gonna leave you well-done
Hot, hot, hotter than hell
She'll burn you like the midday sun, owYou might also likeEmbed
