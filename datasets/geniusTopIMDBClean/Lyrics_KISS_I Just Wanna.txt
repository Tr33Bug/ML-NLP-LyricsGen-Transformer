I Just Wanna Lyrics
I got a body built for sin and an appetite for passion
Yeah, I can see the road to ruin
And I'm looking for some action
I got my finger on the trigger and a match to the fuse
I'll make someone an offer that's too big to refuse
Tired of trying to be what I'll never be
Baby, you could never see that

I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances, find somebody new
I just want to for, I just want to for
I just want to forget you
I'm going to set the night on fire
Shooting like a Roman Candle
Ooh yeah, I'm burning with desire
And I'm much too hot to handle
I'm like a runaway, crazy train, I'm out of control
If you try to put the brakes on, I'm still going to roll
Tired of trying to do what you want me to
Baby, I'm just tired of you, yeah

I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances, find somebody new
I just want to for, I just want to for, I just want to for
I just want to forget you
Hey!


Wake up, baby, don't you sleep
I can't take this one more week
If I can't go out to play, I can't make it one more day
I want to play with dynamite
Time is right for heavy breathing (Hey!)
Getting stone cold crazy until the dawn without a reason
I want to take me a vacation down a long stretch of track
I'll find a new sensation, and I ain't coming back
Tired of trying to be what I'll never be
Baby, you could never see that
You might also likeI don't want a romance, I don't want to dance
I don't want a romance, or a second chance
I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance
I just want to for, I just want to forget

I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances, find somebody new
I just want to for, I just want to for
I just want to forget
I don't want a romance, I don't want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances, find somebody new
I just want to for, I just want to for
I just want to forget you

I just want to forget you, yeahEmbed
