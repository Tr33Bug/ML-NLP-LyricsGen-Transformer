I got a body built for sin and an appetite for passion
Yeah I can see the road to ruin
And Im looking for some action
I got my finger on the trigger and a match to the fuse
Ill make someone an offer thats too big to refuse
Tired of trying to be what Ill never be
Baby you could never see that
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances find somebody new
I just want to for I just want to for
I just want to forget you
Im going to set the night on fire
Shooting like a Roman Candle
Ooh yeah Im burning with desire
And Im much too hot to handle
Im like a runaway crazy train Im out of control
If you try to put the brakes on Im still going to roll
Tired of trying to do what you want me to
Baby Im just tired of you yeah
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances find somebody new
I just want to for I just want to for I just want to for
I just want to forget you
Hey
Wake up baby dont you sleep
I cant take this one more week
If I cant go out to play I cant make it one more day
I want to play with dynamite
Time is right for heavy breathing  Hey 
Getting stone cold crazy until the dawn without a reason
I want to take me a vacation down a long stretch of track
Ill find a new sensation and I aint coming back
Tired of trying to be what Ill never be
Baby you could never see that
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance
I dont want a romance or a second chance
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance
I just want to for I just want to forget
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances find somebody new
I just want to for I just want to for
I just want to forget
I dont want a romance I dont want to dance
I just want to forget you
Time to take my chances find somebody new
I just want to for I just want to for
I just want to forget you
I just want to forget you yeah
