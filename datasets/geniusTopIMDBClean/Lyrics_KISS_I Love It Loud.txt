Stand up you dont have to be afraid
Get down love is like a hurricane
Street boy no I never could be tamed better believe it
Guilty until Im proven innocent
Whiplash heavy metal accident
Rock on I want to be the president
Cause I love it 
Loud I wanna hear it loud right between the eyes
Loud I wanna hear it loud dont want no compromise
Turn it up hungry for the medicine
Two fisted to the very end
No more treated like aliens were not going to take it
No lies no more alibis
Turn it up got me hypnotized
Rock on wont be tranquilized
Cause I love it 
Loud I wanna hear it loud right between the eyes
Loud I wanna hear it loud dont want no compromise
I love it 
Loud I wanna hear it loud right between the eyes
Loud I wanna hear it loud dont want no compromise

Headlines jungle is the only rule

Loud I wanna hear it loud right between the eyes
