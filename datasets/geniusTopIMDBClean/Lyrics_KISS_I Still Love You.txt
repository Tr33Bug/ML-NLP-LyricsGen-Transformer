You tell me that youre leaving
And Im trying to understand
I had myself believing
I should take it like a man
But if youve got to go then youve got to know
That its killing me
And all the things I never seem to show
Ive got to make you see
Girl its been so long
Tell me  Tell me how could it be
One of us knows the two of us dont belong
In each others company
It hurts so much inside youre telling me goodbye
You want to be free
And knowing that youre gone and leaving me behind
I gotta make you see
I gotta make you see
I gotta make you see
I still love you
I still love you
I really I really love you
I still love you
People tell me
I should win at any cost
But now I see as the smoke clears away
The battle has been lost
I see it in your eyes you never have to lie
Im out of your life
Tonight Ill dream away and you can still be mine
But Im dreaming a lie
Dreaming a lie
Makes me want to die


Cause I still love you
I still love you
Baby baby I love you
I still love you
And when I think of all the things youll never know
Theres so much left to say
Cause girl now I see the price of losing you
Will be my hell to pay
My hell to pay
Each and every day
Hear what I say
I still love you
I still love you
I really I really love you
I still love you
Baby baby I love you
I love you
I really I really love you
