I Stole Your Love Lyrics
Alright

I remember the day that we met
I needed someone, you needed someone too, yeah
Spent time taking all you could get
Givin' yourself was one thing you never could do

You played with my heart, played with my head
I got to laugh when I think of the things you said
'Cause I stole your love, stole your love
Ain't never gonna let you go
I (Oh yeah) stole your love (I stole your love)
Stole your love (I stole your love)

You never stop running around
You pick me up, then you would still put me down
You were the girl that nobody could own
Stay for a while, then you would leave me alone

I'm something different, ain't like the rest
How does it feel to find out you're failing your test?

'Cause I stole your love, stole your love
Ain't never gonna let you go
I (I) stole your love (I stole your love)
Stole your love (I stole your love)
Guitar!


(Listen) I stole your love, stole your love
Ain't never going to let you go
I (I) stole your love (I stole your love)
Stole your love (I stole your love)
You might also like
I (stole your love) stole your love (I stole your love)
Stole your love (I stole your love, oh)
I (Oh yeah) stole your love (I stole your love)
Stole your love (I stole your love)

I (Oh yeah) stole your love, (Oh yeah) stole your love (All right)Embed
