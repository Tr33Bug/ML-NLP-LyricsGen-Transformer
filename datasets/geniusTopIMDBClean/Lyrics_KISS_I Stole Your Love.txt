Alright
I remember the day that we met
I needed someone you needed someone too yeah
Spent time taking all you could get
Givin yourself was one thing you never could do
You played with my heart played with my head
I got to laugh when I think of the things you said
Cause I stole your love stole your love
Aint never gonna let you go
I  Oh yeah  stole your love  I stole your love 
Stole your love  I stole your love 
You never stop running around
You pick me up then you would still put me down
You were the girl that nobody could own
Stay for a while then you would leave me alone
Im something different aint like the rest
How does it feel to find out youre failing your test
Cause I stole your love stole your love
Aint never gonna let you go
I  I  stole your love  I stole your love 
Stole your love  I stole your love 
Guitar
Listen  I stole your love stole your love
Aint never going to let you go
I  I  stole your love  I stole your love 
Stole your love  I stole your love 


I  stole your love  stole your love  I stole your love 
Stole your love  I stole your love oh 
I  Oh yeah  stole your love  I stole your love 
Stole your love  I stole your love 
I  Oh yeah  stole your love  Oh yeah  stole your love  All right
