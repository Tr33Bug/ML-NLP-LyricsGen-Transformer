I got a letter just the other day
She sent a picture but she didnt sign her name
She wore high heels and a little black lace
I knew her body but I couldnt see her face
She didnt leave a number not an address or a clue
But something in that photograph reminded me of you
Baby lets put the X in sex
Loves like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby lets put the X in sex
Keep it undercover baby let me be your private eye
I got a call in the middle of the night
Heavy breathin never sounded quite so nice
She said Ooh yeah I wish that I was there
I asked who was calling but she wasnt playing fair
Sometimes you gotta suffer for the pleasure that you seek
Youre beggin for an eyeful but you only get a peek
Baby lets put the X in sex
Loves like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby lets put the X in sex
Keep it undercover baby let me be your private eye
Whoa yeah
Yeah
I heard somebody knockin so I opened up the door
She wore a hat shades and a trench coat
Wasnt wearin that much more
She said she knew my secrets but I didnt have a clue
Then I saw those black lace panties and I knew that it was you
Baby lets put the X in sex
Loves like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby lets put the X in sex
Keep it undercover baby let me be your private eye
Lets put the X in sex
Loves like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby lets put the X in sex
Keep it undercover baby let me be your private eye
Lets put the X in sex
Loves like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby lets put the X in sex
Keep it undercover baby let me be your private eye
Lets put the X in sex
Loves like a muscle and you make me wanna flex
Baby lets put the X in sex
