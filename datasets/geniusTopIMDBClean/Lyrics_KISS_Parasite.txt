Shell always be there trying to grab a hold
She thought she knew me but she didnt know
That I was sad and wanted her to go
Parasite lady
Parasite eyes
Parasite lady
No need to cry
I didnt wanna have to get away
I told her things I didnt wanna say
I need her and I hope shell understand yeah
Parasite lady
Parasite eyes
Parasite lady
No need to cry
