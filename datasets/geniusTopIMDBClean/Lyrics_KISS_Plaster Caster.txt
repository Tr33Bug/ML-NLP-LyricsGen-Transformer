Babys getting anxious the hours getting late
The night is almost over she cant wait
Oh things are complicating my love is in her hands
And theres no more waiting she understands
The plasters gettin harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love
For her collection her collection
Plaster caster grab a hold of me faster
And if you wanna see my love just ask her
And my love is the plaster yeah shes the collector
She wants me all the time to inject her
The plasters gettin harder
And my love is perfection
A token of my love

Plaster caster  Plaster caster 
Grab a hold of me faster  Plaster faster 
And if you wanna see my love just ask her  Ask her

The plasters gettin harder
And my love is perfection

Plaster caster  Plaster caster 
Grab a hold of me faster  Plaster faster 
If you wanna see my love just ask her  Ask her
