YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Hello
Here I am
Here we are we are one
Ive been waiting for this night to come
Get up
Now its time for me to take my place
The makeup running down my face
Were exiled from the human race
Youre in the psy
Youre in the psycho circus
Youre in the psy
Youre in the psycho circus
And I say Welcome to the show
Ive been waiting here to be your guide
So come
Reveal the secrets that you keep inside
Step up
No one leaves until the night is done
The amplifiers start to hum
The carnival has just begun
Welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
The show
I Ive been waiting here to be your guide
So come
Reveal the secrets that you keep inside
Step up
No one leaves until the night is done
The amplifiers start to hum
The carnival has just begun


Youre in the psy
Youre in the psycho circus
Youre in the psy
Youre in the psycho circus
Youre in the psy
Youre in the psycho circus
Youre in the psy
Youre in the psycho circus
And I say Welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
Welcome to the show
And I say Welcome to the show
