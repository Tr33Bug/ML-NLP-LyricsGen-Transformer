Out of love theres nobody around
All I hear is the sound of a broken heart
Out of time no more waiting for you
Now the hurting is through and a new day starts
And I feel a change in my life
I sailed into dark and endless nights
And made it alive
Everybodys got a reason to live baby
Everybodys got a dream and a hunger inside
Everybodys got a reason to live but it cant be your love
Out of touch with myself for so long
Now a feelin so strong coming over me
Down the line theres a lesson Ive learned
You can love and get burned if it has to be
And I see a change in my life
And Im not alone when Im strong inside
And I realize
And I feel a change in my life
And Im not alone when Im strong inside and I realize
No it cant be your love no it cant be your love
No it cant be your love
