I cant wait a day
I dont care what you say
Oh yeah you got to pay
When you hit rock bottom
And youre there to stay
Sometimes late at night
I want to hold you tight
Oh no you gotta pay
Girl you hit rock bottom
And youre there to stay
Rock bottom
Girl you know you oughta treat me good
Rock bottom
Oh you never treat me like you should
Hard times got me down
Good times aint around
Now I got the mind to say
Girl you hit rock bottom
And youre there to stay
Rock bottom
Girl you know you oughta treat me good
Rock bottom
Yeah you never treat me like you should
Rock bottom
Girl you know you oughta treat me good
Rock bottom
Yeah you never treat me like you should
Rock bottom
Rock bottom ow
