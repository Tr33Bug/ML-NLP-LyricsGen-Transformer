Your lightnings all I need
My satisfaction grows
You make me feel at ease
You even make me glow
Dont cut the power on me
Im feeling low so get me high
Shock me  Make me feel better 
Shock me  Put on your black leather 
Shock me  We can come together 
And baby if you do what youve been told
My insulations gone
Girl you make me overload
Dont pull the plug on me no no
Keep it in and keep me high
Shock me  Make me feel better 
Shock me  Put on your black leather 
Shock me  We can come together 
Cmon
Shock me  Baby 
Shock me  Oh yeah 
Shock me  Baby 
Shock me  Oh yeah 
Shock me  Make me feel better oh yeah 
Come on and shock me  Put on your black leather baby 
Im down to the bare wire
Shock me  We can come together oh yeah 
I wanna feel your power


Shock me  Make me feel better oh yeah 
Im down to the bare wire
Shock me  Put on your black leather baby 
Come on come on shock me
