Well the nights begun and you want some fun
Do you think youre gonna find it  Think youre gonna find it 
You got to treat yourself like number one
Do you need to be reminded  Need to be reminded 
It doesnt matter what you do or say
Just forget the things that youve been told
We cant do it any other way
Everybodys got to rock and roll whoa whoa
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
If you dont feel good theres a way you could
Dont sit there brokenhearted  Sit there brokenhearted 
Call all your friends in the neighborhood
And get the party started  Get the party started 
Dont let em tell you that theres too much noise
Theyre too old to really understand
Youll still get rowdy with the girls and boys
Cause its time for you to take a stand yeah yeah
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
Youve got to have a party 
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
Turn it up louder 
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
And everybody shout it now 
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
Oh yeah 

Shout it shout it shout it out loud
I hear it getting louder 
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
And everybody shout it now 
Shout it shout it shout it out loud
Whoo
