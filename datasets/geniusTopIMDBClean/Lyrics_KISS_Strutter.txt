I know a thing or two about her
I know shell only make you cry
Shell let you walk the street beside her ooh
But when she wants shell pass you by
Everybody says shes lookin good
And the lady knows its understood
Strutter
She wears her satins like a lady
She gets her way just like a child
You take her home and she says Maybe baby
She takes you down and drives you wild
Everybody says shes lookin good
And the lady knows its understood
Strutter
I know a thing or two about her
I know shell only make you cry
Shell let you walk the street beside her
But when she wants shell pass you by ow
Everybody says shes lookin good
And the lady knows its understood
Strutter
Strutter
Strutter
