Sure Know Something Lyrics
I been up and down, I been all around
I was mystified, almost terrified
But late at night I still hear you call my name
I been on my own, I've been all alone
I was hypnotized, I felt paralyzed
But late at night I still want you just the same

I've been a gambler, but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something, sure know something
You showed me things they never taught me in school
And I sure know something, sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something, uh-huh
I was seventeen, you were just a dream
I was mesmerized, I felt scared inside
You broke my heart and I still can't feel the pain
I've been counted out, I've had fear and doubt
I've been starry-eyed, never satisfied
'Cause late at night, I still need you just the same
(Just the same)

I've been a gambler, but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something, sure know something
You showed me things they never taught me in school
And I sure know something, sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something, uh-huh

Ahh
Ahh
Ahh

I've been counted out, I've had fear and doubt
I've been starry-eyed, never satisfied
'Cause late at night I still need you just the same
(Just the same) Yeah

I've been a gambler, but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something, sure know something
You showed me things they never taught me in school
And I sure know something, sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
(And I sure know something, sure know something)
No one can tell me till I hear it from you
(And I sure know something, sure know something)
I've been a gambler, but I'm nobody's fool
(Sure know something, sure know something)
You showed me things they never taught me in school
(Sure know something, sure know something)
No one can make me feel the way that you do4Embed
