I been up and down I been all around
I was mystified almost terrified
But late at night I still hear you call my name
I been on my own Ive been all alone
I was hypnotized I felt paralyzed
But late at night I still want you just the same
Ive been a gambler but Im nobodys fool
And I sure know something sure know something
You showed me things they never taught me in school
And I sure know something sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something uhhuh
I was seventeen you were just a dream
I was mesmerized I felt scared inside
You broke my heart and I still cant feel the pain
Ive been counted out Ive had fear and doubt
Ive been starryeyed never satisfied
Cause late at night I still need you just the same
Just the same 
Ive been a gambler but Im nobodys fool
And I sure know something sure know something
You showed me things they never taught me in school
And I sure know something sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something uhhuh
Ahh
Ahh
Ahh
Ive been counted out Ive had fear and doubt
Ive been starryeyed never satisfied
Cause late at night I still need you just the same
Just the same  Yeah


Ive been a gambler but Im nobodys fool
And I sure know something sure know something
You showed me things they never taught me in school
And I sure know something sure know something
No one can make me feel the way that you do
And I sure know something sure know something 
No one can tell me till I hear it from you
And I sure know something sure know something 
Ive been a gambler but Im nobodys fool
Sure know something sure know something 
You showed me things they never taught me in school
Sure know something sure know something 
No one can make me feel the way that you do
