I was there through the ages
Chained slaves to their cages
I have seen you eat your own
Im the cycle of pain
Of a thousand year old reign
Im suicide and salvation
The omen to nations
That you worship on all fours
Im the infection and famine
Thats knocking at your door
Thats why youre feeling so
Unholy
Oh I was created by man you know Im
Unholy
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I am the incubus
I lay the egg in you
The worm that burrows
Through your brain
But you are the beast
That calls me by my name
You send your children to war
To serve bastards and whores
So now you know
You created me
On the day that you were born
Unholy
I was created by man
Yeah Im the Lord of the flies you know Im
Unholy
From the left hand of power comes the father of lies yeah
Unholy unholy


I lay you down to sleep
Your soul to keep
Better cross your heart before you die
And now you know
Know that you are mine
Thats why youre feeling so
Unholy unholy unholy unholy
