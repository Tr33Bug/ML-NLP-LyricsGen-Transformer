Unholy Lyrics
I was there through the ages
Chained slaves to their cages
I have seen you eat your own
I'm the cycle of pain
Of a thousand year old reign
I'm suicide and salvation
The omen to nations
That you worship on all fours
I'm the infection and famine
That's knocking at your door
That's why you're feeling so
Unholy
Oh, I was created by man, you know I'm
Unholy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I am the incubus
I lay the egg in you
The worm that burrows
Through your brain
But you are the beast
That calls me by my name
You send your children to war
To serve bastards and whores
So now you know
You created me
On the day that you were born

Unholy
I was created by man
Yeah I'm the Lord of the flies, you know I'm
Unholy
From the left hand of power comes the father of lies, yeah
Unholy, unholy!
You might also like

I lay you down to sleep
Your soul to keep
Better cross your heart before you die
And now you know
Know that you are mine

That's why you're feeling so
Unholy, unholy, unholy, unholy!Embed
