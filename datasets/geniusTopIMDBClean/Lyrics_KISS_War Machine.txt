Want to bite the hand that feeds me want to turn the tides
Set the demons free and watch them fly
Strike down the one who leads me Im going to take his place
Going to vindicate the human race
Better watch out because Im a war machine
Better watch out because Im a war machine
Take the reins of power and seize them
Draw the battle lines
Armageddons just a matter of time
Tear down the voice of reason let the arrows fly
Your freedoms just a state of mind yeah
Better watch out because Im a war machine
Better watch out because Im a war machine
Better watch out because Im a war machine
Better watch out because Im a war machine
Better watch out because Im a war machine
Better watch out because Im a war machine
