Pocket Calculator LyricsI'm the operator
With my pocket calculator
I'm the operator
With my pocket calculator
I am adding
And subtracting
I'm controlling
And composing
I'm the operator
With my pocket calculator
I'm the operator
With my pocket calculator
I am adding
And subtracting
I'm controlling
And composing
By pressing down a special key
It plays a little melody
By pressing down a special key
It plays a little melody
I'm the operator
With my pocket calculator
I'm the operator
With my pocket calculatorYou might also like1Embed
