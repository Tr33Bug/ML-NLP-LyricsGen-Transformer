Radioactivity  The Mix Version  Lyrics            
Chernobyl Harrisburg Sellafield Hiroshima
Chernobyl Harrisburg Sellafield Hiroshima
Stop radioactivity
Is in the air for you and me
Stop radioactivity
Discovered by Madame Curie
Chain reaction and mutation
Contaminated population
Stop radioactivity
Is in the air for you and me
Radioactivity
Radioactivity
Chernobyl Harrisburg Sellafield Hiroshima
Chernobyl Harrisburg Sellafield Hiroshima
Stop radioactivity
Is in the air for you and me
Stop radioactivity
Discovered by Madame Curie
Chain reaction and mutation
Contaminated population
Stop radioactivity
Is in the air for you and me
