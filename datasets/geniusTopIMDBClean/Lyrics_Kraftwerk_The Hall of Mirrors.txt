The young man stepped into the hall of mirrors
Where he discovered a reflection of himself
Even the greatest stars
Discover themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Discover themselves in the looking glass
Sometimes he saw his real face
And sometimes a stranger at his place
Even the greatest stars
Find their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Find their face in the looking glass
He fell in love with the image of himself
And suddenly the picture was distorted
Even the greatest stars
Dislike themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Dislike themselves in the looking glass
He made up the person he wanted to be
And changed into a new personality
Even the greatest stars
Change themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Change themselves in the looking glass
The artist is living in the mirror
With the echoes of himself
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Fix their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Fix their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
