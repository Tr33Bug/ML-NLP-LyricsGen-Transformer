The Telephone Call Lyrics
I give you my affection and I give you my time
Trying to get a connection on the telephone line

You're so close but far away
I call you up all night and day

I give you my affection and I give you my time
Trying to get a connection on the telephone line
You're so close but far away
I call you up all night and day
You're so close but far away
I call you up all night and day

I give you my affection and I give you my time
Trying to get a connection on the telephone line
I call you up from time to time
To hear your voice on the telephone line
I call you up from time to time
To hear your voice on the telephone lineYou might also likeEmbed
