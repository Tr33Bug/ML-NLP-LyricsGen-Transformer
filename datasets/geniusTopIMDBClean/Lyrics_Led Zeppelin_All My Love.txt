Should I fall out of love my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin
All of my love all of my love
All of my love to you now
All of my love all of my love
Oh all of my love to you now
The cup is raised the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word my will to sustain
For me the cloth once more to spin
Oh all of my love all of my love
Oh all of my love for you now
All of my love all of my love yes
All of my love to you child
Yours is the cloth mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind


Oh all of my love all of my love
Oh all of my love to you now
All of my love oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love all of my love
All of my love
Sometimes sometimes
Hey hey hey hey ooooh yeah
Its all all all
All of my love all of my love
All of my love to you now
All of my love all of my love
All of my love to you now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely
