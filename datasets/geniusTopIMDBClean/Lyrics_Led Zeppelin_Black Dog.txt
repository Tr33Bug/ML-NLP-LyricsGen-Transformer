Hey hey mama said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat gonna make you groove
Ah ah child way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn gonna make you sting
Hey hey baby when you walk that way
Watch y honey drip cant keep away
Oh yeah oh yeah oh oh oh
Oh yeah oh yeah oh oh oh
I gotta roll cant stand still
Got a flaming heart cant get my fill
Eyes that shine burning red
Dreams of you all through my head
Ahah ahah
Ahah ahah
Ahah ahah ahh
Hey baby oh baby pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey baby oh baby pretty baby
Move me while you groove me now
Take too long fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money took my car
Started tellin her friend she gon be a star
I dont know but Ive been told
A biglegged woman aint got no soul
Oh yeah oh yeah oh oh oh
Oh yeah oh yeah oh oh oh
All I ask for all I pray
Steady rollin woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Wont tell me no lies make me a happy man
Ahah ahah
