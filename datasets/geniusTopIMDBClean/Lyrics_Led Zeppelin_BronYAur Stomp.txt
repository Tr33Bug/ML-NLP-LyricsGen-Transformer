Ah caught you smiling at me
Thats the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree so fine
Ah all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling never sad so fine
As we walk down the country lane
Ill be singing a song hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature bout you and me
Well if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way its darkest night
The road we choose is always right so fine
Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on
As we walk down the country lanes
Ill be singing a song hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature bout you and me
My my
La la la
Come on now it aint too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Aint no companion like a blue eyed Merle
Come on now well let me tell you
What youre missing messin round them brick walls
So of one thing I am sure
Its a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door so fine
Yeah aint but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
Youre the finest dog I knew so fine
When youre old and your eyes are dim
There aint no old Shep gonna happen again
Well still go walking down country lane
Ill sing the same old song hear me call your name
