Dazed and Confused Lyrics
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

You hurt and abuse, telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again
If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

Every day I work so hard, bringing home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

... Oh, don't leave me so confused, no...
... Oh, baby

Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
Oh, yeah, all right

Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah32Embed
