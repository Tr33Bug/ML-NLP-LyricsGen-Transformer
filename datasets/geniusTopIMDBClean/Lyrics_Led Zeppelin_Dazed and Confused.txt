Been dazed and confused for so long its not true
Wanted a woman never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below yeah
You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run round sweet baby Lord how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby I dont know where youve been
Gonna love you baby here I come again
If youre going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If youre going to San Francisco
Youre gonna meet a lot of gentle people there
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hardearned pay
Try to love you baby but you push me away
Dont know where youre going only know just where youve been
Sweet little baby I want you again

Been dazed and confused for so long its not true
Wanted a woman never bargained for you

Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
