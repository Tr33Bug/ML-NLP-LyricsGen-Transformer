Oh baby
Well theres a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that cant wait for the night
I hate to think Ive been blinded baby
Why cant I see you tonight
And the warmth of your smile starts aburning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And Im shaking so much really yearning
Why dont you show up make it all right
Yeah its all right
And if you promised youd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me baby
What ever happened to you
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It aint the first time believe me baby
Im standing here feeling blue blue
Hah yeah Im blue
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
Ill watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then Im turning aroundround
The clock on the walls moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh that I found
Hey babe
Ooh Hands on the clock
Just dont seem to stop when Im thinking it over
Ooh Tired of the light
I just dont seem to find
Gotta get away get away
Ooh I see it in my dreams
But I just dont seem to be
Ive got to get all gotta get it all
Gotta get it all Ive got to get it all
Ooh now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet oh
Ive got no reason to doubt you baby
Its all a terrible mess
And Ill run in the rain till Im breathless
When Im breathless Ill run till I drop hey
The thoughts of a fools kind of careless
Im just a fool waiting on the wrong block
Oh yeah hey now
Oh hoho
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the hey now light of the hey now
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
