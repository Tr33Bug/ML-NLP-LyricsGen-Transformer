Oh baby its crying time
Oh baby I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
Cause you know I gotta get away from you babe
Oh baby the rivers red
Ah baby in my head
Theres a funny feeling going on
I dont think I can hold out long
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh baby baby when the pines begin to cry
Baby baby baby how do you feel
If the rivers run dry baby how would you feel
Craze baby the rainbows end
Mm baby its just a den for those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so babe
And when the owls cry in the night
And baby when the pines begin to cry
Oh baby baby how do you feel
If the rivers run dry baby how do you feel
Ah ah
Baby how do you feel
Ooh yeah brave I endure
Ooh yeah strong shields and lore
They cant hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby through the roads of time so long ago


Ooh yeah
Ooh ooh yeah
Ah ah ah ah
Ooh hoo
Ooh ooh
Ooh ah
