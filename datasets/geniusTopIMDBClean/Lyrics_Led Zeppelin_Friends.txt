Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I cant stop keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend she once told me
You got love you aint lonely
Now shes gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew
Mmm Im telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone whos blue now
Its very easy just
Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend theres no denying
Youre incomplete theyll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Dont let them down although it grieves you
Someday youll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew
Mmm Im telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone whos blue now
Its very easy just oh yeah
Ah nah
My my
My my
My my
My my my my my my
Im telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone whos blue now
Its very easy Its very easy
Its very easy Its easy easy yeah yeah
