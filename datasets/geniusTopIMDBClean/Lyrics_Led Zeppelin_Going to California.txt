Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me theres a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let em tell you that theyre all the same
Oh the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake  watch out 
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
Ill meet you up there where the path runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin to find a woman whos never never never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself its not as hard hard hard as it seems mm
Ah ah ah ah
