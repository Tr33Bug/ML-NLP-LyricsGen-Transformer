In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be a man
And now Ive reached that age Ive tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try I find my way into the same old jam
Good times bad times you know Ive had my share
When my woman left home for a browneyed man
But I still dont seem to care
Sixteen I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear I lost another friend oh
Good times bad times you know Ive had my share
When my woman left home for a browneyed man
But I still dont seem to care
Good times bad times you know Ive had my share
When my woman left home for a browneyed man
But I still dont seem to care
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I dont care what the neighbours say
Im gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize sweet babe we aint never gonna part
