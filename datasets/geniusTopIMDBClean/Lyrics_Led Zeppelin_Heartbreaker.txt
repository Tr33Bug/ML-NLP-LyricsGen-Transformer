Hey fellas have you heard the news
You know that Annies back in town
I wont take long just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows
Well its been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But Ill just keep on rollin along
With the grace of the Lord above
People talkin all around
Bout the way you left me flat
I dont care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify please do
Its the way you call me another guys name
When I try to make love to you yeah
I try to make love but it aint no use
Give it to me give it
Mm work so hard I couldnt unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried
Heartbreaker your time has come
Cant take your evil way
Go away heartbreaker


Heartbreaker
