Want to tell you about the girl I love
My she looks so fine
Shes the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her shes the only one I really love
I got a woman want to ball all day
I got a woman she wont be true no
I got a woman stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she wont be true
On Sunday morning when we go down to church
See the menfolk standing in line
Say they come to pray to the Lord
But when my little girl looks so fine
In the evening when the sun is sinking low
Everybodys with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep asearching all around
Looking for my streetcorner girl
I got a woman want to ball all day yeah
I got a woman she wont be true no no
I got a woman stay drunk all the time
I said I got a little woman and she wont be true
In the bars with the men who play guitars
Singing drinking and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all of the time
I guess theres just one thing aleft for me to do
Going to pack my bags and move on my way
Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Going to leave her where the guitars play
