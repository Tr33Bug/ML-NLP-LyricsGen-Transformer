Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satans daughter
And it only goes to show
You know
Theres an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love Ill sow
You know
So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the masters call
Oh Satan and man
Said there aint no use in crying
Cause it will only only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying
Was this the only world you had Oh oh
So let me take you take you to the movie
Can I take you baby to the show
Why dont you let me be your ever truly
Can I make your garden grow
You know thats right
