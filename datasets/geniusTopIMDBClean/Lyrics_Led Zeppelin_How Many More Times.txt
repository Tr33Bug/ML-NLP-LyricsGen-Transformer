Aaahhhhh
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do
When I give you all my love
Please please be true
Ill give you all Ive got to give rings pearls and all
Ill give you all Ive got to give rings pearls and all
Ive got to get you together baby
Im sure sure youre gonna call
Oh whens the last time I done asked you
I was a young man I couldnt resist
Started thinking it over just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops oh no yeah well I did it again
Now I got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven
But Im in constant heaven
I know its all right in my mind
Cause I got a little schoolgirl and shes all mine
I cant get through to her cause it doesnt permit
But Im gonna give her everything Ive got to give
Oh Rosie oh girl
Oh Rosie oh girl
Steal away now steal away
Steal away baby steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why dont you come to me baby
Steal away all right all right
Well they call me the hunter
Thats my name
They call me the hunter
Thats how I got my fame
Aint no need to hide
Aint no need to run
Cause Ive got you in the sights of my gun


How many more times barrel house all night long all right
How many more times barrel house all night long
Well Ive got to get to you baby
So please come home
Why dont you listen to me baby
Why dont you please come home
Why dont you please come home
Why dont you please come home
