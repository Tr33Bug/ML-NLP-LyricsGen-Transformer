Oh I cant quit you babe
So Im gonna put you down for awhile
I said I cant quit you babe
I guess I got to put you down for awhile
Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Yes you did babe oh
Said you know I love you baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh you know I love you babe
My love for you I could never hide
Oh when I feel you near me little girl
I know you are my one desire yeah
Oh ooohh yeah
When you hear me moaning and groaning baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh when you hear me moaning and groaning babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh when you hear me holler baby
You know youre my one desire
Yes you are ohh
