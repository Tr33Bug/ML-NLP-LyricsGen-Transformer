Oh let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ooooh
Oh baby I been flying
No yeah mama there aint no denying
Oh ooh yeah Ive been flying
Mama mama aint no denying no denying
Oh all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find trying to find where Ive been
Oh pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My ShangriLa beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin through Kashmir
Oh father of the four winds fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ooh
Ooooh
Oh when Im on when Im on my way yeah
When I see when I see the way you stay yeah
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah when Im down yeah
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah but Im down so down
Ooh my baby ooh my baby let me take you there
Oh oh  come on come on oh let me take you there let me take you there
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah let me take you there let me take you there
