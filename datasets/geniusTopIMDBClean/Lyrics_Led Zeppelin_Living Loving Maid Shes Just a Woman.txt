Living Loving Maid  Shes Just a Woman  Lyrics
With a purple umbrella and a fiftycent hat
Living loving shes just a woman
Missus Cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Living loving shes just a woman
Come on babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merrygoround
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down
Alimony alimony paying your bills
Living loving shes just a woman
When your conscience hits you knock it back with pills
Living loving shes just a woman
Come on babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merrygoround
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down
Telling tall tales of how it used to be
Living loving shes just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Living loving shes just a woman
Ah get it now get it
Ooo you got it
Nobody hears a single word you say
Living loving shes just a woman
But you keep on talking till your dying day
Living loving shes just a woman
Come on babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merrygoround
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down
Living loving shes just a woman
Living living loving loving shes just a woman
Lililililive lololololove shes just a woman
