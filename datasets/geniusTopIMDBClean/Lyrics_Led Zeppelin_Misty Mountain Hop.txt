Walking in the park just the other day baby
What do you what do you think I saw
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey boy do you wanna score
And you know how it is
I really dont know what time it was
Woah oh oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while
I didnt notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
Asked us said please hey would we care
To all get in line get in line
Well you know they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh oh oh
He said that his friends would all drop by ooh
Why dont you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see
And baby baby baby do you like it
There you sit sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah Not trying to fight it
You really dont care if theyre coming
Oh oh oh
I know that its all a state of mind ooh  No no no 
If you go down in the streets
Today baby you better
You better open your eyes woah yeah
Folk down there really dont care
Really dont care dont care really dont
Which which way the pressure lies
So Ive decided what Im going to do now
So Im packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I really dont know oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really dont know oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I really dont know
