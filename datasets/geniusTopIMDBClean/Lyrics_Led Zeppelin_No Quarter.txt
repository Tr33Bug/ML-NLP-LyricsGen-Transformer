Close the door put out the light
You know they wont be home tonight oh oh
The snow falls hard and dont you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
Theyre wearing steel thats bright and true
They carry news that must get through
They choose the path where noone goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter
Aaaah
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step ooh
The snow drives back the foot thats slow
The dogs of doom are howling more oh
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you oh
They choose the path where noone goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Oh
The pain the pain without quarter oh yeah
They ask no quarter  Without quarter quarter quarter 
They give no quarter  Giving me giving me no 
Oh  I hear the dogs of doom are howling more
