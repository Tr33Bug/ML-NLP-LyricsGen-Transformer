Hey lady you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling darling darling walk a while with me
Oh youve got so much so much so much
Many have I loved and many times been bitten
Many times Ive gazed along the open road
Many times Ive lied and many times Ive listened
Many times Ive wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold
Mellow is the man who knows what hes been missing
Many many men cant see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing bout a thing you really ought to know oh oh oh oh
Really ought to know  oh oh oh 
I really ought to know
Ohwhoa you know I should you know I should
You know I shouldve known
