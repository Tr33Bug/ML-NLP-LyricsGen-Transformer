The leaves are falling all around time I was on my way
Thanks to you Im much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now its time for me to go the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain and with it pain and its headed my way
Ah sometimes I grow so tired
But I know Ive got one thing I got to do
Ramble on and nows the time the time is now
To sing my song Im going round the world I gotta find my girl
On my way Ive been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on gotta find the queen of all my dreams
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though Our health we drank a thousand times
Its time to ramble on
Ramble on and now the time the time is now
To sing my song Im going round the world I gotta find my girl
On my way Ive been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on I gotta find the queen of all my dreams
I tell you no lie
Mines a tale that cant be told my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old when magic filled the air
Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her her yeah
Ah theres nothing I can do now
I guess Ill keep on
Ramblin Im gonna shake  Sing my song 
I gotta find my baby
Im gonna ramble on sing my song
Gonna work my way going round the world
Baby baby  Ramble on 
Do do do do do do do do my baby
I cant stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think We gots to part
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby baby baby baby baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My my my my my my baby
I cant find my bluebird
I listened to what my bluebird said but I I cant find my bluebird
I keep rambling baby
