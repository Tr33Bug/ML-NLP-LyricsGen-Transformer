Its been a long time since I rock and rolled
Its been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh let me get it back let me get it back
Let me get it back baby where I come from
Its been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time
Yes it has
Its been a long time since The Book of Love
I cant count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back carry me back
Carry me back baby where I come from
Whoa whoa oh
Its been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time
Ahhh  Ahhh
Oh Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just cant work right
Oh yeah open your arms open your arms
Open your arms baby let my love come running in
Yeah
Its been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time
Yeah yeah

Ooh yeah ooh yeah
Ooh yeah ooh yeah
Its been a long time been a long time
Been a long lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely time
