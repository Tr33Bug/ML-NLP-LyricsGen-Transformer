Theres a lady whos sure all that glitters is gold
And shes buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh ooh and shes buying a stairway to Heaven
Theres a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook theres a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh it  makes me wonder
Ooh makes me wonder
Theres a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Ooh it makes me wonder
Ooh really makes me wonder
And its whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
Ohohohohwoahhh
If theres a bustle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed now
Its just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
Theres still time to change the road youre on
And it makes me wonder
Ohh woah
Your head is humming and it wont go in case you dont know
The pipers calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And shes buying a stairway to Heaven
