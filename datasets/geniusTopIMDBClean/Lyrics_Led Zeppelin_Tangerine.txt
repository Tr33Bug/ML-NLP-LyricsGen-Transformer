One two
One two three four
One two
Measuring a summers day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours they bring me pain
Tangerine tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between
Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these
To think of us again
And I do
Tangerine tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between
