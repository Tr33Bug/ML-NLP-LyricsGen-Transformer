Then as it was then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune each a separate way
On the wings of maybe downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes didnt have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest got so far to go
Changes fill my time baby thats all right with me
In the midst I think of you and how it used to be
Did you ever really need somebody
And really need em bad
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had
Do you ever remember me baby
Did it feel so good
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would
Through the eyes and I sparkle senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes didnt have to grow
We are eagles of one nest the nest is in our soul
Vixen in my dreams with great surprise to me
Never thought Id see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling oh darling
Oh oh darling oh yeah oh darling


Im never going to leave you
Im never going to leave
Holding on ten years gone
Ten years gone holding on ten years gone
Im never Im never
Oooh yeah
