If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
Kind woman I give you my all
Kind woman nothing more
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die my my my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration  look see
And so today my world it smiles
Your hand in mine we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
All right yeah
Happiness no more be sad
Happiness  Im glad
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
