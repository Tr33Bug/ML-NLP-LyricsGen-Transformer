I dont know how Im going to tell you
I cant play with you no more
I dont know how Im gonna do what mama told me
My friend the boy next door
I cant believe what people saying
Youre gonna let your hair hang down
Im satisfied to sit here working all day long
Youre in the darker side of town
And when Im out I see you walking
Why dont your eyes see me
Could it be youve found another game to play
What did mama say to me
Thats the way
Oh thats the way it ought to be
Yeah yeah mama say
Thats the way it ought to stay
Yeah yeah ooooo oooo
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And werent those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry
I dont know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But nows the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay
Thats the way
Thats the way it oughtta be
Oh dont you know now mama said mama said
Thats the way its going to stay yeah
Ahh ahh ahhhh
Ahhhhhh
