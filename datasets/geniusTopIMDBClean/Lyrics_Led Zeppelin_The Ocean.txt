The Ocean Lyrics
"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh ho
Oh yeah
Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar (Ooh)
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! (Ooh)
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day (Ooh)
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way?

I don't know
Oh-oh yeah

Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na

Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day (Ooh)
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
(Ooh)
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
When the tears are going down
Yeah, yeah
