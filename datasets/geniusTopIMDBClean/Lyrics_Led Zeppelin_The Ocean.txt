Weve done four already but now were steady
And then they went One two three four
Singing in the sunshine laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags my foots outside the door
I got a date I cant be late for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh ho
Oh yeah
Singing to an ocean I can hear the oceans roar  Ooh 
Play for free play for me and play a whole lot more more  Ooh 
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day  Ooh 
I used to sing on the mountains has the ocean lost its way
I dont know
Ohoh yeah
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day  Ooh 
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away
Ooh 
Now Im singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and its a real fine way to start
Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
When the tears are going down
Yeah yeah


Oh so good
