It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth Ive felt before
It isnt hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low oooh oh
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Aint so hard to recognize oh
These things are clear to all from time to time ooh
Oh oh
Ah talk talk talk talk
Hey
Ive felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us upon us upon us
But I know that I love you so ohhhh oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah upon us all upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain oh yeah
Uhh ooooh yeah yeah yeah
