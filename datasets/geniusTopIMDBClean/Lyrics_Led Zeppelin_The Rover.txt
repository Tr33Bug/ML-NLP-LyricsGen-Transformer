Ive been to London seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it sometimes Id roll it
I always knew what it was for
There can be no denying
That the windll shake em down
And the flag were flying
Is the new flag of the land
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join
In fields of plenty
When heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call
And the wind is crying
From a love that wont grow cold
My lover she is lying
On the dark side of the globe
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You got me rocking when I ought to be arolling
Darling tell me darling which way to go
You keep me rocking baby then you keep me stalling
Wont you tell me darling which way to go thats right


Oh how I wonder oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
Of all this wonder of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show
And our time is flying
See the candle burning low
Is the new world rising
From the shambles of the old
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just if we could just if we could just
If we could just if we could just join hands
Hey Thats all it takes thats all it takes
Thats all it takes thats all it takes
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
