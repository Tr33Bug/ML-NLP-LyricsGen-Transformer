I had a dream oh yeah
Crazy dream oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song yeah
People dont you listen now
Sing along oh
You dont know what youre missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything thats small has to grow
And its gonna grow now push push yeah
Nanananana
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same ooo ooo ooh
Get it on 
Oh
Keep on
All you gotta do all you gotta do
All you gotta do now all you gotta do now
Ooh sing out Hare Hare
Ooh dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are ohso bright
As we go sliding sliding
Sliding sliding sliding sliding
