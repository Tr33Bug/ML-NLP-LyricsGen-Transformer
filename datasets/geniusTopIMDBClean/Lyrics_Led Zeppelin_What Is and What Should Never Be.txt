Take my hand child come with me

Where whats to be they say will be
Catch the wind see us spin sail away leave today
Way up high in the sky 
But the wind wont blow you really shouldnt go

Catch the wind see us spin sail away leave today
Way up high in the sky 
But the wind wont blow you really shouldnt go

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad

Way up high in the sky 
But the wind wont blow you really shouldnt go
