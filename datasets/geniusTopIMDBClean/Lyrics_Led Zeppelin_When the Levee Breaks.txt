If it keeps on raining levees going to break
If it keeps on raining the levees going to break
When the levee breaks have no place to stay
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan oh
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Its got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well oh well oh well ooh
Oh dont it make you feel bad
When youre trying to find your way home
You dont know which way to go
If youre going down south they got no work to do
If youre going north to Chicago
Ah ah ah hey
Crying wont help you praying wont do you no good
No crying wont help you praying wont do you no good
When the levee breaks mama you got to move ooh
All last night I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby and my happy home
Ohho
Ah ah ah ahah
Ah ah ah ahah
Oh oh
Going
Im going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry but I cant take you ah
Going down going down now
Going down Im going down now
Going down going down
Going down going down
Oh
Going down going down now
Going down going down now
Going down going down now
Going down going dow dow dow dow down now
Ooh ooh
