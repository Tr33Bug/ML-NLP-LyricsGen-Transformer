Lying cheating hurting thats all you seem to do
Messing around every guy in town
Putting me down for thinking of someone new
Always the same playing your game
Drive me insane trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it wont be long
Youll look for me but baby Ill be gone
This is all I gotta say to you woman
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Made up my mind break you this time
Wont be so fine its my turn to cry
Do what you want I wont take the brunt
Its fading away cant feel you anymore
Dont care what you say cause Im going away to stay
Going to make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talking all around
Watch out woman no longer
Is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me woman
But its coming back home to you
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come  Byebye baby 
Your time is gonna come  Byebye byebye 
Your time is gonna come   
Your time is gonna come  Oh oh ohoh 
Your time is gonna come   
Your time is gonna come   
Your time is gonna come
