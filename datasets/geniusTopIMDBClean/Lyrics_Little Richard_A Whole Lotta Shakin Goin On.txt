A Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On Lyrics
I said come on over baby, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Yeah I said come on over baby, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Well we aren't faking, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on

Mmm, I said come on over baby, we got chickens in the barn
Whose barn, what barn, my barn
I said come on over baby, we got the bull by the horns
Yeah, we aren't faking, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Well, I said shake baby, shake
I said shake, baby shake now
I said shake it baby, shake
I said shake it baby, shake
We aren't faking, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on

I said come on over baby, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Yeah I said come on over baby, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Well we aren't faking, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on

Well my mom-mom-mom, I said shake baby, shake
I said shake baby, shake it
I said shake baby, shake all right
I said shake baby, shake
We aren't faking, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on

I said come on over baby, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Yeah I said come on over baby, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Well we aren't faking, a-whole lot-ta shaking going on
Easy now
