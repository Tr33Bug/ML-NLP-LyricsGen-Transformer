All around the world rock and roll is on its way
All around the world rock and roll is on its way
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day
All the flattop cats
With the rock and roll queens
Just rockin and rollin
In their red and blue jeans
All around the world rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day
Aint never no time for romance
They only wanna dance
The people all holla when they hit that floor
Go cat go
All around the world rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day
They do the Baja
The Texas haha
Shim sham shimmy
And they never ever stop
All around the world rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day


Aint never no time for romance
They only wanna dance
The people all holla when they hit that floor
Go cat go
All around the world rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day
