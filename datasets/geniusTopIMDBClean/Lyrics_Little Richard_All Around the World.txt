All Around the World Lyrics
All around the world, rock and roll is on its way
All around the world, rock and roll is on its way
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

All the flat-top cats
With the rock and roll queens
Just rockin' and rollin'
In their red and blue jeans
All around the world, rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

Ain't never no time for romance
They only wanna dance
The people all holla when they hit that floor
Go, cat, go

All around the world, rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

They do the Baja
The Texas haha
Shim sham shimmy
And they never ever stop

All around the world, rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day
You might also like
Ain't never no time for romance
They only wanna dance
The people all holla when they hit that floor
Go, cat, go

All around the world, rock and roll is here to stay
You can hear the jukebox jumping
All night and all through the dayEmbed
