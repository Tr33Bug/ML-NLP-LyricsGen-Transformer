All night long
All night long I think of you
All night long
All night long I think of you
Well Im worryin about my baby
But my baby wont be true
All day
All day I sit and cry
All day
All day I sit and cry
Well Im worryin about my baby
How my baby pass me by
Ow sock it to em
I thank you baby
Everything you done for me
I thank you baby
Everything you done for me
Well you know that I love you
My heart is so full of misery
