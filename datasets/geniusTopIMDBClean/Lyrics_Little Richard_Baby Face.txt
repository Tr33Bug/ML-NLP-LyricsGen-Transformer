Hmm baby face
Youve got the cutest little hmm baby face
Theres not another who could take your place
Hmm baby face my poor heart is jumpin
You sure have started somethin
Hmm baby face
Im up in heaven when Im in your firm embrace
Might need a shove
Because I fell in love
With your pretty baby face

Youve got the cutest little hmm baby face
Theres not another who could take your place
Hmm baby face my poor heart is jumpin
You should have started somethin
Hmm baby face
Im up in heaven when Im in your firm embrace
Might need a shove
Because I fell in love
With your pretty baby face
