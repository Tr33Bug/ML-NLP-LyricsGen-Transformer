Baby Face Lyrics
Hmm, baby face
You've got the cutest little, hmm, baby face
There's not another who could take your place
Hmm, baby face, my poor heart is jumpin'
You sure have started somethin'

Hmm, baby face
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
Might need a shove
Because I fell in love
With your pretty baby face
Hmm, baby face
You've got the cutest little, hmm, baby face
There's not another who could take your place
Hmm, baby face, my poor heart is jumpin'
You should have started somethin'

Hmm, baby face
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
Might need a shove
Because I fell in love
With your pretty baby face

Hmm, baby face
You've got the cutest baby face
There's not another who can take your place
Baby face, my poor heart is jumpin'
You should have started somethin'

Baby face
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace
Might need a shove
Because I fell in love
With your pretty baby faceYou might also likeEmbed
