Bama Lama Bama Loo Lyrics
Bama lama bama loo

Got a girl named Lucinda
We call her the great pretender, whoo
Got a girl named Lucinda
We call her the great pretender
And when she talks, she says "Bama lama loo"

Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo, whoo
Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo
Now I dig her style, she's like a drive me wild with
Bama lama, bama loo
I asked my baby for kiss
She shook her head like this, whoo
I asked my little girl for kiss
She shook her head around like this
She said woo-ooh, yeah

Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo, whoo
Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo
Now I dig that style, it's driving me wild with
Bama lama, bama loo


Well, I asked my baby for kiss
She shook her head around like this, whoo
I asked my little girl for a kiss
She shook her head around like this
She said, "Whoo, ooh ooh, yeah"

Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo, whoo
Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo
Now I dig that style, now I'm drivin' her wild with
Bama lama, bama looYou might also likeEmbed
