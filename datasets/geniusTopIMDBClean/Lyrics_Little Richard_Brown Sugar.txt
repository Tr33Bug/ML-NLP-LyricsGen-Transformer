Brown Sugar Lyrics
Brown sugar, you look so good to me
Brown sugar, you look so good to me

Well, gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in a market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slave knows he's doing alright
I hear him whip the women just around midnight

Brown sugar how come you taste so good?
How come you taste so good?
Ah, brown sugar, just like a young girl should
Brown sugar (Oh yeah), you look so good to me (Ah, hey)
Brown sugar (Woo-hoo-hoo), you look so good to me
Alright, alright, alright
Drums beating cold, English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wondering where it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doing alright
You should hear him scream out just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good?
How come you taste so good?
Woo, brown sugar, just like a young girl should
Brown sugar (Oh yeah), you look so good to me
(Don't you know you're looking good, you're looking good, you're looking good)
Brown sugar (Ah, yeah yeah), you look so good to me
Come on, baby, you know you're looking alright walking over there
Brown sugar (Ow), you look so good to me
(Woo-hoo, come on, brown sugar)
Brown sugar, you look so good to me
Alright

I bet your mama was a tent show queen
And all her girlfriends were sweet sixteen
I'm no school boy but I know what I like
You should have heard me screamin' just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good?
How come you taste so good?
Woo, brown sugar, just like a young girl should
How come you taste so good?
Brown sugar, just like I knew you would
How come you taste so good?
Brown sugar, just like a Black girl should
How come you taste so good?
Woo, brown sugar, hey hey, hey hey, you knew I would
How come you taste so good?
Ow, brown, sugar, you knew, I know, you know
You know I know you taste so good
How come you taste so good?You might also likeEmbed
