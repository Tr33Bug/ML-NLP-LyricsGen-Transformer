I cant believe you wanna to leave
When you know thatll hurt me so
Down on bended knee
Oh beggin please not to go
Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Dont you know that thatll drive me mad
My life my heart
My love is in your hands
And now you gonna leave me
You gonna leave me for another man
Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Dont you know thatll drive me mad
Think of all the love we shared
And all the fun we had
And now you wanna leave
Dont you know thatll drive me mad
