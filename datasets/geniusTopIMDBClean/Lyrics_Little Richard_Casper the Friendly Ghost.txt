Casper the friendly ghost
The friendliest ghost you know
Though grownups might look in anger and fright
The children all love him so
Casper the friendly ghost
He couldnt be bad or mean
You know he jump and play sing and dance all day
The friendliest ghost youve ever seen
He always say Hello
Hes really glad to meet ya
Wherever he may go
You know hes kind to every living creature
Grown ups dont understand
Why children all love him the most
But kids all know that he loves them so
Casper the friendly ghost
Casper and hes friendly
And hes friendly
Woo
Ow ow ow ow
He always say Hello
Hes always glad to meet ya
Wherever he may go
Hes kind to every living creature
Grownups dont understand
Why children all love him the most
And kids all know that he loves them so
Casper the friendly ghost
Woo
