Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Upon the mountain my Lord spoke  my Lord spoke 
Out of his mouth came fire and smoke  came fire and smoke 
When Jordans River is chilly and cold
It chills the body Lord but not the soul
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
I looked all around me and it looked so fine
I asked the Lord if all of its mine
Jesus Christ His Lord of all
Hes coming again to save us all
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart and I will pray
