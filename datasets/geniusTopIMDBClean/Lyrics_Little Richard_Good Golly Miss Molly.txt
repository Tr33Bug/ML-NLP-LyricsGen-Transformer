Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and rolling
Cant hear your mama call
From the early early morning
To the early early night
When you caught Miss Molly
Rocking at the House of Blue Lights
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and rolling
Cant hear your mama call
Momma Papa told me
Son you better watch your step
If they knew about Miss Molly
Id have to watch my pa myself
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and rolling
Cant hear your mama call
Ahhhhh
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
Oh when youre rocking and rolling
Cant hear your mama call
Going to the corner
Gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you hug me and kiss me
Make me tingalingaling
Good Golly Miss Molly sure like to ball
When youre rocking and rolling
Cant hear your mama call
