Well Ive been on the road
For a long time
Met a lot of women
Had to leave them all behind
Because I want to go back
To the land I love
Where Magnolia smells sweet
And white cotton is warm
Take me on back
Back to the country
Take me on down down
Greenwood Mississippi
Old farmer John
He lives down the road
Works in the fields
Carrying a heavy load
He dont have to worry
About a thing
Because evryday now
You can hear him sing
