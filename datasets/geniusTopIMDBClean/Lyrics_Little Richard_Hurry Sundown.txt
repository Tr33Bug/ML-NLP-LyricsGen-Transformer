Hurry down
Hurry down sun
Hurry down
I said sun
Wont you hurry on on down
Let the weary day be over
Im so tired of the hurt
Ive been taking my heart has been aching so
Dont mind struggling
I dont mind livin on a little
If someday my kids
Are laughing together
And having things that I never own
I can feel the change acoming
Freedom drums in the distance they are drumming
Telling the world of a brand new future has begun
So you gotta hurry sundown
I cant wait to see the morning
Theres a lot of work
I must lend a hand to
So bring on that new day
A great tomorrow is on its way
Hurry sundown 
Hurry sundown 
Hurry down sundown
Hurry sundown 
Hurry down sundown
Hurry sundown 
Hurry sundown 
Hurry down sundown
