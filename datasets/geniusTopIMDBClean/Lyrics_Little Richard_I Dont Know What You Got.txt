You never treat me kind
Youre poor honey all the time
You doin me me no good
Id leave you if I only could
Baby I dont know what you got
Honey I dont know what you got
But its got me
I believe its got me
You not very very much to look at
But you know just where its at
You dont have one thin dime
Still I cant leave you behind
Baby I dont know what you got
Honey I dont know what you got
But its got me
Im tellin you its got me
Baby baby baby I feel so all alone
Sometimes I just cry I sigh
Sometimes I even moan
Because baby I dont know what it is
But I find myself living at your will
Oh baby please
Sometimes my best friend comes to me on my job
And he looks at me and he said
Richard man you dont know whats going on
And I look at my friend because Im innocent
And my friend look at me and says
Richard you dont know whats going on
I got something to tell you
And look what my friend tells me
This what he say to me


Now you cheat cheat cheat cheat on me
But baby let me be
Honey I dont know what you got
Baby I dont know what you got
But its got me
I cry sometimes because I know its got me
Listen I gave you all the money I had in the bank
Not one time not one time did you say thanks
But baby I dont know what you got
Honey I say I dont know what you got
Sometimes it makes my cry
I dont know what you got
I feel sometimes like I wanna to die
I dont oh oh oh baby
Sometimes it makes me wanna moan
Sometimes it makes me wanna leave my happy home
