Theres a little man with a billygoat cart
People say hes crazy but I say hes smart
You can see him every day goin up and down the street
Always howling about somethin good to eat
I got it oh baby I got it
Oh baby I got it
Cant do without it
Well blackeyed peas and the buttered beans
Fresh milk and corn and the collard greens
I got it woo baby I got it
Baby I got it
I cant do without it
It aint what you do its the way how you do it
It aint what eat its the way how you chew it
I got it ooh baby I got it
Ooh baby I got it
I cant do without it
Smoked ham eggs and jam
Corn bread and candied yams
I got it ooh baby I got it
Baby I got it
I cant do without it
Well blackeyed peas and the buttered beans
Fresh milk and corn and the collard greens
I got it oh baby I got it
Baby I got it
I cant do without it
Well it aint what you do its the way how you do it
It aint what eat its the way how you chew it
I got it oh baby I got it
Baby I got it
I cant do without it
