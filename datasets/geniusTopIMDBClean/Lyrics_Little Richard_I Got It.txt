I Got It LyricsThere's a little man with a billy-goat cart
People say he's crazy but I say he's smart
You can see him every day goin' up and down the street
Always howling about somethin' good to eat
I got it, oh baby I got it
Oh baby I got it
Can't do without it
Well, black-eyed peas and the buttered beans
Fresh milk and corn and the collard greens
I got it, woo baby I got it
Baby I got it
I can't do without it
It ain't what you do, it's the way how you do it
It ain't what eat, it's the way how you chew it
I got it, ooh baby I got it
Ooh baby I got it
I can't do without it
Smoked ham, eggs and jam
Corn bread and candied yams
I got it, ooh baby I got it
Baby I got it
I can't do without it
Well, black-eyed peas and the buttered beans
Fresh milk and corn and the collard greens
I got it, oh baby I got it
Baby I got it
I can't do without it
Well, it ain't what you do, it's the way how you do it
It ain't what eat, it's the way how you chew it
You might also likeI got it, oh baby I got it
Baby I got it
I can't do without itEmbed
