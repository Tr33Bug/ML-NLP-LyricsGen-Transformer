I dont know what youve got but its got me  parts 1  2  LyricsI Dont Know What Youve Got But Its Got Me
By Little Richard
You never treat me kind youre poor honey all the time
You do me me no good Ill leave you if only could
Baby I dont know what you got
Honey I dont know what you got but its got me I believe its got me
You not very very much to look at but you know just where its at
You dont have one thing at night still I cant leave you behind
Baby I dont know what you got
Honey I dont know what you got but its got me Im telling you its got me
Baby baby baby I feel so all alone sometimes I just crawl outside
Sometimes I even moan because baby
I dont know what it is but I find myself living at your will
Ah baby please sometimes my best friend comes to me on my job
And he looks at me and he said Richard man you dont know whats going on
And I look at my friend because Im innocent and my friend look at me
And says Richard you dont know whats going on I got something to tell ya
And look what my friend tells me this what he say to me
I know you cheat cheat cheat on me but baby let me be
Honey I dont know what you got baby I dont know what you got
But its got me I cry sometimes because I know its got me
Listen I gave you all the money I had in the bank
Not one time not one time did you say thanks
But baby I dont know what you got honey I say
I dont know what you got sometimes it makes my cry
I dont know what you got honey I say
I feel sometimes like Im gonna die I dont know what you got oh ooh baby
Sometimes it makes me wanna moan
Sometimes it makes me wanna leave my happy home ooh ooh
Sometimes I just moan wooh wooh
Sometimes it make me wanna cry wooh yeah
I said baby I said baby wooh I need you I know its not me its really not me
