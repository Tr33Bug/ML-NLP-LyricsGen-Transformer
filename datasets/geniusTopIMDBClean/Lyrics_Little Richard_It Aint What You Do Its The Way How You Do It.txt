It Ain’t What You Do (It’s The Way How You Do It) Lyrics
Well now, it ain't what you do
It's the way how you do it
It ain't what you eat
It's the way how you treat it

Be it large, or be it small
Do it well, or not at all

Well, if the shoes don't fit you
You better not force it
If you can't take it
Sure can't make it
Be it large, or be it small
Do it well, or not at all


Be it large, or be it small
Do it well, or not at all

Well, if the shoes don't fit you
You better not force it
If you can't take it
Sure can't make it

Be it large, or be it small
Do it well, or not at allYou might also likeEmbed
