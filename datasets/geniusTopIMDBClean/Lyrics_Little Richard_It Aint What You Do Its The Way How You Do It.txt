It Aint What You Do  Its The Way How You Do It  Lyrics
Well now it aint what you do
Its the way how you do it
It aint what you eat
Its the way how you treat it
Be it large or be it small
Do it well or not at all
Well if the shoes dont fit you
You better not force it
If you cant take it
Sure cant make it
Be it large or be it small
Do it well or not at all
Be it large or be it small
Do it well or not at all
Well if the shoes dont fit you
You better not force it
If you cant take it
Sure cant make it
Be it large or be it small
Do it well or not at all
