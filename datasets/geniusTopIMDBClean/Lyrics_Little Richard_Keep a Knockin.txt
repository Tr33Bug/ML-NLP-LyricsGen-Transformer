Keep a Knockinâ€™ Lyrics
Keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again

You said you love me and you can't come in
You said you love me and you can't come in, woo!
You said you love me and you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again
Woo

Keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again

You said you love me and you can't come in
You said you love me and you can't come in
You said you love me and but you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again


You keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Keep a knockin', but you can't, woo!
Keep a knockin', but you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again

You said you love me and you can't come in
You said you love me and you can't come in
You said you love me and you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it againYou might also likeEmbed
