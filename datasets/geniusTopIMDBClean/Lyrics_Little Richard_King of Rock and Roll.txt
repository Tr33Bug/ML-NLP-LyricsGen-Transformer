And it came to pass
That in the year of rock and superstars
King Richard returned from exile to claim his throne
And from around the world the cry was
The King The King King Richard is back
Long live the king Long live the king
King Richard is back the king King Richard is back
Long live the king Long live the king
Good golly Miss Molly go and tell everybody
Every Johnny Joe and Jack that the king is back
We gonna let it reetydeety gonna let it all burn
Gonna have a celebration for the king returns
Im the king of rock and roll
Im the king of rock and roll
Now Im gonna sing and shout it
There aint no doubt about it
Im the king of rock and roll
Tom Jones said that daddy in 
But I can beat his  with my king sized 
Ike and Tina Turner got an earthquake sound
But Im the man from Macon and Im gonna put em down
Elvis Presley have you heard the news
Im gonna walk over your blue suede shoes
One and two Three Dog Night
I bet your bark is much bigger than your bite
Creedence Clearwater
Dont you know your honor
Tell Sly and the Stone to leave rock and roll alone
Aretha Franklin is the queen of soul
But who wants to be the queen
When youre the king of rock and roll
