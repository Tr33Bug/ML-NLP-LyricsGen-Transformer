Land of a Thousand Dances Lyrics
One, two, three
One, two, three, oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh

You got to know how to Pony
Like Bony Moronie
You got to Mashed Potatoes
You got to do The Alligator now
Put your hand on your hip, yeah
Let your backbone slip
Now do the Watusi
Like my little Lucy
Ow
Feel pretty good, y'all?
Feel alright now

Na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
I need somebody to help me now
Na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Ow

You got to do the Jerk now
I'd like to see you work, y'all
Now go low on your back
I said I like it like that
Now do the Philly Dog
I'd like to smoke your hog now
Now duck back in the alley
Like Long Tall Sally
Ow
You might also like
Feeling pretty good?
I feel alright now

Na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
I need somebody to help me now
Na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Ow

Doing the Watusi
Like my little Lucy
Put your hands on your hip, yeah
Let your backbone slip now

Ow, do it
Ow, do it
Ow, do it
Ow, help me
Ow, help me
Somebody help me
Somebody help me
Oh, yeah
Any thousand dances
Do anything you wannaEmbed
