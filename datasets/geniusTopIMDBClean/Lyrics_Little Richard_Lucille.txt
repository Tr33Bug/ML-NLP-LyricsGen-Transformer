Lucille you wont do your sisters will
Oh Lucille you wont do your sisters will
You ran off and married but I love you still
Lucille please come back where you belong
Lucille please come back where you belong
Ive been good to you baby please dont leave me alone
I woke up this morning Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight
Lucille please come back where you belong
Ive been good to you baby please dont leave me alone whoah
I woke up this morning Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight

I played for it baby and gave you such a wonderful start
