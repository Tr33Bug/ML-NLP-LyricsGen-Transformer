Lucille you wont do your sisters will
Oh Lucille you wont do your sisters will
You ran off and married but I love you still
Lucille please come back where you belong
Lucille please come back where you belong
Ive been good to you baby please dont leave me alone
I woke up this morning Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight
Lucille please come back where you belong
Ive been good to you baby please dont leave me alone whoah
I woke up this morning Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight
Lucille please come back where you belong
Ive been good to you baby please dont leave me alone
Lucille baby satisfy my heart

I played for it baby and gave you such a wonderful start
