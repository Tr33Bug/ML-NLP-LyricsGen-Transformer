Oh oh oh Miss Ann
Youre doing something no one can
Yeah yeah yeah Miss Ann
Youre doing something no one can
Because believing and deceiving
Its driving me to grieving now
I wanna hear hear hear Miss Ann
I wanna hear her call my name
I wanna hear hear hear Miss Ann
I wanna hear her call my name
Because she cant call it loud
But she calls it so sweet and so plain
Yes I told Miss Ann once
And I told Miss Ann twice
Yes I told Miss Ann once
And I told Miss Ann twice
Boys when Im with Miss Ann
Im living in paradise ow
If she think Im gonna let her be free
How wrong can Miss Ann be
If she think Im gonna let her be free
How wrong can Miss Ann be
Im in love with Miss Ann
And thats the way its going to be
