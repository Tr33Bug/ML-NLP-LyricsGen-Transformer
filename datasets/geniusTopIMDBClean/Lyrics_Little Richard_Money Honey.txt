You know the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long long spell
I went to the window
I peeped through the blind
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind
He said
Money honey ahuhhuh
Money honey
Money honey if you want to get along with me
Well I screamed and I hollered
I was so hardpressed
I called the woman that I loved the best
I finally got my baby about half past three
She said Id like to know what you want with me
I said
Money honey ahuhhuh
Money honey
Money honey if you want to get along with me
Well I said Tell me baby whats wrong with you
From this day on our romance is through
I said Tell me baby face to face
How could another man take my place
She said
Money honey ahuhhuh
Money honey
Money honey if you want to get along with me
Well Ive learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the winds may blow
The women may come and the women may go
But before I say I love you so
I want


Money honey ahuhhuh
Money honey
Money honey if you want to get along with me
