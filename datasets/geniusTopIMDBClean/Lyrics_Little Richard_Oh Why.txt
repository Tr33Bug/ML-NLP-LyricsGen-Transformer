Oh Why? Lyrics
Dreamed I was arrested
Charged with a crime
Forgot to plead innocent
'Cause darling, you're not mine

Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on me
The policeman said maybe
The judge he can agree
The jury keep on guessing
But the DA says it's me

Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on me

The lawyer said plead guilty
And try to cop a plea
But why should I try plead guilty
When you don't belongs to me?

Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on me

The policeman said maybe
The judge he can agree
The jury keep on guessing
But the DA says it's me
You might also like
Oh why?
Why should it happen to me?
Well, I'm fine with it
Have mercy on meEmbed
