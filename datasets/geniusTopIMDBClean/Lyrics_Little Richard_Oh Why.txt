Dreamed I was arrested
Charged with a crime
Forgot to plead innocent
Cause darling youre not mine
Oh why
Why should it happen to me
Well Im fine with it
Have mercy on me
The policeman said maybe
The judge he can agree
The jury keep on guessing
But the DA says its me
Oh why
Why should it happen to me
Well Im fine with it
Have mercy on me
The lawyer said plead guilty
And try to cop a plea
But why should I try plead guilty
When you dont belongs to me
Oh why
Why should it happen to me
Well Im fine with it
Have mercy on me
The policeman said maybe
The judge he can agree
The jury keep on guessing
But the DA says its me


Oh why
Why should it happen to me
Well Im fine with it
Have mercy on me
