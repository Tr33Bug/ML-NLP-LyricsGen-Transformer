Ooh! My Soul Lyrics
Ooh, my soul

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Get up off of that money
Love, love, love, love, love
Ooh, my soul
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Get up off of that money
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Ooh, my soul

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Now don't you know my love for you?
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Get up off of that money
Love, love, love, love, love
Ooh, my soul

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know my love for you?
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Get up off of that money
Love, love, love, love, love
Ooh, my soul

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Get up off of that money
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Ooh, my soul
