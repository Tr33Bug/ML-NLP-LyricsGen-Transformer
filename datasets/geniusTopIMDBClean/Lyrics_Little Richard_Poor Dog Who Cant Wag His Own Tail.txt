Poor Dog  Who Cant Wag His Own Tail  Lyrics
Selfpreservation is the first law of nature
Abide by the rules of the one who made you
The good Lord help those who help themselves
Look out for number one before you help somebody else
Cause its a poor dog
Now its a poor dog
Its a poor dog cant wag his own tail
He cant wag his own tail
Now its a mighty poor captain cant sell his own ship
And its a poor poor actor cant read his own script
Its a poor foundation cant hold up a house
Now its a mighty poor cat cant even catch a mouse
Cause its a poor dog
Its a poor dog
Its a poor dog cant wag his own tail
He cant wag his own tail
Now a chain is no stronger than its weakest link oh yeah
Now a man aint no stronger than he really really thinks
From little acorns a big tree grows
And its a mighty mighty poor rooster that cant even crow
Cause its a poor dog
Its a poor dog
Its a poor dog cant wag his own tail
He cant wag his own tail
Now a poor dog hey yeah yeah yeah
Its a poor dog
Its a poor dog
Woo a poor dog hey
Always tend to somebody elses business
And hes always mindin somebodys business
Listenin and barkin
I can hear him howlin
Hes a poor dog woohoo yeah
