Cruisin on down Main Street
Youre relaxed and feelin good
Next thing that you know youre seein
An octopus in the neighborhood
Surfin on a sound wave
Swingin through the stars
Take a left at your intestine
Take your second right past Mars
On The Magic School Bus
Navigate a nostril
Climb on The Magic School Bus
Spank a plankton too  Take that 
On our Magic School Bus
Raft a river of lava
On The Magic School Bus
Such a fine thing to do
So strap your bones right to the seat
Come on in and dont be shy 
Just to make your day complete
You might get baked into a pie
On The Magic School Bus
Step inside  its a wilder ride
Come on  ride on The Magic School Bus
