Ride on the Magic School Bus LyricsCruisin' on down Main Street
You're relaxed and feelin' good
Next thing that you know you're seein'
An octopus in the neighborhood!
Surfin' on a sound wave
Swingin' through the stars
Take a left at your intestine
Take your second right past Mars.
On The Magic School Bus
Navigate a nostril
Climb on The Magic School Bus
Spank a plankton, too (Take that!)
On our Magic School Bus
Raft a river of lava
On The Magic School Bus
Such a fine thing to do!
So strap your bones right to the seat
Come on in and don't be shy —
Just to make your day complete
You might get baked into a pie
On The Magic School Bus...
Step inside — it's a wilder ride!
Come on — ride on The Magic School Bus!Embed
