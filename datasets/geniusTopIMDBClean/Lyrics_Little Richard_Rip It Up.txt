Rip It Up Lyrics
Well, it's Saturday night and I just got paid
Fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart say "Go go, have a time"
'Cause Saturday night and I'm feel fine

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight
Got me a date and I won't be late
Picked her up in my 88
Shag on down by the union hall
When the joint starts jumping I have a ball

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight

Along about ten I'll be flying high
Rock on out unto the sky
But I don't care if I spend my dough
'Cause tonight, I'm gonna be one happy soul

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight, ow

I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up

Along about ten, I'll be flying high
Rock on out unto the sky
But I don't care if I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonightEmbed
