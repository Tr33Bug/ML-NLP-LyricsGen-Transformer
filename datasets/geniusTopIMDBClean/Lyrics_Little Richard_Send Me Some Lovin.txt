Send me some lovin
Send it I pray
How can I love you
When youre far away
Oh send me your picture
Send it my dear
So I can hold it
Pretend you are here
Can you send me your kisses
I still feel their touch
I need you so badly
I miss you so much
My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
Im here and Im lonely
Im waiting for you
My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
Im here and Im lonely
Im waiting for you
