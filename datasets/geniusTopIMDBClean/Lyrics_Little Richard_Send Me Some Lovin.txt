Send Me Some Lovinâ€™ Lyrics
Send me some lovin'
Send it, I pray
How can I love you
When you're far away?

Oh, send me your picture
Send it, my dear
So I can hold it
Pretend you are here
Can you send me your kisses?
I still feel their touch
I need you so badly
I miss you so much

My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waiting for you


My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waiting for youYou might also likeEmbed
