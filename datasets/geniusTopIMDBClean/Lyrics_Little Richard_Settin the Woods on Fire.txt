Ah come on baby come on
Ow ow ow ow
Comb your hair and paint and powder
You act proud and Ill act prouder
You sing loud and Ill sing louder
Tonight were setting the woods on fire
Hey youre my girl and Im your fella
Dress up in your hot pants of yellow
You look swell but I look sweller
Tonight were setting the woods on fire
Were peeking all the honky tonks
Tonight were having fun
Well show the block a brand new dance
That never has been done
Now I dont care who think that were silly
Youll be dapper and Ill be dilly
Well order up two bowls of chili
Tonight were setting the woods on fire ow ow ow
Ooh were setting the woods on
Ooh were setting the woods on
Ooh were setting the woods on
Tonight were setting the woods on fire
Ooh were setting the woods on
Ooh were setting the woods on
Ooh were setting the woods on
Tonight were setting the woods on fire
Well put aside a little time to fix a flat or two
My tires and tubes are doing fine
But the air is showing through
Oh you clap a hand and Ill start bowing
Well do all the law allowing
Tomorrow well be back down plowing
Tonight were setting the woods on fire
Set it on fire
Oh God we got to set it on fire
Woohoo set it on fire
Hey Lord we got to set it on fire
I gotta gotta set it on fire
Oh baby got to set it on fire
Woo woo we got to set it on fire
