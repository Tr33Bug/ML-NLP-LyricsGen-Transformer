Theres a sweet little girl that lives down the street
Some people think shes square but I think shes sweet
You can see her every day strolling up and down the way
Looking so pretty and this is what I say
Shes got it
Ooh baby shes got it
Ooh baby shes got it
I cant do without her
Big blue eyes long black hair
Dimpled cheeks and shes no square
Shes got it
Ooh baby shes got it
Ooh baby shes got it
I cant do without her
Ruby lips shapely hips
When she walks down the street all the cats flip
Shes got it
Ooh baby shes got it

She loves to sing hot rod queen
Shes real gone in everything
