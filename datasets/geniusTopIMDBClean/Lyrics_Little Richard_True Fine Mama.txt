True, Fine Mama Lyrics
Oh, true fine mama, she's really on the ball
Yes, true fine mama, she's really on the ball
She hears my every plea, comes to my beck and call
Oh, come back, baby, don't leave me here
Whoo, come back, baby, don't leave me here
You know that I love you, don't disappear

Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
You know that I love you, every night and day
Well, singing, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
(Honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey)
(Honey, honey, honey)

Oh, true fine mama, don't go away
Yes, true fine mama, don't go away
You know that I love you, every night and day

Well, I'm singing, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honeyYou might also likeEmbed
