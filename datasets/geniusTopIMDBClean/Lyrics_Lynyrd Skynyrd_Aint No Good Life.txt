Yeah
Aint no good life
Not the one that I lead
Cause the more I fight the sadness yeah
It only seems the more that I grieve
Well I look back on the good times
As some lost part of me
I want to know
Tell me why is it so
Well just cause I dont pray
Lord that dont mean I aint forgiven
Just because Im alive
That dont mean Im making a living
Im gonna get myself together
Im gonna try a dying attempt
Talking bout the good times slipping by
Yeah I tell ya now
I dont even know where last month went
Well I cant make no money baby
Well cause my moneys already spent
And I know where it went
I said it went on that damn rent
Well I I dont mean change baby
I need folding money
Well I want loving
Said I dont need a buddy
But I dont need nobody now woo
Aint exactly my idea
Its sort of old borrowed and blue
Im just trying to say dont try that straight life buddy
Woah youll find it kind of hard on you
Women dont try to cook nothing up ooh
Brother you know youll only wind up in your own stew
Just dont let nobody tell you
Oh what you oughta do
