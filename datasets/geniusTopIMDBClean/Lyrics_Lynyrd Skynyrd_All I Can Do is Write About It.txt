Well this life that Ive lead has took me everywhere
There aint no place I aint never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just aint no place like home
Did you ever see a shegator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee
And Lord I cant make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Do you like to see a mountain stream aflowing
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about well the air your breathing
Well you better listen to my song
And Lord I cant make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Im not trying to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well you can take a boy out of ol Dixieland
But youll never take ol Dixie from a boy
And Lord I cant make any changes
All I can do is write em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Because I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
