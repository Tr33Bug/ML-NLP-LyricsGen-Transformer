All I Can Do is Write About It Lyrics
Well this life that I've lead has took me everywhere
There ain't no place I ain't never gone
But its kind of like the saying that you heard so many times
Well there just ain't no place like home
Did you ever see a she-gator protect her young
Or a fish in a river swimming free
Did you ever see the beauty of the hills of Carolina
Or the sweetness of the grass in Tennessee

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Do you like to see a mountain stream a-flowing
Do you like to see a youngun with his dog
Did you ever stop to think about, well, the air your breathing
Well you better listen to my song

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes

I'm not trying to put down no big cities
But the things they write about us is just a bore
Well you can take a boy out of ol' Dixieland
But you'll never take ol' Dixie from a boy

And Lord I can't make any changes
All I can do is write 'em in a song
I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comes
Because I can see the concrete slowly creeping
Lord take me and mine before that comesYou might also likeEmbed
