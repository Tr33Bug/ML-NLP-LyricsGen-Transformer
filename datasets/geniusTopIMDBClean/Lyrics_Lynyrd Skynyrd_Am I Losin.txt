I recall when I used to come home never had a dime
But Lord I always had a good time
And I recall drinking wine with one of my friends
Lord I cant go back again
Am I losin my own way back home
Am I losin a good friend that Ive known
Am I losin wont you tell me how Ive sinned
Why am I losin one of my best friends
And I recall this friend of mine I knew so well
It goes to show Lord you just cant tell
Now my friend wont talk to me let me tell you why
He thinks Ive changed because of a dollar sign
Am I losin my own way back home
Am I losin a good friend that Ive known
Am I losin wont you tell me how Ive sinned
Why am I losin one of my good friends
And its so strange when you get just a little money
Your socalled friends want to act just a little funny
Yes theyll blame you
But Im not the one thats here to blame
Its you my friend that has really changed
Its a shame such a shame
Am I losin once again
Why these things happen Lord I dont understand
But Lord it can sure hurt a man
Why wont my friend take me as I am
Cause your friend Lord is the most important thing
Am I losin my own way back home
Am I losin a good friend that Ive known
Am I losin wont you tell me how Ive sinned
Why am I losin one of my best friends
Tell me people what good is that
