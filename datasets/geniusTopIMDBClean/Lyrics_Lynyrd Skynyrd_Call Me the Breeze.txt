Call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
I aint got me nobody
I dont carry me no load
Aint no change in the weather
Aint no changes in me
Well there aint no change in the weather
Aint no changes in me
And I aint hidin from nobody
Nobodys hidin from me
Oh thats the way its supposed to be
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin on
Well I got that green light baby
I got to keep movin on
Well I might go out to California
Might go down to Georgia
I dont know
Well I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches
Makes me feel right at home
But I dont love me no one woman
So I cant stay in Georgia long
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
Well now they call me the breeze
I keep blowin down the road
I aint got me nobody
I dont carry me no load
Oooh Mr Breeze
