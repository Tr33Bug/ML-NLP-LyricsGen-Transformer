Cheating woman make you crazy
Cheating woman make you a fool
Shell leave your heart so lonely
Brother theres nothing you can do
Well I cant stand the pain no more
She dont want my love for sure
She dont want poor me
Knocking on her front door
Why did you make me love you sister
When you knew you was untrue
You loved every man with pants on
Yes a dozen for you is too few
Well Im gon get my pistol girl
Im gonna shoot you and end your world
Then you wont bother poor me
Wont bother poor me no longer
Cheating woman  gonna shoot you
Oh woman why you do me
Oh Lord the way you do
I done everything I can baby
Seem like nothing reaches you
Well Im gonna get that pistol gal
Im gonna shoot you and all your pals
You aint gonna bother poor me yeah
You wont bother poor me no longer
