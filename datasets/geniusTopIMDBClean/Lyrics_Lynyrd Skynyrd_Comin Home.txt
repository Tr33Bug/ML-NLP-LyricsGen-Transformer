Its been so long since Ive been gone
Another day might be too long for me
Traveling around Ive had my fill
Of broken dreams and dirty deals
A concrete jungle surrounding me
Many nights Ive slept out in the streets
I paid my dues and I changed my style
Seen hard times
All over now
I want to come home
Its been so long since Ive been away
And please dont blame me cause Ive tried
Ill be coming home soon to your love
To stay
I miss old friends that I once had
Times theyve changed and Ill be glad when I
Go home
I dont know why the thought came to me
But why Im here I really cant see
And now
I want to come home
Its been so long since Ive been away
And please dont blame me cause Ive tried
Ill be coming home soon to your love
To stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love mama
Ive seen better days
I miss old friends that I once had
Times theyve changed and Ill be glad when I
Go home
I dont know why the thought came to me
But why Im here I really cant see
And now
I want to come home
Its been so long since Ive been away
And please dont blame me cause Ive tried
Ill be coming home soon to your love
To stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love mama
Ive seen better days
