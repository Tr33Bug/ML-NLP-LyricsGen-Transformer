Well he walks so tall to be so small
Never met a man whos stranger
He lives his life for a dollar sign
And to deal with him is dangerous
Well he knocked me down but Im on my feet
Now Im so much wiser
Id rather quit and go back home
Than to deal with the money miser
Lets cry for this bad man
I sing a song for the bad man
Well you treat me right baby Ill treat you right
Thats the way its supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me
Well I work seven days a week
Eight when I am able
When you take my money from me you take food from my mamas table
Lets cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man
Oh baby you know who you are
Lets cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man way down in Georgia
Well you treat me right baby Ill treat you right
Thats the way its supposed to be
I put my faith down in my friend
And he almost put an end to me
Well when you take my money baby when you hurt my family
Its like walking through the swamps without no shoes
Step on a snake it scares you
Lets cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man
Lets cry for this bad man
I wrote a song for the bad man
Oh baby straight to you
Hes so bad so bad
