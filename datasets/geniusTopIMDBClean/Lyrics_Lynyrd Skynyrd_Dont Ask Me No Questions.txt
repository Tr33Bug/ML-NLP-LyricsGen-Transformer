Well everytime that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends Ive got just got to come interrogate me
Well I appreciate your feelings and I dont want to pass you by
But I dont ask you about your business dont ask me about mine
Well its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinking the best of whiskey and playing in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road well I just got to have my time
Cause I got to find a break in this action else Im going to lose my mind
So dont ask me no questions
And I wont tell you no lies
So dont ask me about my business
And I wont tell you goodbye thats right
Well Whats your favorite color and Do you dig the Brothers is driving me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep some fool has got to call
Well dont you think that when I come home I just want a little peace of mind
If you want to talk about the business buddy youre just wasting time
So dont ask me no questions
And I wont tell you no lies
So dont ask me about my business
And I wont tell you goodbye
I said dont ask no stupid questions
And I wont send you away
If you want to talk fishing
Well I guess thatll be okay
