Eleven times I been busted eleven times I been to jail
Some of the times I been there nobody could go my bail
Well it seems to me Lord that this ol boy just dont fit
Well I can jump in a rosebush and come out smelling like
Those misters dressed in blue never done so right by me
Some of the times I was innocent but the judge said guilty
Im not one to complain now son I tell you true
When the black cat cross your trail Lord
It comes in misery times two
Double trouble thats what my friends all call me
Double trouble 
I said double trouble
TROUBLE
Well I was born down in the gutter
With a temper as hot as fire
Spent ninety days on a peat farm just doing the countys time
Well now even mama said Son youre bad news
And it wont be too long before someone puts one through you
