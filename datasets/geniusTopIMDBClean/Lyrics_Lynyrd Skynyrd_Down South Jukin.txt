Down South Jukin’ Lyrics
Well, Billy Joe told me ,well everything's looking fine
He got the place all secure, got the icebox full of wine
He said, now hurry on all and don't be late
I got three lovely ladies who just won't wait
We'll do some down south juking, looking for some peace of mind
Now put your Sunday pants, lets get out on the road
We've been working all week and I think its time we let go
We got three fine mamas sitting all alone
Gonna sip our wine, gonna get it on
And do some down south juking, looking for some peace of mind
Well, come Monday morning we'll be headed out to the the field
We'll be doing everything for Papa and old Uncle Bill
Well, come Friday night we'll be headed to town
Trying to pick up any woman hanging around
And do some down south juking, looking for some peace of mind 
And do some down south juking, looking for a peace of mindYou might also likeEmbed
