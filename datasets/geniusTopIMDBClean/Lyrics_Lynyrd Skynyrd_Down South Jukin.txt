Well Billy Joe told me well everythings looking fine
He got the place all secure got the icebox full of wine
He said now hurry on all and dont be late
I got three lovely ladies who just wont wait
Well do some down south juking looking for some peace of mind
Now put your Sunday pants lets get out on the road
Weve been working all week and I think its time we let go
We got three fine mamas sitting all alone
Gonna sip our wine gonna get it on
And do some down south juking looking for some peace of mind
Well come Monday morning well be headed out to the the field
Well be doing everything for Papa and old Uncle Bill
Well come Friday night well be headed to town
Trying to pick up any woman hanging around
And do some down south juking looking for some peace of mind 
And do some down south juking looking for a peace of mind
