Well Ive been riding a winning horse for a long long time
Sometimes I wonder is this the end of the line
No one should take advantage of who they are
No man has got it made
If he thinks he does hes wrong
Every mothers son better hear what I say
Every mothers son will rise and fall someday
Ive seen it happen so many times so many times before
Some mans got so much money he doesnt worry no more
Or hes got such a pretty woman thatll treat him fine
Well my friend has been a fool
It happens everytime
Im not trying to preach to no one to no one at all
Ive seen so many of my good friends just rise to fall
Cause they got so much money or a woman so fine
Well my friends have all been fools it happens every time
What I say
What I say
Oh every mothers son will rise and fall someday
