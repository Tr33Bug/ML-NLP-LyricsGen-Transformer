Floyd was a trapper way back in the holler
Made moonshine so he could make a dollar
Six feet tall dressed in overalls
And wore himself a long gray beard
People say Floyd came to town one day
But two law dogs got in his way
Floyd never hurt no one in his life
But they never came back this way
No they never came back this way
And the people say
Aye aye aye aye hear the hound dogs moan
Aye aye aye aye now that Floyd is long gone
And the creeper was a creeping and the souls they were hollering singing
Aye aye aye aye aye
The Gmen came out to track him down
But the swamp was too deep even one of them drowned
They sent in the hell hounds but they turned around singing
How how how how how
Yeah the souls are they were crying
Yeah the creeper he was creeping
Sheriff Boudreaux came to talk to his neighbors
All they could say is he was eaten by a gator
The legend lives on but Floyd hes at home singing
How how how how how
