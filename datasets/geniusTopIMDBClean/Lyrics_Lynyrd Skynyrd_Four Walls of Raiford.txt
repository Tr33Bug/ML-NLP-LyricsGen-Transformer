Well them four walls of Raiford closing in on me
Doing three to five hard labor for armed robbery
I had two years behind but I could not wait the time
Every time I thought about it well I died some more inside
And I had stripes on my back memories that hurt
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I hit the dirt
Digging ditches for the chain gang sleeping in the cold
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait no more
And I coming home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
Please take mercy on this soldier
From the FloridaGeorgia line
When they find me they must kill me
Oh Jesus save my soul
I cant go back down to Raiford
I cant take that anymore
Well these last few years behind me
Oh Lord have been so sad
I fought proudly for my country when the times were bad
Now they say Im guilty when they find me I must die
Only me and Jesus know that I never stole a dime
Well when Vietnam was over there was no work here for me
I had a pretty wife awaiting and two kids I had to feed
Well Im one of Americas heroes and when they shoot me down
Wont fly old Glory proudly put my medals in the ground
