If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me
For I must be traveling on now
Cause theres too many places Ive got to see
But if I stay here with you girl
Things just couldnt be the same
Cause Im as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh oh oh oh oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I cant change
Bye bye baby its been a sweet love yeah yeah
Though this feeling I cant change
But please dont take it so badly
Cause Lord knows Im to blame
But if I stay here with you girl
Things just couldnt be the same
Cause Im as free as a bird now
And this bird youll never change
Oh oh oh oh oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I cant change
Lord help me I cant change
Lord I cant change
Wont you fly high free bird yeah
