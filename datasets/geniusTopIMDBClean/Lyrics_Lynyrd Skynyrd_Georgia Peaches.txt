Well you can see her walking down on Peach tree Street
She got highheeled shoes and a dot on her cheek
Shes looking good shes headed downtown
Aint got no money honey
She knows her way around
I think shes cute think shes cute as she can be
Talking about a funny talking honktonking Georgia Peach
Well these Georgia Peaches
Son they know their way around
They can take your money son before you get sight of town
Well they talk a little funny but they look so fine
Nine out of ten of them gonna sell you a dime
I think theyre cute think theyre cute as they can be
Talking about a funny talking honktonking Georgia Peach
Well peaches peaches Love them Georgia Peaches

Theyll steal your heart with a Southern smile
Well they talk a little funny but they look so fine
The older they get I swear its like good wine

I just seem to fall in love with the wrong things
