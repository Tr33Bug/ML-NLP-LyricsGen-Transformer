Life is so strange when its changing yes indeed
Well Ive seen the hard times and the pressures been on me
But I keep on working like the working man do
And Ive got my act together going to walk all over you
Gimme back my bullets
Put em back where they belong
Aint fooling around cause I done had my fun
Aint gonna see no more damage done
Gimme back my bullets
Sweet talking people done ran me out of town
And I drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around
But Im leaving this game one step ahead of you
And you will not hear me cry because I do not sing the blues
Been up and down since I turned seventeen
Well Ive been on top and then it seems I lost my dream
But I got it back Im feeling better everyday
Tell all those pencil pushers better get out of my way
