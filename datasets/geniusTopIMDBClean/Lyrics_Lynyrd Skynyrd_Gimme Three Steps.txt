I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for youknowwho
He said Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
What you trying to prove
Cause thats my woman there and Im a man who cares
And this might be all for you
I said Excuse me
I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree
Cause he was lean and mean and
Big and bad Lord apointing that gun at me
Oh wait a minute mister I didnt even kiss her
Dont want no trouble with you
And I know you dont owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you
Oh wont you give me three steps gimme three steps mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister
And youll never seea me no more
For sure
Well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And Im telling you son well it aint no fun
Staring straight down a fortyfour
Well he turned and there screamed at Linda Lou
And thats the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door


Oh wont you give me three steps gimme three steps mister
Gimme three steps towards the door
Gimme three steps gimme three steps mister
And youll never seea me no more
Show me the back door
