Last night I heard this politician
Talking bout his brand new mission
Liked his plans but they came undone when he got around with God and guns
I dont know how he grew up
But it sure wasnt down at the hunting club
Cause if it was hed understand a little bit more about the working man
God and guns
Keep us strong
Thats what this country
Was founded on
Well we might as well give up and run
If we let them take our God and guns
Im here in my back of the woods
Where God is great and guns are good
You really cant know that much about m
If you think were better off without m
Well there was a time we aint forgot
You caressed all night with the doors unlocked
But there aint nobody save no more
So you say your prayers and you thank the lord
For that peace maker
In the Dresser Drawer
Yeaaa
Ooh
God and guns
Dont let m take
Dont you let m take
Dont let m take
Our God and guns
Wohoho
God and guns
Wohohoo
Ooh
