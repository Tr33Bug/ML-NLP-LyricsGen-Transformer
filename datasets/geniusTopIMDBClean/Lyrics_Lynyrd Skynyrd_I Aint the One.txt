Now Ill tell you plainly baby
What I plan to do
Say I may be crazy woman
But I aint no fool
Your daddy is rich mama
Youre overdue
Now I aint the one baby
Been messing with you
Got bells in your mind lady
And its easy to see
I think its time for me to move along
I do believe
Ah youre tryin to put a hook in me baby
Oh no
Now youre talking jive woman
When you say to me
That your daddys gonna take us in baby
Take care of me
You know and I know woman
I aint the one
I never hurt you sweetheart
I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama
And its easy to see
I think its time for me to move along
I do believe
Time for me to put my boots out in the street missy
Are you ready boots walk on
Well now all right there missy let me tell you a thing or two
Now youre talking jive woman
When you say to me
That your daddys gonna take us in baby
Take care of me
When you know and I know woman
I aint the one
I never hurt you sweet heart
I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama
And its easy to see
I think its time for me to move along
I do believe
I must be in the middle of some kind of conspiracy
