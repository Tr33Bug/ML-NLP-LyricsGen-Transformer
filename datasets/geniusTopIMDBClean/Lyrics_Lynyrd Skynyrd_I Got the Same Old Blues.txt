I  Got the  Same Old Blues Lyrics
Have you heard that rumor thats going around
My babys got a man Lord way across town
Its the same old story
Tell me where will it end
Yes I heard the news its the same old blues again
Well I wrote you a letter must have read it wrong
Stood at the doorway baby you was gone
Took a lot of courage
To let the telephone ring
I got the same old blues same old blues again
Well you gave me the business though I didnt mind
Because I got a lot of patience Lord got a lot of time
Its the same old story
Tell me where will it end
I got the same old blues same old blues again
Here come my blues
Wanna find me a mountain and Im going to hide out
Aint talking to you babe Lord I aint coming back
Well I heard that rumor tell where will it end
I got the same old blues same old blues again
I got the blues same old blues
