I (Got the) Same Old Blues Lyrics
Have you heard that rumor that's going around
My baby's got a man, Lord way across town
It's the same old story
Tell me where will it end
Yes I heard the news, it's the same old blues again

Well I wrote you a letter, must have read it wrong
Stood at the doorway, baby you was gone
Took a lot of courage
To let the telephone ring
I got the same old blues, same old blues again

Well you gave me the business, though I didn't mind
Because I got a lot of patience, Lord got a lot of time
It's the same old story
Tell me where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again
Here come my blues

Wanna find me a mountain, and I'm going to hide out
Ain't talking to you babe, Lord I ain't coming back
Well I heard that rumor, tell where will it end
I got the same old blues, same old blues again
