Yes sir
Well the bigger the city well the brighter the lights
The bigger the dog well the harder the bite
I dont know where you been last night
But I think mama you aint doin right
Say I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby I can guess the rest
Well now I dont read that daily news
Cause it aint hard to figure where people get the blues
They cant dig what they cant use
If they stick to themselves theyd be much less abused
Say I know a little
Lord I do know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby I can guess the rest
Play me a little oh yeah
Yeah
Well if you want me to be your only man
Said listen up mama teach you all I can
Do right baby by your man
Dont worry mama teach you all I can
Say I know a little
Lord I know a little about it
I know a little
I know a little about it
I know a little about love
And baby I can guess the rest
Well I know a little about love
Baby I want your best
