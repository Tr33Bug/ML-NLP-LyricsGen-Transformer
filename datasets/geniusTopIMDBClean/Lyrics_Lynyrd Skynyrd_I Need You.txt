Aint no need to worry
There aint no use to cry
Cause Ill be coming home soon
To keep you satisfied
You know I get so lonely
That I feel I cant go on
And it feels so good inside babe
Just to call you on the telephone
And I said
Ooh baby I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need you
I miss you more everyday
I woke up early this morning
And the sun came shining down
And it found me wishin and ahopin
Mama you could be around
Well you know that I need you
More than the air I breathe
And I guess Im just trying to tell you woman
Oh what you mean to me yeah yeah
Ooh baby I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need you
I miss you more everyday
What I say
Im tryin to tell you I love you
In each and every way
Im tryin to tell you I need you
Much more than just a piece of leg
Ooh baby I love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need you
I miss you more every day
Ooh baby I love love love love you
What more can I say
Ooh baby I need your sweet lovin
I miss you more more every day yeah
Ooh baby I love you
Baby I need you
