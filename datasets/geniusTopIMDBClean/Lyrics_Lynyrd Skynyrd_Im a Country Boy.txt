New York City is a thousand miles away
And if you ask me Ill tell you thats okay
Well Im not trying to put the Big Apple down
They dont need a man like me in town
Well I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
I work all day just trying to make a dime
But thats all right thats okay by me
Cause thats the way that it was meant to be
Big city hard times dont bother me
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be
I dont like smoke choking up my air
And some of those city folks well they dont care
I dont like cars buzzing around
I dont even want a piece of concrete in my town
I like sunshine fresh clean air
Makes me feel like you wouldnt care but
Thats all right each to his own
But one smell from the city
And this country boy is gone
I said
Big city hard times dont bother me
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be
Well I dont wanna even read about it
Let me tell you something let me tell you true
Whats right for me might not be right for you
Well you live your way Ill live mine
And I hope that youre happy all the time
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line
I work all day trying to make a dime
But thats all right thats okay by me
Because thats the way that it was supposed to be
Big city hard times never bothered me
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be
Let me tell you I said
Big city hard times never bothered me
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be
Ooh thats my way baby
I dont want you to even tell me about the big city
I dont wanna read about it
