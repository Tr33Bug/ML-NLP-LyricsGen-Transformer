Ive got my pistols in my pockets boys
Im Im Alabama bound
Ive got my pistols in my pocket boys
I Im Alabama bound
Well Im not looking for no trouble
But nobody dogs me around
Now when Im going to fetch my woman people TriCities here I come
Oh and Im going to fetch my woman people TriCities here I come
Cause she was raised up on that cornbread
I know that woman give me some
Give me some baby
Oh when the kid hits Alabama people
Dont you try to dog him around
Now when the kid hits Alabama people
Dont you try to dog him around
Cause if you people cause me trouble Lord
Ive got to put you in the ground
Well I was born in Mississippi
Baby dont take any stuff from you
Oh I was born in Mississippi
And I dont take any stuff from you
And if I hit you on your head
Boy its got to make it black and blue
Ah well Im going to Alabama
Got my pistols out by my side
Cause I ride to Alabama
With my pistols out by my side
Cause down in Alabama
You can run but you sure cant hide
