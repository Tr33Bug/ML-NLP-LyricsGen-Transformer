Mississippi Kid Lyrics
I've got my pistols in my pockets boys
I'm, I'm Alabama bound
I've got my pistols in my pocket boys
I, I'm Alabama bound
Well, I'm not looking for no trouble
But nobody dogs me around

Now when I'm going to fetch my woman, people, Tri-Cities here I come
Oh and I'm going to fetch my woman, people, Tri-Cities here I come
'Cause she was raised up on that cornbread
I know that woman give me some
Give me some baby
Oh when the kid hits Alabama, people
Don't you try to dog him around
Now when the kid hits Alabama, people
Don't you try to dog him around
'Cause if you people cause me trouble, Lord
I've got to put you in the ground


Well, I was born in Mississippi
Baby, don't take any stuff from you
Oh I was born in Mississippi
And I don't take any stuff from you
And if I hit you on your head
Boy, its got to make it black and blue

Ah well I'm going to Alabama
Got my pistols out by my side
'Cause I ride to Alabama
With my pistols out by my side
'Cause down in Alabama
You can run, but you sure can't hideYou might also like1Embed
