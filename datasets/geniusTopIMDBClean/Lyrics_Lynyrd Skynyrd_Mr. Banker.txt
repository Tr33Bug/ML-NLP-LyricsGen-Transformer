Mr Banker Lyrics
Mister Banker
Mister please how much does money mean
Wont you reconsider mister
Wont you do this thing for me
Aint got no house
Aint got no car
All I got Lord is my guitar
But you can have that mister banker
Wont you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please
Listen to how that sound
I would not be here on my knees
But hey mister banker
It means so much to me
Oh wont you reconsider mister
Wont you do this thing for me
I told you mister
I aint got no house
Aint got no car
I got me a 1950 Les Paul guitar
Wont you take it mister banker
Wont you bury my papa for me
Oh mister banker please
