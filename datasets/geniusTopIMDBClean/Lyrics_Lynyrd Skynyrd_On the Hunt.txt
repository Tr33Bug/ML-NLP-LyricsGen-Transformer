I said baby mama I dont know your name
But I said baby sugar I can play your game
Every night when we leave the hall
I see you hanging around
You wanna ride in my big black car baby
Want to go uptown
I know who you are baby
I know what they call you girl
Never put you down baby
Im just like you baby Im on the hunt
I know lady
People going to talk about you and me
Let me say one thing mama sugar I do as I please
And if you wanna love me baby Im your man
And all those highfaluting society people
I dont care if they dont understand
My daddy told me a long time ago
Said theres two things son
Two things you should know
And in these two things you must take pride
Thats a horse and woman yeah
Well both of them you ride
