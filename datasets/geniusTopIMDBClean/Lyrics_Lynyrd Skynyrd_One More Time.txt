How can you stand there smiling
After all youve done
You know it seems to make you happy
When youve hurt someone
Twice before you fooled me
With your deceiving and lying
Come in and close the door one more time
One more time
Yeah youve been gone so long
No one knows where
And you say that you still love me
Then show me you care
Cause you got what it takes sweet mama
To make a man feel fine
So Ill take the word of a liar one more time
One more time
Girl youve got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know Im playing with fire
Get burned every time
Yes Im a fool for you baby I cant deny
But I got to have your sweet love one more time
One more time
Girl youve got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know Im playing with fire
I get burned every time
Yes Im a fool for you mama but I cant deny
But I got to have your sweet love one more time
One more time
Yes Im her fool once more
I can read her brown eyes
But when the rooster crows tomorrow
Well its her turn to cry
Im headed down that old road
She lost her free ride
So tonight Ill take what I paid for one more time
One more time
One more time
