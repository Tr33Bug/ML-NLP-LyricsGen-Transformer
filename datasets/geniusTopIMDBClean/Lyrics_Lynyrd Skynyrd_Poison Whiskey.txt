Daddy was a Cajun baby raised on southern land
And so my kinfolks tell me was a streetfighting man
Well they rushed him down to see the doctor
Well the doctor just checked his head
The only thing that was wrong with him was Johnny Walkers Red
He drank ole poison whiskey
And it killed him dead
Aw yeah
Happened back in the bayou many years ago
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow
Well they rushed him back to see the doctor
Well the doctor just shook his head
Twenty years of rotgut whiskey done killed this poor man dead
He drank ole poison whiskey
Till it killed him dead
You people hear what I said
Sweet guitar
Oh poison whiskey
Take a tip from me people
Brothers cant you see
Aint no future in ole poison whiskey
Theyre gonna rush you down to see that doctor
Well the doctors gonna shake his head
The only thing hes gonna tell you baby
Stop drinking Johnny Walkers Red
Dont drink poison whiskey dont you drink it boy
