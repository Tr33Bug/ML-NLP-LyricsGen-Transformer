We dont have no plastic LA friends
We arent on the edge of no popular trends
Have never seen the inside of that magazine GQ
We dont care if your a lawyer or a Texas oil man
Or some waitress busting ass at some liquor stand
But if you got soul we hang out with people just like you
And my hairs turning white my necks always been red my collars still blue
Weve always been here just trying to sing the truth to you
Guess you could say weve always been red white and blue
We ride our own bikes to Sturgis
Pay our own dues
Smoking Camels and drinking domestic brews
If you want to know where Ive been just look at my hands
Yeah Ive driven by the White House spent some time in jail
Mama cried all night but she still wouldnt pay my bail
I have been no angel but even God he understands
Well my Daddy worked hard and so have I
We payed our taxes and gave our lives to serve this great country
So what are they complaining about
Yeah we love our families we love our kids
Dont you know its love that makes us all so rich
Thats where its at if they dont like it they can just get the Hell out
