Two feets they come a creepin
Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin naked
A creeper think he got nothin to lose
So he creeps into this house yeah
And unlocks the door
An as the mans reaching for his trousers
He shoots him full of 38 holes
Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel thats blue and cold
It aint good for nothing but puttin men six feet in a hole
Big Jims been drinking whiskey
And playing poker on a losing night
An pretty soon Ol Jim starts athinkin
Somebody been cheatin and lyin
So Big Jim commence to fighting
I wouldnt tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes
Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel thats blue and cold
It aint good for nothing but puttin men six feet in a hole
Hmm and thats the Saturday Night Special
For twenty dollars you can buy yourself one too
Here it come


Oh lemme tell you all about it
Hand guns are made for killing
They aint no good for nothing else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself
So why dont we dump em people to the bottom of the sea
Before some old fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you or me
Mister Saturday Night Special
You got a barrel thats blue and cold
You aint good for nothing but puttin men six feet in a hole
Its a Saturday Night Special
And Id like to tell you what you can do with it too
And thats the end of this song
