I asked the wiseman one sunny day
Can you help me find my way
Youre so much older and wiser too
Would you help me mr wiseman
Im feeling blue
Oh Im not satisfied
He said youre not doing too bad no not bad at all
Youre just trying to walk son before you can crawl
You got stacks of money to the sky up above
Now all you need is to find you a love
He sent me searching to find my love
He sent me searching to the Lord up above
He sent me searching just to find the morning dove
And shell tell you where to find your love
Oh mr wiseman I need to find my love
You can have anything in this gods world
But you wont be happy son til you find a girl
Now you can be happy boy if you try
Find a woman son and youll be satisfied
Oh Lord he sent me searching
