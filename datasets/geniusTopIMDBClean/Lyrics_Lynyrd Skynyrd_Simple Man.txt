Mama told me when I was young
Come sit beside me my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this itll help you some sunny day ah yeah
Be a simple man 
Oh take your time dont live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
Youll find a woman yeah and youll find love
And dont forget son there is someone up above
And be a simple kind of man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh wont you do this for me son if you can
Forget your lust for the rich mans gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this oh baby if you try
All that I want for you my son is to be satisfied
And be a simple kind of man
