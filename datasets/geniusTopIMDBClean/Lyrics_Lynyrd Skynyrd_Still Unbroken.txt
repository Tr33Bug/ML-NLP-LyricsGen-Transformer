Broken bones broken hearts
Stripped down and torn apart
A little bit of rust  Im still running
Counting miles counting tears
Twisted roads shifting gears
Year after year  its all or nothing
But Im not home Im not lost
Still holding on to what I got
Aint much left
No theres so much thats been stolen
I guess Ive lost everything Ive had
But Im not dead at least not yet
Still alone still alive Still UNBROKEN
Im still alone still alive
IM STILL UNBROKEN
Never captured never tamed
Wild horses on the plains
You can call me lost  I call it FREEDOM
I feel the spirit in my soul
Its something Lord I cant control
IM NEVER GIVING UP WHILE IM STILL BREATHING
Like the wind like the rain
Its all running through my veins
Like a river pouring down into the ocean
Im out here on the streets
But Im standing on my feet
Still alive still alone still unbroken
Im still alone
Still alive
Still unbroken
Im still unbroken
I aint never going down
Im still unbroken
Oohooh
