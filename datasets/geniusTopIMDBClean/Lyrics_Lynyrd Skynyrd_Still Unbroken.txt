Still Unbroken Lyrics
Broken bones, broken hearts
Stripped down and torn apart
A little bit of rust - I'm still running
Counting miles, counting tears
Twisted roads, shifting gears
Year after year - it's all or nothing

But I'm not home, I'm not lost
Still holding on to what I got
Ain't much left
No there's so much that's been stolen
I guess I've lost everything I've had
But I'm not dead, at least not yet
Still alone, still alive, Still UNBROKEN
I'm still alone, still alive
I'M STILL UNBROKEN
Never captured, never tamed
Wild horses on the plains
You can call me lost - I call it FREEDOM
I feel the spirit in my soul
It's something Lord I can't control
I'M NEVER GIVING UP WHILE I'M STILL BREATHING


Like the wind, like the rain
It's all running through my veins
Like a river pouring down into the ocean
I'm out here on the streets
But I'm standing on my feet
Still alive, still alone, still unbroken


I'm still alone
Still alive
Still unbroken
I'm still unbroken
I ain't never going down
I'm still unbroken
