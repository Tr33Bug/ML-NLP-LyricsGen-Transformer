Im going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a coon
Well Im going down to the swamp
Going to watch me a hound dog catch a coon
You know the hound dog makea music
On a summer night under a full moon
Lord fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
Lord fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
And when the hound dog start barking
Sounds like ol Son House singing the blues
Hound dog sing that
Swamp swamp swamp swamp music
Swamp swamp swamp swamp music
When the hound dog starts singing
I aint got them big ol city blues
Well hey pretty mama
Lord just take that city hike
Said go ahead pretty mama
Lord just take your city hike
Well Id rather live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life
Singing that
Swamp swamp swamp swamp music
Swamp swamp swamp swamp music
Well Id rather live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life
Well Id wanna live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life
