One two three
Turn it up
Big wheels keep on turnin
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think its a sin yes
Well I heard Mr Young sing about her  Southern man 
Well I heard ol Neil put her down
Well I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man dont need him around anyhow
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord Im coming home to you
In Birmingham they love the governor  Boo Boo Boo 
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you
Tell the truth
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord Im coming home to you
Here I come Alabama
Ahahah Alabama
Ahahah Alabama
Ahahah Alabama
Ahahah Alabama 
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And theyve been known to pick a song or two  Yes they do 
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when Im feeling blue
Now how bout you
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord Im coming home to you
Sweet home Alabama  Oh sweet home baby 
Where the skies are so blue  And the governors true 
Sweet home Alabama  Lordy 
Lord Im coming home to you  Yeah yeah 
Mont Montgomerys got the answer
