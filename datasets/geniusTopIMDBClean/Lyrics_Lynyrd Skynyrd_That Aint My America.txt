Sometimes I wanna light up underneath the nosmoking sign
Sometimes I wish theyd tell me how justice got so blind
I wish theyd just leave me alone cause Im doing alright
You can take your change on down the road and leave me here with mine
Cause that aint my America
That aint this countrys roots
You wanna slam old Uncle Sam
But I aint letting you
Im mad as hell and you know I still bleed Red White and Blue
That aint us
That Aint My America
I was standing there in Dallas
Waiting on a plane
I overheard an old man
Tell a young soldier thanks
The young soldier hung his head and said its hard to believe
Youre the only one who took the time to say a word to me
And the old man said
Its to the women and men who in their hands hold a Bible and a gun
And they aint afraid of nothing when when theyre holding either one
Now theres kids who cant pray in school
100 dollar tanks of gas
I can tell you right now this country aint
AINT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT
NO
