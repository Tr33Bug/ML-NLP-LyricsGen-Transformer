Let me tell you
Where I come from its grits and gravy not champagne and caviar
Got pickup trucks there is no mercedes thats who we are  Oooooh Yeah I wouldnt change a thing 
I am no saint sometimes a sinner and I cant tell you why
But I get up every morning and thank the man above  Oooooh WOOOoo my life is good 
Let me tell ya how good hahaaa
Like my women hot and my beer ice cold
A real fast car and my whiskey old
Like a slow drive down and old dirt road
Thats How I like it
I like to turn my music way up loud
There is nothing better than the sound of a crowd
American flag it makes me proud
Thats how I like it
Woooooaaah Listen now
There is no cell phone towers you wont catch me online
Working with my hands for hours is how I spend my time
And I dont stand in line for coffee It is not my cup of tea
Out here in the country we got everything we need Ooooh Woooo yeah
Ooooohhhh
WOOooooo Thats how I like it
WOOOOOoooo
Yeah
