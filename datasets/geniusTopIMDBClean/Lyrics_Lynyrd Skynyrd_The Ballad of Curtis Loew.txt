Well I used to wake the mornin
Before the rooster crowed
Searchin for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash em in and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew
Old Curt was a black man
With white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro
Used to play it cross his knee
Id give old Curt my money
Hed play all day for me
Play me a song
Curtis Loew Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But Id go see him again
Id clap my hands stomp my feets
Try to stay in time
Hed play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine
Play me a song
Curtis Loew Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
Yes sir
On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol preacher said some words
And they chucked him in the clay
Well he lived a lifetime
Playin the black mans blues
And on the day he lost his life
Thats all he had to lose
Play me a song
Curtis Loew hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here
So everyone would know
People said he was useless
Them people all are fools
Cause Curtis youre the finest picker
To ever play the blues
