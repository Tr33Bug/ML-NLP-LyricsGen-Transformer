Theres a grey horse standing still
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
The rain pours off his hat
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes
Now the cannons are silent
His friends are all gone gotta put it all behind him
If he ever wants to find his way home
Hes the last rebel on the road
Just a boy with his old guitar
Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong
But he carried on got a dream that will never die
Cant change him
No use in staying where you dont belong
Now hes rolling down the highway
Gone too far too fast
No one will ever find him
Hell never look back
Because hes the last rebel
And hes all alone Hes the last rebel
His friends are all gone
Hes the last rebel the last rebel on the road
Therell never be another like him
Hes the last of a dying breed
Aint no use trying to change him
Because hes the last rebel
And hes all alone Hes the last rebel
His friends are all gone
Hes the last rebel the last rebel on the road
