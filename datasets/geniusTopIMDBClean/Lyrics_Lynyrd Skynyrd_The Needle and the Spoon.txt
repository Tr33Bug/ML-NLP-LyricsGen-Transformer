Thirty days Lord and thirty nights
Im coming home on an airplane flight
Mama waiting at the ticket line
Tell me son why do you stand there crying
It was the needle and the spoon
And a trip to the moon
Took me away took me away
Ive been feeling so sick inside
Got to get better lord before I die
Seven doctors couldnt help my head they said
You better quit son before youre dead
Quit the needle quit the spoon
Quit the trip to the moon
Were going to take you away Lord we going to take you away
It was the needle and the spoon
Ive seen a lot of people who thought they were cool
But then again Lord Ive seen a lot of fools
Well I hope you people Lord can hear what I say
Youll have your chance to hit it some day
Dont mess with the needle or a spoon
Or any trip to the moon
Itll take you away
Lord they gonna bury you boy
Dont mess with the needle
Now I know I know I know I know I know
