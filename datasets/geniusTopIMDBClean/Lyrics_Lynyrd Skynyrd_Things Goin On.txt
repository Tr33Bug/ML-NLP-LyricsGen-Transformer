Well have you ever lived down in the ghetto
Have you ever felt that cold wind blow
Well if you dont know what I mean
Wont you stand up and scream
Because theres things going on that you dont know
Too many lives theyve spent across the ocean
Too much money been spent upon the moon
Well until they make it right
I hope they never sleep at night
They better make some changes and do it soon
Do it now do it to it
Well theyre going ruin the air that we breathe
Lord have mercy
Theyre gonna ruin us all by and by
Im telling all you beware
I dont think they really care
I think they just sit up there
And just get high
Have you ever lived down in that ghetto
And have you ever felt that cold wind blow
Well if you dont know what I mean
Wont you stand up and scream
Cause theres things going on that you dont know
Well if you dont know what I mean
Wont you stand up and scream
Cause theres things going on that you dont know
Tell it
Tell it tell it
Things going on
