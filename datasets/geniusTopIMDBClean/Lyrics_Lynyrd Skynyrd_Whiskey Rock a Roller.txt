Im headed down a highway got my suitcase by my side
Blue skies hanging over my head I got 500 miles to ride
Im going down to Memphis town to play a late night show
I hope the people are ready there cause the boys are all ready to go
Well Im a whiskey rock a roller
Thats what I am
Women whiskey and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
I was born a travellin man and my feets do burn the ground
I dont care for fancy music if the shoes cant shuffle around
I got a hundred women or more and theres no place I call home
The only time Im satisfied is when Im on the road Lord
Well Im a whiskey rock a roller
Thats what I am
Women whiskey and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
Sometimes I wonder where we go
Lord dont you take my whiskey and rock n roll
Take me down to Memphis town bus driver get me there
I got me a queenie she got long brown curly hair
She likes to drink Old Grandad and her shoes do shuffle around
And every time I see that gal
Lord she wants to take me down
Well Im a whiskey rock a roller
Thats what I am
Women whiskey and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
Sometimes I wonder where will we go
Lord dont you take my whiskey and rock n roll
