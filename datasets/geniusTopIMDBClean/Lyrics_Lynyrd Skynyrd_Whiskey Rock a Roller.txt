Whiskey Rock a Roller Lyrics
I'm headed down a highway, got my suitcase by my side
Blue skies hanging over my head, I got 500 miles to ride
I'm going down to Memphis town, to play a late night show
I hope the people are ready there, 'cause the boys are all ready to go

Well, I'm a whiskey rock a' roller
That's what I am
Women, whiskey, and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
I was born a travellin' man and my feets do burn the ground
I don't care for fancy music, if the shoes can't shuffle around
I got a hundred women or more and there's no place I call home
The only time I'm satisfied, is when I'm on the road, Lord

Well, I'm a whiskey rock a' roller
That's what I am
Women, whiskey, and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
Sometimes I wonder, where we go
Lord don't you take my whiskey; and rock n roll


Take me down to Memphis town, bus driver get me there
I got me a queenie, she got long, brown, curly hair
She likes to drink Old Grandad and her shoes do shuffle around
And every time I see that gal
Lord she wants to take me down

Well, I'm a whiskey rock a' roller
That's what I am
Women, whiskey, and miles of traveling
Is all I understand
Sometimes I wonder, where will we go
Lord don't you take my whiskey; and rock n rollYou might also likeEmbed
