Seven years of hard luck coming down on me
From the Florida border yes up to Nashville Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name mister every honky tonk
Along come Mr Yankee Slicker saying maybe youre what I want
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin For MCA
9000 dollars thats all we could win
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol Southern grin
Theyre gonna take me out to California gonna make me a superstar
Just pay me all my money mister maybe you wont get a scar
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin For MCA
Oh suckers took my money since I was seventeen
If it aint no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But Ill sign my contract baby and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make Im gonna see where my money goes
Want you to sign your contract
Want you to sign today
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin For MCA
