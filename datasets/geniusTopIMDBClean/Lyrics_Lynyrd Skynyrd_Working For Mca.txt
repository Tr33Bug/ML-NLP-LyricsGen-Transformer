Working For Mca LyricsSeven years of hard luck comin' down on me
From a motor boat, yes, up in Nashville, Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name, yes, every honky tonk
They all come to see Yankee slicker saying, baby, you're what I want
Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA
Oh, nine thousand dollars just to sow to the wind
Come to smile at the Yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
They're gonna take me out to California, gonna make me a super star
Just pay me all my money, mister, maybe you won't get a star
Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin' for MCA

Slickers steal my money since I was seventeen
If it ain't no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I signed my contract, baby, and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make, I gotta see where my money goes
Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
