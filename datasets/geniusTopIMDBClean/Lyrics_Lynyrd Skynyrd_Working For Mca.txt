Seven years of hard luck comin down on me
From a motor boat yes up in Nashville Tennessee
I worked in every joint you can name yes every honky tonk
They all come to see Yankee slicker saying baby youre what I want
Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin for MCA
Oh nine thousand dollars just to sow to the wind
Come to smile at the Yankee slicker with a big old southern grin
Theyre gonna take me out to California gonna make me a super star
Just pay me all my money mister maybe you wont get a star
Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin for MCA
Slickers steal my money since I was seventeen
If it aint no pencil pusher then it got to be a honky tonk queen
But I signed my contract baby and I want you people to know
That every penny that I make I gotta see where my money goes
Want you to sign the contract
Want you to sign the date
Gonna give you lots of money
Workin for MCA
