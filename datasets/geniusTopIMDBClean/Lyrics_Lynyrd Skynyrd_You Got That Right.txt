Well Ive heard lots of people say
Theyre gonna settle down
You dont see their faces
And they dont come around
Well Im not that way
I got to move along
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said you got that right
Sure got that right
Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and Im always alone
Guess I was born with a travelin bone
When my times up Ill hold my own
You wont find me in an old folks home
You got that right
Said you got that right
Well you got that right
Sure got that right
I tried everything in my life  Uhhuh 
Things I like I try em twice
You got that right
You sure got that right
Traveling around the world just singing my song
I got to go Lord I cant stay long
Here comes that ol traveling jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said you got that right
Well you got that right
Sure got that right
