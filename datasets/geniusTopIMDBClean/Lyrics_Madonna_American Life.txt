Do I have to change my name
Will it get me far
Should I lose some weight
Am I gonna be a star
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
Its why I wrote this song
This type of modern life is it for me
This type of modern life is it for free
So I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
Its more easily said
Its always been the same
This type of modern life is not for me
This type of modern life is not for free
American life  American life 
I live the American Dream  American Dream 
You are the best thing Ive seen
You are not just a dream  American life 
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life is it for me
This type of modern life is it for free
Do I have to change my name
Will it get me far
Should I lose some weight
Am I gonna be a star
American life  American life 
I live the American Dream  American Dream 
You are the best thing Ive seen
You are not just a dream  American life 
I tried to be a boy
Tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess
Tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend
Tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
Fuck it
Do I have to change my name
Will it get me far
Should I lose some weight
Am I gonna be a star
Ah fuck it
Ah fuck it
A fuck it
A fuck it
Im drinking a soy latte I get a double shot
It goes right through my body and you know Im satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper and Im feeling superduper
Yo they tell Im a trooper and you know Im satisfied
I do yoga and pilates and the room is full of hotties
So Im checking out the bodies and you know Im satisfied
Im digging on the isotopes this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope you know Im satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager an agent and a chef
Three nannies an assistant and a driver and a jet
A trainer and a butler and a bodyguard or five
A gardener and a stylist do you think Im satisfied
Id like to express my extreme point of view
Im not a Christian and Im not a Jew
Im just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems
Do I have to change my name  American life 
Am I gonna be a star  I live the American Dream 
Do I have to change my name  American life 
Am I gonna be a star  I live the American Dream 
Do I have to change my name
American life I live the American Dream 
American life I live the American Dream 
American life I live the American Dream 
American life
