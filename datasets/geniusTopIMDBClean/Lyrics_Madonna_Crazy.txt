I spent all night waitin up
Its gon be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that Im just way too much
You got your hands full I misunderstood
Now I see that Im who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong youre tryna make good
But if you think Ive been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess its shame on you
Said now if you think Ive been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby Ima switch the plans on you
Cause youre driving me crazy
You must think Im crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I wont let you drive me crazy
I wont let you drive me crazy
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca
I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God look at me now
Peel off my weakness layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep round
Im a force and I wont tame babe
Cant go through this and stay the same babe
Ive seen a lot of stranger things babe
And Ill never look at you the same
But if you think Ive been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess its shame on you
Said now if you think Ive been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby Ima switch the plans on you
Cause youre driving me crazy
You must think Im crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I wont let you drive me crazy
I wont let you drive me crazy
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Eu te amo
Mas no deixo voc me destruir
I put you on a pedestal but statues they can fall
Felt so safe I let you drive me straight into the wall
Played the hand you dealt me thought you felt me
Was never good at games now Ill just forget your name
Forget your name  Mmm
But if you think Ive been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess its shame on you
Said now if you think Ive been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby Ima switch the plans on you
Cause youre driving me crazy
You must think Im crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I wont let you drive me crazy
I wont let you drive me crazy  Crazy 
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca  Louca 
Cause youre driving me crazy
You must think Im crazy
Voc me pe to louca
Voc pensa que eu sou louca
And I wont let you drive me crazy
I wont let you drive me crazy
Voc no vai me pr to louca
Voc no vai me pr to louca
