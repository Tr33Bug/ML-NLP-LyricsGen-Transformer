Its a beautiful life but Im not concerned
Its a beautiful dream but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words cause Im not concerned
Cause your world is such a shame
Cause your worlds obsessed with fame
Cause your worlds in so much pain
Cause your world is cause your world is
Up in flames
Its a beautiful plan  Hmm  but Im not concerned  Oh yeah 
Its a beautiful game  Hmm  that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth  Shut your mouth  that I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies  Hmm  cause Im not concerned
Cause your world is such a shame
Cause your worlds obsessed with fame
Cause your worlds in so much pain
Cause your world is cause your world is
I will not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And Im not afraid at all to die cause I believe Him
God is on my side and Ill be His bride
I am not afraid cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that Im a witch and burn me at the stake
Its all a big mistake
Dont you know to doubt Him is a sin
I wont give in
They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know but we are just not ready to act
The storm isnt in the air its inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But its getting late now
Cant you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind thats beginning to howl


Its a beautiful life
