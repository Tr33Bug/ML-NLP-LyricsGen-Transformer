Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
I cant help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Thats what my mama told me
Round and round and round you go
When you find love youll always know
I let my father mold me
Daddy couldnt be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away Im gonna be there 
And my mama made me learn this song
Youre gonna bring your love to me Im gonna get you 
Thats why
I cant help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go
All is fair in love she said
Think with your heart not with your head
Thats what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me
Daddy couldnt be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away Im gonna be there 
And my mama made me learn this song
Youre gonna bring your love to me Im gonna get you 
Thats why
I cant help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
I cant help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I cant explain
But my love is alive
And Im never gonna hide it again
Daddy couldnt be all wrong
Not gonna let you slip away Im gonna be there 
And my mama made me learn this song
Youre gonna bring your love to me Im gonna get you 
Thats why
I cant help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Youve got to just let your body move to the music
Youve got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love falling in love falling in love
I cant keep from falling in love with you
You know theres nothing better that Id like to do
