TranslationsPortuguêsDevil Pray Lyrics
Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away
I've been swimming in the ocean
'Til I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way home
Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we could travel together
And make the devil pray

(Ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—)
Devil's here to fool ya
(Ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—)
Devil's here to fool ya
Ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—
Devil's here to fool ya
Ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—, ooh, save my, s—
Devil's here to fool ya

Mother Mary, can't you help me?
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

Forever be lost, with no way home

Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we could travel together
And make the devil pray

Ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told
I said ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

I said (Ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah)
(Ooh, save my soul) Sing hallelujah
(Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya)
Until my story's told21Embed
