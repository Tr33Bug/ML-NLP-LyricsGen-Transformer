Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
Ive been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away
Ive been swimming in the ocean
Til Im almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray
And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home
Yeah we can run and we can hide but we wont find the answers
If you go down then youll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul then we could travel together
And make the devil pray
Ooh save my s ooh save my s ooh save my s 
Devils here to fool ya
Ooh save my s ooh save my s ooh save my s 
Devils here to fool ya
Ooh save my s ooh save my s ooh save my s
Devils here to fool ya
Ooh save my s ooh save my s ooh save my s
Devils here to fool ya
Mother Mary cant you help me
Cause Ive gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away
The ground beneath my feets getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on but Im getting weaker
Watch me disappear


And we can do drugs and we can smoke weed and we can drink whiskey
Yeah we can get high and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue and we can do E and we can drop acid
Forever be lost with no way home
Yeah we can run and we can hide but we wont find the answers
If you go down then youll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul then we could travel together
And make the devil pray
Ooh ooh sing hallelujah
Ooh save my soul
Ooh ooh the devils here to fool ya
Until my storys told
I said ooh ooh sing hallelujah
Ooh save my soul
Ooh ooh the devils here to fool ya
Until my storys told
I said  Ooh ooh sing hallelujah 
Ooh save my soul  Sing hallelujah
Ooh ooh the devils here to fool ya 
Until my storys told
