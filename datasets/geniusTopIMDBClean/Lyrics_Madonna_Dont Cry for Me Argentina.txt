It wont be easy youll think its strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that Ive done
You wont believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although shes dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen I had to change
Couldnt stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Dont cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Dont keep your distance
And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
Theyre not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Dont cry for me Argentina
Dont cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Dont keep your distance
Have I said too much
Theres nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true
