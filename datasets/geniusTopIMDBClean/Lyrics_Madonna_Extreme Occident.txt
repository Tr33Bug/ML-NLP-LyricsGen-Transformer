I went to the far right
Then I went to the far left
I tried to recover my center of gravity
I guess Im lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasnt lost
I came from the Midwest
Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover my own identity
I guess Im lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasnt lost
I wasnt lost
No I wasnt lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity and craziness
But I wasnt lost you believe me
I was right and Ive got the right
To choose my own life like a full circle
Life is a circle life is a circle life is a circle life is a circle
Life is a circle life is a circle life is a circle life is a circle
Aquilo que mais magoa
que eu no estava perdida
Aquilo que mais magoa
que eu no estava perdida


I guess Im lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasnt lost
I wasnt lost
