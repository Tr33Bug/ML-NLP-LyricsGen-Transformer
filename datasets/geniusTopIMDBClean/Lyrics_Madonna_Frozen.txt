You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
Youre frozen when your hearts not open
Youre so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
Youre broken when your hearts not open
Mmmmmm if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm wed never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key
Now theres no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you my heart will be broken
Love is a bird she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
Youre frozen when your hearts not open
Mmmmmm if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm wed never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
Youre frozen when your hearts not open
Mmmmmm if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm wed never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm wed never be apart
Mmmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmmm you hold the key


If I could melt your heart
