Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everythings bound to break
Sooner or later sooner or later
Youre all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But were gonna stay here were gonna stay here
Ahahah ahahah
I know youre scared tonight
Ahahah ahahah
Ill never leave your side
When it all falls when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold Ill be your cover
Lets just hold onto each other
When it all falls when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town
Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everythings gone to hell
We gotta stay strong were gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All weve got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song something to build on
Ahahah ahahah
I know youre scared tonight
Ahahah ahahah
Ill never leave your side
When it all falls when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold Ill be your cover
Lets just hold onto each other
When it all falls when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town
I know were alright cause well never be alone
In this mad mad in this mad mad world
Even with no light were gonna shine like gold
In this mad mad in this mad mad world
When it all falls when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town
When it all falls when it all falls down
Ill be your fire when the lights go out
When theres no one no one else around
Well be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold Ill be your cover
Lets just hold onto each other
When it all falls when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town
When it all falls when it all falls down
Well be two souls in a ghost town
