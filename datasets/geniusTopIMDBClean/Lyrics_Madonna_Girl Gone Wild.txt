Oh my God  God 
I am heartly sorry for having offended thee
And I detest all my sins
Because I dread the loss of Heaven  Heaven 
And the pain of Hell  Hell 
But most of all because I love thee  Thee 
And I want so badly to be good  Good good good good good 
Its so hypnotic  Hypnotic 
The way he pulls on me
Its like the force of gravity
Right up under my feet
Its so erotic  Erotic 
This feeling cant be beat
Its coursing through my whole body
Feel the heat
I got that burnin hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
Its coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
Its got me singing
Heyeyeyeyeyey
Like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Im like heyeyeyeyeyey
Like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Im like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
The room is spinning  Spinning 
It must be the Tanqueray
Im about to go astray
My inhibitions gone away
I feel like sinning  Sinning 
You got me in the zone
DJ play my favorite song
Turn me on
I got that burnin hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
Its coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
Its got me singing
Heyeyeyeyeyey
Like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Im like heyeyeyeyeyey
Like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun
I know I know I know I shouldnt act this way
I know I know I know good girls dont misbehave
Misbehave
But Im a bad girl anyway hey
Forgive me
Heyeyeyeyeyey
Like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Im like heyeyeyeyeyey
Like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin gun
On the floor til the daylight comes
Girls they just wanna have some fun
Im like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
Im like a girl gone wild a good girl gone wild
