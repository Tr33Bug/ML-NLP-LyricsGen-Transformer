Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied we lost respect
When we wake up what can we do
Get the kids ready take them to school
Everybody knows they dont have a chance
To get a decent job to have a normal life
When they talk reforms it makes me laugh
They pretend to help it makes me laugh
I think I understand why people get a gun
I think I understand why we all give up
Every day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocence spread everywhere
They say that we need love
But we need more than this
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
This is your wakeup call
Im like your nightmare
Im here to start your day
This is your wakeup call
We dont have to fall
A new democracy
God and pornography
A new democracy
People think that Im insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth it gives me hope
Thats why I dont smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I dont smoke its true
