You wouldnt let me say the words I longed to say
You didnt want to see life through my eyes
Express yourself dont repress yourself 
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silence me with bitterness and lies
Express yourself dont repress yourself 
Did I say something wrong
Oops I didnt know I couldnt talk about sex
I mustve been crazy 
Did I stay too long
Oops I didnt know I couldnt speak my mind
What was I thinking 
And Im not sorry  Im not sorry

And Im not sorry  Im not sorry 
Im not your bitch dont hang your shit on me  Its human nature 
You punished me for telling you my fantasies
Im breaking all the rules I didnt make
Express yourself dont repress yourself 
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
Express yourself dont repress yourself 
Did I say something true
Oops I didnt know I couldnt talk about sex
I mustve been crazy 
Did I have a point of view
Oops I didnt know I couldnt talk about you
What was I thinking 
And Im not sorry  Im not sorry 
Its human nature  Its human nature 
And Im not sorry  Im not sorry 
Im not your bitch dont hang your shit on me  Its human nature
