Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Every little thing that you say or do
Im hung up Im hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day
Im fed up Im tired of waiting on you
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
Im caught up I dont know what to do
Time goes by so slowly

Time goes by so slowly
I dont know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do
Im hung up Im hung up on you
Waiting for your call baby night and day

Ring ring ring goes the telephone
The lights are on but theres no one home
Tick tick tock its a quarter to two
And Im done Im hanging up on you


I cant keep on waiting for you
I know that youre still hesitating
Dont cry for me cause Ill find my way
Youll wake up one day but itll be too late
Every little thing that you say or do

Waiting for your call baby night and day
