Wake up exwife
This is your life
Children on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages manager
No time for a manicure
Working out shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the WiFi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I dont even feel the pressure
Im gonna be okay
I dont care what the people say
Im gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and Im gonna live right
Im moving fast can you follow my track
Im moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem I dont give a
You were so mad at me
Whos got custody
Lawyers suck it up
Didnt have a prenup
Make a film write a song
Gotta get my stockings on
Meet the press buy the dress
All of this to impress
RIde my horse break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row


Im gonna be okay
I dont care what the people say
Im gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and Im gonna live right
Im moving fast can you follow my track
Im moving fast and I like it like that
I do ten things all at once
And if you have a problem I dont give a
I tried to be a good girl
I tried to be your wife
Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me
And if it was a failure I dont give a
I dont give a III dont
I dont give a III dont
I dont give a III dont
I dont give a
