Im the best the world has ever seen  Im the best ever 
Im somebody youll never forget cause I work hard and sweat in my tears  Cant be stopped 
Im never falling again and if I did Id come back
If you try and fail get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you dont make the choice and you dont use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead
What you want is just within your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears to overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

Alright
Firefly change when they catch ya
Wanna put ya in their net for their light glow
Yellow brick highway
Paparazzi piled up on the high road
They just turned the sun into an idol
They just wanna see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall back
Madonna said I remind her of Michael
Steady blowing up my head blowing up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book put me in the laws
Put me in the desk and in the Synagogue
Firefly glow when they catch ya
Wanna catch ya when ya lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen
You an icon
