I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train crosscountry
You put this in me
So now what so now what
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping praying
For you to justify my love
I want to know you
Not like that
I dont want to be your mother
I dont want to be your sister either
I just want to be your lover
I want to have you baby
Kiss me thats right kiss me
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning burning
For you to justify my love
What are you going to do
What are you going to do
Talk to me tell me your dreams
Am I in them
Tell me your fears
Are you scared
Tell me your stories
Im not afraid of who you are
We can fly
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me thats right love me
I want to be your baby
