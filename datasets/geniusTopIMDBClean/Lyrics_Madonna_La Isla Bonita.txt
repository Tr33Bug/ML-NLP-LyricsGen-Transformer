Cmo puede ser verdad
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like Id never gone I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday not far away
Tropical the island breeze all of nature wild and free
Ahah ahah ahah 
This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played the sun would set so high
Ahah ahah ahah 
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea he called to me
Te dijo Te amo
I prayed that the days would last they went so fast
Tropical the island breeze all of nature wild and free
Ahah ahah ahah 
This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played the sun would set so high
Ahah ahah ahah 
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes your Spanish lullaby
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When its time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday not far away
Tropical the island breeze all of nature wild and free
Ahah ahah ahah 
This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played the sun would set so high
Ahah ahah ahah 
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes your Spanish lullaby
Papapapapa 
Tropical the island breeze all of nature wild and free
Ahah ahah ahah 
This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played the sun would set so high
Ahah ahah ahah 
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes your Spanish lullaby
