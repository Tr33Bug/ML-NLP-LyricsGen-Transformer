Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
When you call my name
Its like a little prayer
Im down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know Ill take you there
I hear your voice
Its like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God I think Im falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven help me
When you call my name
Its like a little prayer
Im down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know Ill take you there
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
Youre in control
Just like a child
Now Im dancing
Its like a dream
No end and no beginning
Youre here with me
Its like a dream
Let the choir sing
When you call my name
Its like a little prayer
Im down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know Ill take you there
When you call my name
Its like a little prayer
Im down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know Ill take you there
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
