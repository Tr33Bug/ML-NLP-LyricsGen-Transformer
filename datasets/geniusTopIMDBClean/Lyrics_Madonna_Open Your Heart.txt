Watch out
I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
Youd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way
Ive had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Dont try to resist me
Open your heart to me baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me darling
Ill give you love if you you turn the key
I think that youre afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy I wonder why
I follow you around but you cant see
Youre too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well Ive got something to say
Dont try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
Youve got to
Open your heart to me baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me darling
Ill give you love if you you turn the key
Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number


Ah ah ah ah 
Open your heart Ill make you love me
Its not that hard if you just turn the key
Dont try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
Youve got to
Open your heart to me baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me darling
Ill give you love if you you turn the key
Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number
Ah ah ah ah 
Open your heart Ill make you love me
Its not that hard if you just turn the key
Dont try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
Youve got to
Open your heart to me baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me darling
Ill give you love if you you turn the key
Open your heart with the key
Open your heart Ill make you love me   Come on baby
