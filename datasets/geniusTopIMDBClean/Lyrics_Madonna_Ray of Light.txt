Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
Shes got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Faster than the speeding light shes flying
Trying to remember where it all began
Shes got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Zephyr in the sky at night I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun
Shes got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years
Shes got herself a universe
Shes got herself a universe
Shes got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light shes flying
Quicker than a ray of light Im flying
