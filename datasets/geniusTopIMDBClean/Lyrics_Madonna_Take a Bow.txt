Take a bow the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low the curtains down
Theres no one here
Theres no one here theres no one in the crowd 
Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say when theres no one around
No one around 
Watching you watching me one lonely star
One lonely star you dont know who you are 
Ive always been in love with you  Always with you 
I guess youve always known its true  You know its true 
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye  Byebye 
Say goodbye
Make them laugh it comes so easy
When you get to the part where youre breaking my heart
Breaking my heart 
Hide behind your smile all the world loves a clown
Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown 
Wish you well I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
Role that you played 
No more masquerade youre one lonely star
One lonely star and you dont know who you are 
Ive always been in love with you  Always with you 
I guess youve always known its true  You know its true 
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say goodbye

Ive always been in love with you  Always with you 
I guess youve always known its true  You know its true 
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye  Byebye 
Say goodbye
All the world is a stage  World is a stage 
And everyone has their part  Has their part 
But how was I to know which way the storyd go
How was I to know youd break  Youd break youd break youd break 
Youd break my heart
Ive always been in love with you
Ive always been in love with you 
I guess youve always known
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say goodbye
Ive always been in love with you  Always with you 
I guess youve always known its true  You know its true 
You took my love for granted why oh why
The show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye  Byebye
