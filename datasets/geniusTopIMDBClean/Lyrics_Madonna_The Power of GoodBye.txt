Your heart is not open so I must go
The spell has been broken I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress you had to burn
Pain is a warning that somethings wrong
I pray to God that it wont be long
Do you wanna go higher
Theres nothing left to try
Theres no place left to hide
Theres no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Your heart is not open so I must go
The spell has been broken I loved you so
You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress
Theres nothing left to lose
Theres no more heart to bruise
Theres no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Learn to say goodbye
I yearn to say goodbye
Theres nothing left to try
Theres no more places to hide
Theres no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
Theres nothing left to lose
Theres no more heart to bruise
Theres no greater power
Than the power of goodbye
