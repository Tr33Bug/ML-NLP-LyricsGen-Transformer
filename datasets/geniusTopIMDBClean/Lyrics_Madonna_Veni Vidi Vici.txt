Madonna life is so crazy
Youve been through a lot
Ill tell you stories sometimes yknow
Seemed like yesterday I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday I was steppin to the beat
I had to pay my rent on the lower east side
I threw my tag around let Bboys take me for a ride
I started writing songs I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I cant explain
I didnt listen to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came I saw I conquered  Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered  Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered
Talk to em talk to em 
I expressed myself came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart I learned the power of goodbye
I saw a ray of light music saved my life  Music saved my life 
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I cant explain
I didnt listen to what people said  What you did 
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart  Yeah 
I never gave up fighting in the dark  Lets go 
I came I saw I conquered  Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered  Uh   Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered


In 1994 I came through the door  What 
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers  murdered murdered murdered 
My moms from the Carolinas pops from Natchez
And QBs where I started flowin
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick em dont I
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule Im too big to lose
Now whos the fool
And I aint never been happier no lie
Im just your humble servant Im Nas
If yall burn down Ferguson Ima riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trapper  trapper  any rapper  rapper 
Any politician beautician or musician
Anybody saw many bodies
Many coffins heads or tails
Penny tosses either that or jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from
I was fearless like a renegade  Try to tell em 
I had a feeling that I cant explain
I didnt listen to what people said
I came I saw I conquered
I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart  Yeah 
I never gave up fighting in the dark  Lets go 
I came I saw I conquered  Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered  Oohoohoohoohooh 
I came I saw I conquered
