Only yesterday they told me you were gone
All these normal people will I find another one
Monkey on my back aching in my bones
I forgot you said One day youll walk alone
I said I need you does that make me wrong
Am I a weak man are you feeling strong
My heart was blackened its bloody red
A hole in my heart a hole in my head
Who will help me up
Wheres the helping hand
Will you turn on me
Is this my final stand
In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
Im addicted addicted to chaos
Lights shined on my path turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks smashed cause I could
My brain was laboured my head would spin
Dont let me down dont give up dont give in
The rain comes down cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar welcome the unknown
Remember that you said One day youll walk alone
Who will help me up
Wheres the helping hand
Will you turn on me
Is this my final stand
Oh
In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
Im addicted to chaos


Who will help me up
Wheres the helping hand
Will you turn on me
Is this my final stand
Stand
In a dream I cannot see  In a dream I cannot see 
Tangled abstract fallacy  Tangled abstract fallacy 
Random turmoil builds in me  Random turmoil builds in me 
Builds it builds it builds
In a dream I cannot see  In a dream I cannot see 
Tangled abstract fallacy  Tangled abstract fallacy 
Random turmoil builds in me  Random turmoil builds in me 
Im addicted to the Im addicted addicted to chaos
Addicted
Addicted to chaos chaos
