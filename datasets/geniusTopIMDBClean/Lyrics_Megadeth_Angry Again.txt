The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask youre wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again angry again angry
And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again angry again angry
The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravitys got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face
Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cutout cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air


Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again angry again angry again and again and again again
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again angry again angry
