Down fell the stars as they splashed into the sea
Mi nomine Baphomet come dance with me
Sacrifice the virgins spiritual rites
Their masters time has come the moon is full tonight
Drinking dancing they worship and toast
The Devil whos watching with demons remote
Fire rising racing in your blood
Possessed nave his service done
Its the Sabbath
Bloody Sabbath
Bad omen of the goat
Bloody blasphemy
Sinisters the word as the demons take their fill
An orgys taking place human blood will spill
An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls
Satan has their souls they sing pagan tunes
The ceremony is sure to be cursed
They wait for his blessings but down comes the worst
Their bodies soulless a corpse from the grave
Their minds are helpless and no one can save
No one can save
No one can save
No one can save
No one can save one can know
No one can save one can know
