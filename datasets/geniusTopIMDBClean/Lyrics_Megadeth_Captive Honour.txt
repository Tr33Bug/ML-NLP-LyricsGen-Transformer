Madness comes and madness goes
An insane place with insane moves
Battles without for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up just breaking them in
Quickest way out quickest relief wins
Never disclose never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man youre a murderer
Kill many and youre a conqueror
Kill them all ooh oh youre a God
Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury have you reached a verdict
Yes we have your honour We find the defendant guilty on all counts for crimes against all humanity
By virtue of the jurys decision and the power vested in me by the state I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with no possibility of parole for life
Life What do you mean life I aint got a life
Boy your soul better belong to Jesus Mhmm cause your ass belongs to me hahahahahahahaha
Captive honour aint no honour
Captive honour aint no honour
No time for questions no time for games
Start kicking ass and taking down the names
A long shit list a shorter fuse
He is untouchable and guarantees youll lose
Captive honour aint no honour
Captive honour aint no honour
Inside the big house his nightmare unfolds
Before he got there his manpussy was sold
Black blanket welcome this tough guys now a bitch
Praying for death it cant be worse than this
Captive honour aint no honour
Captive honour aint no honour
Captive honour aint no honour
