Endangered species caged in fright
Shot in cold blood no chance to fight
The stage is set now pay the price
An ego boost dont think twice
Technology the battles unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudosafari the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned
All are gone all but one
No contest nowhere to run
No more left only one
This is it this is the countdown to extinction
Tell the truth you wouldnt dare
The skin and trophy oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt and take your turn
Liars anagram is lairs
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank youre so courageous
So courageous
All are gone all but one
No contest nowhere to run
No more left only one
This is it this is the countdown to extinction
One hour from now another species of life form will disappear off the face of the planet forever and the rate is accelerating
All are gone all but one
No contest nowhere to run
No more left only one
This is it this is the countdown to extinction
