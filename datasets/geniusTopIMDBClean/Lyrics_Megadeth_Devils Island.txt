The light that fills my lonely cell is blocked out by the key
That locks the door to this hell the place they wanted me
Times racing like the wind executions near
Oh Lord I wait for death and yes I have no fear
I recall that night my every breath and step along the way
Closed my eyes walking as danger paved the way
The Devil and the darkness let her evil wander free
Here on Devils Island the final stop for me
Devils Island
Devils Island
Oh there is no escape the sea is full of sharks
Tide takes you away and smash you on the rock
The sun is shining but feel not today
Its warmth its dying and fading away
Devils Island
Here I stay
Devils Island
Oh hear the call from the grave beyond
Oh so pernicious her soul it creates song
As there is no man that is here upon the Earth
Able to terminate our noisome will since birth
The priest that reads the sermon is walking next to me
To the stake my last request to have her burn with me
But so it did the heavens opened rain began to fall
The final judgment came and was spread before you all
Final judgment
Old weak and feeble and the lesson taught to me
Stay away from evil she doesnt care for me
She haunts me in my sleep though I tore that page away
Here on Devils Island Ill always have to stay
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Here I am
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
Devils Island
