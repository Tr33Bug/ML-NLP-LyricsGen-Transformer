Let me introduce myself
Im a social disease
Ive come for your wealth
Leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry
I got here on my own
I wont ask for mercy
I choose to walk alone
Whats yours is mine
Whats mine is mine too
If you shake my hand
Better count your fingers
What if I do get caught
What if there is no judgement
If Im right I lose nothing
If youre right I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because Im doing something wicked
Im guilty haunted by my fears
And the only consequences are dread and the fugitive mind
You built walls to protect you
So noone will infect you
Pursued by those out there
That vanish in thin air
Come a long way to find
What you really left behind
You dont know when the end is
But its coming fast
Whats yours is mine
Whats mine is mine too
If you shake my hand
Better count your fingers
What if I do get caught
What if there is no judgement
If Im right I lose nothing
If youre right I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because Im doing something wicked
Im guilty haunted by my fears
And the only consequences are dread and the fugitive mind
