Forgotten things remembered
The tigers eat their young
The body stayed but inside the head
The mind was on the run
A conspiracy of silence
The only way out of pain
Is turn around run through it man
Too wet to come in from the rain
Tell them I know they were doing it to you
But dont try doing it to me
Let me show you how I love you
Its our secret you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family
When you hear them saying Trust me
Dont wait to see whats next
Thrown to the wolves forever trusting
Raised in a form of living Hell
Sing a one note song of rage
Live and die within your heart
So beware in the shadows
Your family tree waits in the dark
I say I know they were doing it to you
But dont try doing it to me
No no
Let me show you how I love you
Its our secret you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family tree
Let me show you how I love you
Its our secret you and me
Let me show you how I love you
The secret heh of the family tree
Let me show you how I love you
Its our secret you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family tree  Only show you 
Let me show you how I love you  Only show you only show you 
Its our secret you and me  Its our secret 
Let me show you how I love you  Its our secret its our secret 
The secret of the family tree  The secret of the family 
Let me show you how I love you  Only show you 
Its our secret you and me  Whoa in the shadows 
Let me show you how I love you  Dont  
But keep it in the family tree
