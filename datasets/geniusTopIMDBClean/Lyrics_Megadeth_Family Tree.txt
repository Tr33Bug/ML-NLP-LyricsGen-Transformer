Family Tree Lyrics
Forgotten things remembered
The tigers eat their young
The body stayed, but inside the head
The mind was on the run
A conspiracy of silence
The only way out of pain
Is turn around, run through it, man
Too wet to come in from the rain
Tell them, "I know they were doing it to you
But don't try doing it to me."
Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family

When you hear them saying "Trust me"
Don't wait to see what's next
Thrown to the wolves, forever trusting
Raised in a form of living Hell
Sing a one note song of rage
Live and die within your heart
So beware in the shadows
Your family tree waits in the dark
I say, "I know they were doing it to you
But don't try doing it to me."
No, no...

Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family tree
Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
The secret, heh, of the family tree
You might also like

Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family tree (Only show you)
Let me show you how I love you (Only show you, only show you)
It's our secret, you and me (It's our secret)
Let me show you how I love you (It's our secret, it's our secret)
The secret of the family tree (The secret of the family)

Let me show you how I love you (Only show you)
It's our secret, you and me (Whoa, in the shadows)
Let me show you how I love you (Don't )
But keep it in the family tree... ()1Embed
