Bestow upon me knowledge
Wizard allknowing allwise
I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze now defiled
Dethrone the evil princes iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin
Parade the greyrobed monks
The vestal virgins wheel the wyverns in
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protg of five magics
Give me alchemy give me wizardry
Give me sorcery thermatology
Electricity magic if you please
Master all of these bring him to his knees
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
Possessed with Hellish torment  Possessed with Hellish torment 
I master magics five  I master magics five 
Hunting the abyss lord  Hunting the abyss lord 
Only one will stay alive  Only one will stay alive 
He who lives by the sword  He who lives by the sword 
Will surely also die  Will surely also die 
He who lives in sin  He who lives in sin 
Will surely live the lie
