Rise so high yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough euphorias high
More borrowed money more borrowed time
Backed in a corner caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Natures scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries loss of all pride
To leave aint believin so try and be tried
Insufficient funds insanity and suicide
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
The Congress will push me to raise taxes and Ill say no read my lips read my lips read my lips read my lips read my lips
Now with new hope some will be proud
This is no hoax no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed no dividend
Some may ask Why
Youll find the solution
The answers in the sky


Rise so high yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough euphorias high
More borrowed money more borrowed time
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Holocaust
