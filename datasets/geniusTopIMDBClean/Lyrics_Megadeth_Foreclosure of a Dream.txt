Foreclosure of a Dream Lyrics
Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time
Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believin', so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity, and suicide

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream


"The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, read my lips... read my lips... read my lips... read my lips... read my lips."

Now with new hope, some will be proud
This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed, no dividend
Some may ask "Why?"
You'll find the solution
The answer's in the sky
You might also like

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream
