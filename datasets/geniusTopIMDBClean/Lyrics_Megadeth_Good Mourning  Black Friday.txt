Good mourning
Hey I dont feel so good
Somethings not right
Somethings coming over me
What the fuck is this
Whoa
Killer intruder a homicidal man
If you see me coming run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon whos stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon sinister fiend
Bludgenous slaughters my evil deed
My hammers a cold piece of bloodlethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer I hack through their heads
Deviant defilers youre next to be dead
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent
Pounding surrounding slamming through your head
Yeah


Bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces til no features remain
A blade for the butchering I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs then cut off the head
The remains of the flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre the murders complete
I seek to dismember a sadist fiend
Bloodbaths my way of gettin clean
I lurk in the alley wait for the kill
Oh I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground
Im out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down
I see you and Im waiting for Black Friday
Turn me loose
Killer intruder a homicidal man
If you see me coming run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon whos stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon sinister fiend
Bludgenous slaughters my evil deed
A merciless butcher who lives underground
Im out to destroy and I will cut you down
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the wall
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the wall
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the wall
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the wall
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the wall
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the wall
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the wall
Its Black Friday paint the Devil on the
Devil on the Devil on the wall
