Welcome to our fortress tall
Ill take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For you see the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars
Possibly Ive seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much
Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesias the story
Believed foretold but who would suspect
The military intelligence
Two words combined that cant make sense
Possibly Ive seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much
