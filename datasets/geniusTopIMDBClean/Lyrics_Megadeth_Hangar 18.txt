Hangar 18 Lyrics
Welcome to our fortress tall
I'll take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For, you see, the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much

Foreign life forms, inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed, foretold, but who would suspect?
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much
