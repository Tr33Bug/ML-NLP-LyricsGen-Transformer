Holy Wars The Punishment Due Lyrics
Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I dont understand
Fools like me who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs
Do you kill on Gods command
A country thats divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand
The end is near its crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Dont look now to Israel
It might be your homeland
Holy wars
Upon my podium as the knowitall scholar
Down in my seat of judgement gavels bang uphold the law
Upon my soapbox a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holierthanthoucouldbemessenger of God
Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks rappel down the rocks behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me some people live to destroy me
Either way they die they die


They killed my wife and my baby with hopes to enslave me
First mistake last mistake
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake no more mistakes
Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I dont say it dont mean I aint thinking it
Next thing you know theyll take my thoughts away
I know what I said now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings mercy killings killings killings killings
Next thing you know theyll take my thoughts away
