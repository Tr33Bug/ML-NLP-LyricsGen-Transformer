Holy Wars... The Punishment Due Lyrics

Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand

Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs
"Do you kill on God's command?"
A country that's divided
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand

The end is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be your homeland

Holy wars...

Upon my podium as the “know-it-all” scholar
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Upon my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the “holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger” of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me, some people live to destroy me
Either way, they die... they die!

They killed my wife and my baby, with hopes to enslave me
First mistake... last mistake!
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake... no more mistakes!



Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings, mercy killings, killings, killings, killings

Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away45Embed
