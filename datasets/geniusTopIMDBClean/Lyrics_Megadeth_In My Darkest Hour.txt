In My Darkest Hour Lyrics
In my hour of need
Ha, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand

Through the darkest hour
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold, very cold
No one cares for me
Did you ever think I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think to stop thinking?
You're the only one that I'm thinking of

You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too

Things will be better
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you, I'm probably wrong

But, oh, how I lived my life for you
Still you'd turn away
Now, as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years, I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
Tell me who you think you are
You might also like
I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away

Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way


Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone, I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you, alone
So alone, I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain
Won't you hold me again?
You just laughed, ha-ha, you bitch
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all things shall pass
This good thing passed away
