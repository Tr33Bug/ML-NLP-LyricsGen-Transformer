In my hour of need
Ha no youre not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldnt lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold very cold
No one cares for me
Did you ever think Id get lonely
Did you ever think that I needed love
Did you ever think to stop thinking
Youre the only one that Im thinking of
Youll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too
Things will be better
When Im dead and gone
Dont try to understand
Knowing you Im probably wrong
But oh how I lived my life for you
Still youd turn away
Now as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head raise your face your eyes
Tell me who you think you are


I walk I walk alone
Into the promised land
Theres a better place for me
But its far far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please God send me on my way
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you alone
So alone Im lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain the pain the pain
Wont you hold me again
You just laughed haha you bitch
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all things shall pass
This good thing passed away
