Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! Lyrics
I am a sniper; always hit the mark
Paid assassin working after dark
Looking through the night using infra-red
Target's on you, aimed at your head

Ten thousand up front
Ten thousand when I'm through
And I know just what to do
And you know I'll do it, too
And I'm coming back for you
Oh, back for you
I do the "getting rid of"
Don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth
Don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly
And now we're through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you

Don't you know that
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good?
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good
Killing is my business, oh, and business is good
You'd better believe it
Ahahahahahahahaha!
