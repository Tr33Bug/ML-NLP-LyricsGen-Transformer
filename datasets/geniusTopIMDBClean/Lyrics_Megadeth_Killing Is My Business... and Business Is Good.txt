Killing Is My Business and Business Is Good Lyrics
I am a sniper always hit the mark
Paid assassin working after dark
Looking through the night using infrared
Targets on you aimed at your head
Ten thousand up front
Ten thousand when Im through
And I know just what to do
And you know Ill do it too
And Im coming back for you
Oh back for you
I do the getting rid of
Dont tell me why
Dont need to hear the truth
Dont need the lies
Now pay me quickly
And now were through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you
Dont you know that
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Killing is my business oh and business is good
Youd better believe it
Ahahahahahahahaha
Ah ah ah ah ah
