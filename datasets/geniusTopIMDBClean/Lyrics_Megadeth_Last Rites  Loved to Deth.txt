Wow
Whoa
Your bodys empty now as I hold you
Now youre gone I miss you but I told you
I remember bad times more than good
Theres no coming back even if we could
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
If I cant have you then no one will
And since I wont Ill have to kill
My only love something Ive never felt
Now youve gone to Heaven
And Ill burn in Hell
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
Whoa


Laughter
Oh and now Im down below what do I see
You didnt go to Heaven youre down in Hell with me
And now youre coming back Baby take me please
I really think I would if you werent such a sleaze
I loved you once before you kept me on a string
Id rather go without than take what you would bring
I loved you to death
Whoa
