You take great pride in never having lived up to anything
Lie steal cheat and kill a real bad guy
Your daddy is a wino and your mommys quite insane
From altar boy to sewer rat you dont give a damn
Your sister is a junkie gets it anyway she can
Your brothers a gay singer in a stud leather band
Your girlfriends got herpes to go with your Hep and AIDS
There aint one person you know you aint ripped off yet
Look deep in the mirror look deep into its eyes
Your face is replaced a creature you despise
But I know what youre made of it aint much Im afraid
I know youll be lying til your dying day
Make up your stories truths so hard to say
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimers disease
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories
Youre a liar liar liar
Everyone can see
Youre a liar liar liar
Its all youll ever be
Youre a liar liar liar
Its what you mean to me
Liar liar lies
Start trouble spread pain
Piss and venom in your veins
Talk nasty breathe fire
Smell rotten youre a liar
Sweat liquor breathe snot
Eat garbage spit blood
Diseased health hazard
Scumbag filthy bastard
Greasy face teeth decay
Hair matted drunk all day
Abscessed sunken veins
Rot gut scrambled brain
Steal money crash cars
Rob jewelry hock guitars
Rot in Hell its time you know
To your master off you go


Youre a liar
A fucking liar
Filthy liar
Liar
Ah you you you fucking liar
Youiar
