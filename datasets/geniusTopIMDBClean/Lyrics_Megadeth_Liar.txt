Liar Lyrics
You take great pride in never having lived up to anything
Lie, steal, cheat, and kill, a real bad guy
Your daddy is a wino, and your mommy's quite insane
From altar boy to sewer rat, you don't give a damn
Your sister is a junkie, gets it anyway she can
Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band
Your girlfriend's got herpes to go with your Hep and AIDS
There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet

Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eyes
Your face is replaced, a creature you despise
But I know what you're made of, it ain't much I'm afraid
I know you'll be lying 'til your dying day

Make up your stories, truth's so hard to say
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's disease
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories

You're a liar, liar, liar!
Everyone can see
You're a liar, liar, liar!
It's all you'll ever be
You're a liar, liar, liar!
It's what you mean to me
Liar, liar, lies!

Start trouble, spread pain
Piss and venom in your veins
Talk nasty, breathe fire
Smell rotten, you're a liar
Sweat liquor, breathe snot
Eat garbage, spit blood
Diseased, health hazard
Scumbag, filthy bastard
Greasy face, teeth decay
Hair matted, drunk all day
Abscessed, sunken veins
Rot gut, scrambled brain
Steal money, crash cars
Rob jewelry, hock guitars
Rot in Hell, it's time you know
To your master, off you go
You might also like
You're a liar!
A fucking liar!
Filthy liar!
Liar...
Ah, you, you, you fucking liar!
