Woahoh yeah
Now before they take me and my blessed life
Now youll know why Deth was summoned here tonight
Ill recall my perils theyll kill me in pride
No I cant run away theres no place to hide
Whoaoh
Though too much to live for I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation my death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt the altar theyve built high priests of sin
Destiny fate the wicked ones gate beckoning you in
Beckoning you in
Down the walkways through the bloodstained town
Looking down the cross bleeding from the crown
Led to stay to die beside the thieves
Kill the king of the world to be
And now to you this will come a putrefying pestilence
More noxious than the serpents breath malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of Choronzon
More disease than the wind of the moonlight sun
Putrefaction you have caused no need for confession
Now you wish you had a god to stop your demolition
Crushing the bones of the hundredfolds
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man woman child no one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner
And this was all you got so don these broken wings
The sands of time run out bells of Hades ring
Is this a nightmare to unhallow thy name
Smell of brimstone dancing in the flames
No help now as you fulfill his task
Chief of evil has got you by the ass
Set free to sit upon the throne
Just a dream Youre weeping all alone


Looking down the cross speak no evil
Im looking down the cross speak no evil
Looking down the cross speak no evil
Im looking down the cross speak no evil
Whoaohoh
