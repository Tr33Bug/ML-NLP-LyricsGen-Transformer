Forgive me father for I have sinned
Im a child of the air Im a witch of the wind
And Im still wide awake
Mary Jane
From the earth up through the trees
I can hear her calling me
Her voice rides on the breeze
Oh its haunting me
No cant get away
No theres no escape  Im going crazy 
If I know Im going crazy
I must not be insane
Ooh hoo hoo 
Beware my friends as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As Im now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me
Forgive me father for I have sinned
Im a child of the air Im a witch of the wind
Fingers gripped around my brain
No control my mind is lame
Im in the astral plane and Ill never be the same
Never never never never never never never never never
Beware my friends as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As Im now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me
It hurts so bad
I cant breathe
Prepare to follow me
