Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
Youre a burner yeah a real motor car
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just wont do yknow lucky for you
Whoever thought youd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh yeahyeah
We were shifting gears hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end you know it feels too slow
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just wont do yknow lucky for you
Whoever thought youd be better
At turning a screw than me
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh yeahyeah
Im giving you my room service
And you know its more than enough
Oh one more time you know Im in love


Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just wont do yknow lucky for you

At turning a screw than me

Made my drive shaft crank made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh yeahyeah
