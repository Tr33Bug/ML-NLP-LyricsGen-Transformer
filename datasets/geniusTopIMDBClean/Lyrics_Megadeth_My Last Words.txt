My lifes on time but again my sense is late
Feel a might unsteady but still I have to play
Six to ones the odds and we have the highest stakes
Once again I gamble with my very life today
Highly polished metal the oil makes it gleam
Fill the terror chamber your mind begins to scream
Your life is like a trigger never trouble til youre squeezed
Now you crack a smile as you give the gun a tease
Place the pistol down now give the gun a spin
Soon as the spinning stops oh no the game starts in
A hateful way of vengeance a bit of playful sin
Load another bullet the second round begins
A couple grains of powder a couple grams of lead
A touch against the trigger a touch inside the head
Take another drink and raise the last bets
Think about my last words they might be what I just said
A click comes from the hammer that couldnt drive a nail
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades grill
A fraction of a second do you lose or maybe still
Pass it to the left and collect your mighty kill
Add another bullet the third round begins
Soon as the spinning stops oh no the game starts in
Please no IOUs no markers for death
Does anybody play
Anybody Somebody Anybody play
You  You  next victim
You next to die
You  You  next victim
You your turn to die
You  Come on  next victim
You your turn to die
You  Come on  next victim
You your turn to die
You die
