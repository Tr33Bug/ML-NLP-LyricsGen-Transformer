What do you mean I dont believe in God
I talk to Him every day
What do you mean I dont support your system
I go to court when I have to
What do you mean I cant get to work on time
Got nothing better to do
And what do you mean I dont pay my bills
Why do you think Im broke Huh
If theres a new way
Oh Ill be the first in line
But it better work this time
What do you mean I hurt your feelings
I didnt know you had any feelings
What do you mean I aint kind
Im just not your kind
What do you mean I couldnt be the president
Of the United States of America
Tell me something
Its still we the people right
If theres a new way
Oh Ill be the first in line
But it better work this time
Ohohoh
Can you put a price on peace
Peace peace sells
Peace peace sells
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
Peace sells but whos buying
No nononono
Peace sells
Peace sells 
Peace sells
Argh
