I miss the warm embrace I felt
First time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known youd crush me
A snake you were when we met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poisoned fangs
The venom never goes away
Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackyl speaking with my tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain
Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
Im the sun that beats your brow in
Til I finally threw the towel in
Never knowing if Id wake up in a whirlpool got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood in a cesspool I became dead
From a rockstar to a desk fool was my destiny someone said
Loves a tide pool taste the water lifes abundant
Taste me
