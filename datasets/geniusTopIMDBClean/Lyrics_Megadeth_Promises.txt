Two hearts that shouldnt
Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell
People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories theyd tell
If anyone would listen
If anyone would listen
You come from a town where
People dont bother saying Hello
Unless somebodys born or dies
And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But its much too late when the fear is gone
I will meet you in the next life  I promise you 
Where we can be together  I promise you 
I will wait til then in Heaven  I promise you 
I promise I promise
Theres so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved
Their intentions arent that good
And I can smell the asphalt
Thats their personal road to Hell being paved
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
And its much too late when the fear is gone
I will meet you in the next life  I promise you 
Where we can be together  I promise you 
I will wait til then in Heaven  I promise you 
I promise I promise
I will meet you in the next life  I promise you 
Where we can be together  I promise you 
I will wait til then in Heaven  I promise you 
I promise I promise
