Well here I come
Stand up and plant your feet
Listen Im letting off steam
Now throw your hands in the air
Let it loose I dont fuckin care
Rattlehead
A dose of Metal you need
To bang your head til you bleed
Its time for snapping some necks
Slashing thrashing to Megadeth
Rattlehead
You your head is pounding with pain
You shake loose parts of your brain
Winning sinning beginning
Feeding the needing for bleeding
Bashing smashing crashing
Frying annihilating you hahahaha
Theres someone back in the shadows
You feel though you cant see his eyes
Hell bash your head if you cross him
Aint quite your average guy
Dont wear no leather to fit in
Dont wear no spikes to be cool
Dont want no woman beside him
Just make it fast loud and rude
Rattlehead
Im a Rattlehead
Rattle your goddamn head
