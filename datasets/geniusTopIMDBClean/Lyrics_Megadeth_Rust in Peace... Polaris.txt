Rust in Peace Polaris Lyrics
Tremble you weaklings cower in fear
I am your ruler  land sea and air
Immense in my girth erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My systems locked in on military gluttons
I rule on land air and sea
I pass judgement on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning Only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head
To spit into the wind
I spread disease like a dog discharge my payload
A mile high rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog discharge my payload
A mile high rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris
The end doesnt scare us
When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace
Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Heh survival such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns your flesh creeps
I rule on land air and sea
Pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning Only time will tell
I spread disease like a dog discharge my payload
A mile high rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog discharge my payload
A mile high rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils


Launch the Polaris
The end doesnt scare us
When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace
High priest of holocaust fire from the sea
Nuclear winter spreading disease
The day of final conflict all pay the price
The third world war rapes peace takes life
Back to the start talk of the part
When the Earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days were black as night
I spread disease like a dog discharge my payload
A mile high rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog discharge my payload
A mile high rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris
It doesnt scare us
When will this cease
The warheads will all rust in peace
Eradication of
Earths population loves Polaris
Eradication of
Earths population loves Polaris
Eradication of
Earths population loves Polaris
Eradication of
Earths population loves Polaris
