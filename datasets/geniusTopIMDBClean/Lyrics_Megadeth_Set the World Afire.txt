I dont want to set the world on fire
Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky
They said itd never come we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye the end has just begun
Distorted figures walk the street its 1999
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines
Bodies melted like a candle a land without a face
No time to change your fate no time left its too late
The arsenal of megadeath cant be rid they said
And if it comes the living will envy the dead
Racing for power and all come in last
No winning first stone cast
This falsehood worldly peace
Its treaties soon will cease
No one will be left to prove that humans existed
Maybe soon the children will be born openfisted
We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke
Too bad they couldnt see this lethal energy
And now the final scene a global darkening
Dig deep piles of rubble and ruins
Towering overhead both far and wide
Theres unknown tools for World War III
Einstein said Well use rocks on the other side
No survivors
Set the world afire
No survivors set the world afire
