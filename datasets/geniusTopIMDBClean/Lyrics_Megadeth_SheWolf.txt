The mother of all that is evil
Her lips are poisonous venom
Wicked temptress knows how to please
Priestess roars Get down on your knees
The rite of the praying mantis
Kiss the bones of the enchantress
Spellbound searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight
The fight
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the shewolf
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the shewolf
My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heartbeat than my own
The sound of claws on cobblestone
Im stoned
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the shewolf
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the shewolf
Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the shewolf and her bite
Her mystic lips tell only lies
Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the shewolf and her bite
Her hidden will to kill in disguise
