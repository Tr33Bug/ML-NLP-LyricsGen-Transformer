I had wrists donning slits
Flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hitandrun
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wetbrained neighbor cranes
His neck to see
In time the white lights a train
Bearing down on me
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
I wont feel the hurt
Im not trash any longer
That that doesnt kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
Thats what 911 is for
So tag my toe and dont forget
Ooh to close the drawer
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o my teeth
