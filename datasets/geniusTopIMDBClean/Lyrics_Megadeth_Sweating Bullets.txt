Hello me meet the real me and my misfits way of life
A dark black past is my most valued possession
Hindsight is always 2020
But looking back its still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction
Nice story tell it to Readers Digest
Feeling paranoid true enemy or false friend
Anxietys attacking me and my air is getting thin
Im in trouble for the things I havent got to yet
Im chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets
Hello me its me again
You can subdue but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache sinking down to your level
Yeah just keep on thinking its my fault
And stay an inch or two out of kicking distance
Mankind has got to know his limitations
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I dont know where Ive been
Oh Im in trouble for the things I havent got to yet
Im sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets
I hear it in here
Blood stains on my hands
The big axe
Ha ha ha ha ha
Sweating sweating
Sweating sweating
Sweating sweating


Well me its nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Someday you too will know my pain
And smile its blacktoothed grin
If the war inside my head wont take a day off Ill be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again
Feeling paranoid true enemy or false friend
Anxietys attacking me and my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I dont know where Ive been
Once youve committed me  Committed me 
Now youve acquitted me  Acquitted me 
Claiming validity  Validity 
For your stupidity  Stupidity 
Im chomping at the bit
Im sharpening the axe
Oh here I come again whoa
Sweating bullets
