You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch peoples heads aroll
Aroll aroll
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony of destruction
Actin like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes explodes
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony of destruction
The Earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
Awarring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Atall atall
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony of destruction
