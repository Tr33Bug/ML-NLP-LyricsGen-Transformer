Got one chance  Infiltrate them 
Get it right  Terminate them 
The Panzers will  Permeate them 
Break their pride  Denigrate them 
And their people  Retrograde them 
Typhus  Deteriorate them 
Epidemic  Devastate them 
Take no prisoners  Cremate them 
Burn
Going to war give em hell
DDay next stop Normandy
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit well win
War is peace sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk this world
Bereft of heart and soul
Love and war they say all is fair
Take his life but wont take his hair
Your body parts your country spares
By the way son heres your wheelchair
He once had to be all he could be
Now hes nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing hes like you and me
Its a funny thing funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke no one even cared
Dont ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you
Take no prisoners  Take no shit 
Take no prisoners  Take no shit 
Take no prisoners  Take no shit 
Take no prisoners take no shit  Shit
