Welcome to our sanguinary sect of worship
Feel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathematise all those who oppose us
Dont summon the Devil dont call the priests
If you need the strength the conjuring
Obey
Behold the flames rise from the compass cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil and with the ashes youll anoint
Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician
Light the candles place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves place the lash from a black cats eye
A straw of a broom fold and burn and centralize
Dont summon the Devil dont call the priests
If you need the strength then conjure me
I am the Devils advocate
A salesman if you will
You know my name you know my name
I met your father years ago
I gave him what hed please
He called my name and youll do the same
Im claiming what is mine by right
Its time to close the deal
Youre bought and sold bought and sold
Come join me in my infernal depths
Mephistos hall of fame
Ive got your soul Ive got your soul
The conjuring
Obey
