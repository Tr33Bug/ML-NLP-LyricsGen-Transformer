Whoa
Whoa
Mean and infectious the evil prophets rise
Dance of the Macabre as witches streak the sky
Decadent worship of black magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devils Dungeon trapped without a plea oh
Seething in agony necrosis is the fate
Pins stickin through the skin the venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life no one hears a sound
Help me
Prepare the patients scalp to peel away
Metal caps his ears hell hear not what we say
Solid steel visor riveted across his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries
The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath
Now youre drawn and quartered your bones will make the X
Symbol stands for poison and its chained to your head
And as we fold your arms to make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix religion has been lost
The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin
