Justified obliteration
No one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of coverups
Will leprosy touch their flesh
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out
The weakest link
A deadly strike
The threat is real
See the burnished images
Of a crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning
Caused the nature of the enemy
Your terminal lack of vision
Blinded eyes see no light
A chronic lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive
A fatal shot
A lust for blood
The final act
The threat is real
Justified obliteration
No one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of coverups
Will leprosy touch their flesh
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest


The clock runs out
The weakest link
A deadly strike
The threat is real
A fatal shot
A lust for blood
The final act
The threat is real
