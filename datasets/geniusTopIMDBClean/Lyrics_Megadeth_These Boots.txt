You keep sayin you got somethin for me
Somethin you call love but I call sex
Youve been kissin when you oughtabe screwin
And now someone else can kiss your ass
These boots are made for walkin and thats just what theyll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
You been lyin and there aint no believin
And you keep sayin what you want in the bed
You been stayin when you oughtabea leavin
And whats right is right but you aint been right yet
These boots are made for walkin thats just what theyll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
You keep dressin ways you shouldnt be dressin
And you keep thinkin that youll never get burned ha
I just found me a brandnew box spring mattress
What You know bitch you got a lot to learn
These boots are made for walkin and thats just what theyll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna stomp all over you
Yeah
Are you ready boots
Are you ready boots
Are you ready boots
Start walkin
And you think Im kiddin dontcha
