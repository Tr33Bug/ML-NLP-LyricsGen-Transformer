It was just another day
It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right
There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I cant do
Lying on your bed examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
Hey this was my life
Hey this was my fate
This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin
Now theres motives for the suspect
Now theres nothing left to say
And now theres method to the madness
And now theres society to pay
Lying on your bed examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits


Hey this was my life
Hey this was my fate
In our life theres if
In our beliefs theres lie
In our business theres sssin
In our bodies theres die
This was my life
This was my fate
This was my life
This was my fate
