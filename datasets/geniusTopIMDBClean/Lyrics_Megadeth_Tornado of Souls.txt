This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up I wanted to cry
But dammit this wells gone dry
Not for the money
Not for the fame
Not for the power
Just no more games
But now Im safe in the eye of a tornado
I cant replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside in her way Ill surely die
In the eye of the tornado blow me away
Youll grow to loathe my name
Youll hate me just the same
You wont need your breath
And soon youll meet your death
Not from the years
Not from the use
Not from the tears
Just selfabuse
But now Im safe in the eye of a tornado
I cant replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside in her way Ill surely die
In the eye of the tornado blow me away
Whos to say whats for me to say
Whos to say whats for me to be
Whos to say whats for me to do
Cause a big nothing itll be for me
The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think Ive seen the light
Cant say whats on my mind
Cant do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep I really feel
I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twists perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
Youll feel my fingertips
You wont forget my lips
Youll feel my cold breath
Its the kiss of death
