Im doing you a favor
As Im taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I dont even trust me
Theres bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
How do you do My name is Trouble
Im coming in for the kill
In for the kill
Ooh and you know I will
Set the ball arolling
Ill be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
Im tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There aint no turning back oh
No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
Im blowing on my cards
And I play them to my chest
Lifes fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread
As for me I hocked my brains
Packed my bags and headed west ah
I hocked my brains
Headed west
Oh set the ball arolling
Ill be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
Im tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There aint no turning back
Oh set the ball arolling
Ill be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
Im tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There aint no turning back
Set the ball arolling
Ill be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life of style
My thinking is derailed
Im tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There aint no turning back
Hahahahahaha
