Lost in a dream nothings what it seems
Searching my head for the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes as we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays of you walking away
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
Time and again she repeats Lets be friends
I smile and say Yes
Another truth bends I must confess
I try to let go but I know well never end til were dust
We lied to each other again  I wish I could trust 
But I wish I could trust
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God help me please on my knees  on my knees 
Betrayed by lust  by lust 
We lied to each other so much  so much 
Now theres nothing we trust
How could this be happening to me
Im lying when I say Trust me
I cant believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering


My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God help me please on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much  so much 
Now theres nothing we trust
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much  we lied to each other so much 
That theres nothing we trust
God help me please on my knees
Betrayed by lust  lust 
We lied to each other so much
Absolutely nothing we trust
