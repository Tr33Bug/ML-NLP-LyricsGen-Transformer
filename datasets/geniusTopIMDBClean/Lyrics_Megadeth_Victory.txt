Now one day I started telling everyone that
Killing Is My Business and I was hung like a martyr
For Looking Down the Cross my Skull Beneath the Skin
Prophesied Last Rites Loved to Death my friends
Then I started seeing Bad Omens in my head
Good Mourning Black Friday will I Wake Up Dead
If I Aint Superstitious then this wont mean a thing
But some crazy shit has happened since The Conjuring
Not even close not even close
Not even close to overdose
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
Came Anarchy to Set the World Afire
Pain of Hook in Mouth In My Darkest Hour
Corruption of the world Peace Sells nobodys Buying
Ignorant religion Holy Wars and the dying
Tornado nearly got me by the Skin o My Teeth
This Was My Life Foreclosure of My Dreams
May the past Rust in Peace in Hangar 18
And Countdown to Extinction just be a bad dream
Lucretia said
Not even close not even close
Not even close to overdose
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
Not even close not even close
Not even close to overdose
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
Had fingers in my eyes had needles in my veins
A knife right through my heart I am a victory
