I sneak in my own house
Its four in the morning
Ive had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her
Ill wake up dead
Ooh I wonder will she find out
About the other other lover Diana
Wake up dead  You die 
Wake up dead  And buried 
Wake up dead  You die 
Wake up dead
