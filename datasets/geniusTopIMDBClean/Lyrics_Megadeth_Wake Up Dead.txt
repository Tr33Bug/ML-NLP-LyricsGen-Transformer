Wake Up Dead Lyrics
I sneak in my own house
It's four in the morning
I've had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her
I'll wake up dead



Ooh, I wonder, will she find out
About the other, other lover, Diana?


Wake up dead (You die)
Wake up dead (And buried)
Wake up dead (You die)
Wake up deadYou might also like5Embed
