The quiet war has begun with silent weapons
And the new slavery is to keep the people
Poor and stupid Novus Ordo Seclorum
How can there be any logic in biological war
We all know this is wrong
But the New World Orders beating down the door
Oh something needs to be done
There was a king an evil king
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery no prophet could interpret
Of seven years of famine
The wolf is at my door as predicted years ago
That that was that is that is no more
The word predicts the future and tells the truth about the past
Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharaoh
The eighth false king to the throne
Washington is next
Disengage their minds sabotage their health
Promote sex and war and violence in the kindergartens
Blame the parents and teachers
Its their fault Annuit Coeptis
Attack the church dynamic attack the family
Keep the public undisciplined til nothing left is sacred
And the havenots get hooked
And have to go to the haves just to cop a fix


I am the king an evil king
Who dreams the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery nobody could interpret
Of seven empires falling
The wolf is at my door as predicted years ago
That that was that is that is no more
The word predicts my future and tells the truth about my past
Of how the worlds leaders are waiting to usher in
The eighth world power of modern Rome
Washington is next
There was a king an evil king
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery no prophet could interpret
Of seven empires falling
The wolf is at my door as predicted years ago
That that was that is that is no more
I am a king and I dream the wildest dreams
And nobody could interpret
Seven empires falling the wolf is at my door
Oh that that was that is that is no more
Theres something at my door some ancient mystery
The future tells the truth about my past
And Im the eighth false king to the throne
Ive got you in my crosshairs now aint that a bitch
Washington youre next
