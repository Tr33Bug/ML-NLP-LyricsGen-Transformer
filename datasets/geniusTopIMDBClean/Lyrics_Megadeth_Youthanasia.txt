Whod believe with the way things are here
Wed be goin anywhere telling people how to live
Whod believe wed spend more shippin drugs and guns than to educate our sons
Sorry but thats what they did
I cant help but think
I cant help but think
Oh I cant help but think
Someones forsaken you and me
Luck deserted me and the truth beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things
Ive stepped over lots of bodies on my way
Thanks for the information dont need no more anything
I cant help but think
I cant help but think
Oh I cant help but think
Someones forsaken you and me
We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
Weve been hung out to dry
You didnt want us anyway
And now were making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia


We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
Weve been hung out to dry
You didnt want us anyway
And now were making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia
We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We run for youthanasia
