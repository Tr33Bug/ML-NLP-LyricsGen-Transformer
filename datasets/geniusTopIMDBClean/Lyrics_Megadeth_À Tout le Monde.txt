Tout le Monde Lyrics
Dont remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what itd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied
So as you read this know my friends
Id love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My bodys gone thats all
tout le monde  tous mes amis
Je vous aime je dois partir
These are the last words Ill ever speak
And theyll set me free
If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
Theres nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred
tout le monde  tous mes amis
Je vous aime je dois partir
These are the last words Ill ever speak
And theyll set me free
So as you read know my friends
Id love to stay with you all
Please smile smile when you think about me
My bodys gone thats all


tout le monde  tous mes amis
Je vous aime je dois partir
These are the last words Ill ever speak
And theyll set me free
tout le monde  tous mes amis
Je vous aime je dois partir
These are the last words Ill ever speak
And theyll set me free
