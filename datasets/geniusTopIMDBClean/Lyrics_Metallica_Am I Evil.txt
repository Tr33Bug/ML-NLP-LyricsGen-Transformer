My mother was a witch she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch for the tears I cried
Take her down now dont want to see her face
All blistered and burnt cant hide my disgrace
Twentyseven everyone was nice
Got to see them make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil Yes I am
Am I evil I am man yes I am
As I watched my mother die I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances you come with me
Ill split you to the bone help set you free
Twentyseven everyone was nice
Got to see them make them pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time
Am I evil Yes I am
Am I evil I am man yes I am
On with the action now Ill strip your pride
Ill spread your blood around Ill see you writhe
Your face is scarred with steel wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before you smells so sweet


Am I evil Yes I am
Am I evil I am man yes I am
Ill make my residence Ill watch your fire
You can come with me sweet desire
My face is long forgot my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore take me home
Am I evil Yes I am
Am I evil I am man yes I am
My soul is longing for await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother sweep myself
My face is long forgot my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore take me home
Am I evil Yes I am
Am I evil I am man yes I am
Am I evil Yes I fuckin am
Am I evil I am man yes I am yeah
