Bitterness and burden
Curses thrust on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the masses blame rejection
Hold the pose feign perception
Grudges break your back
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas rise
How does it feel on your own
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas rise
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me


Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas rise
How does it feel on your own
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas rise
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone thy fears shall humble
Swallow all your pride
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas rise
How does it feel on your own
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas rise
