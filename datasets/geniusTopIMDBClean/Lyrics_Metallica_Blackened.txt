Blackened is the end winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth never her rebirth
Evolutions end never will it mend
Never
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of Earth terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill nothing left to kill
Never seen before breathing nevermore
Never
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blackened
Opposition  Opposition 
Contradiction  Contradiction 
Premonition  Premonition 
Compromise
Agitation  Agitation 
Violation  Violation 
Mutilation  Mutilation 
Planet dies
Darkest color blistered Earth
True death of life
Termination  Termination
Expiration  Expiration
Cancellation  Cancellation human race
Expectation  Expectation
Liberation  Liberation
Population  Population laid to waste
See our mother put to death  Death 
See our mother die
Smoldering decay take her breath away
Millions of our years in minutes disappears
Darkening in vain decadence remains
All is said and done never is the sun
Never
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened
Blackened
