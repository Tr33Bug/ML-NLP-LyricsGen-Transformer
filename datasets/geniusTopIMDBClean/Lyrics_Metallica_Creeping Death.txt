Slaves Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait something must be done
Fourhundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
Im sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
Im creeping death
Now let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague darkness three days long
Hail to fire
So let it be written
So let it be done
Im sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
Im creeping death
Die  Die 
By my hand  Die die 
I creep across the land  Die die 
Killing firstborn man  Die die die 
Die  Die 
By my hand  Die die 
I creep across the land  Die die 
Killing firstborn man  Die die die 


I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood lambs bloodpainted door
I shall pass
So let it be written
So let it be done
Im sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
Im creeping death
