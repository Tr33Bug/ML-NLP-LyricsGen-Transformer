Bodies fill the fields I see hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be a servant til I fall
Soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
Twentyone only son but he served us well
Bred to kill not to care do just as we say
Finished here greeting death hes yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward you servant you blind man
Barking of machinegun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks get used to it somehow
More a man more stripes you wear glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see the slaughter never ends
Soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
Twentyone only son but he served us well
Bred to kill not to care do just as we say
Finished here greeting death hes yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward you servant you blind man


Why am I dying
Kill have no fear
Lie live off lying
Hell hell is here
Why am I dying
Kill have no fear
Lie live off lying
Hell hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself molded day by day
Looking back I realize nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy made of clay now an empty shell
Twentyone only son but he served us well
Bred to kill not to care do just as we say
Finished here greeting death hes yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward you servant you blind man
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
