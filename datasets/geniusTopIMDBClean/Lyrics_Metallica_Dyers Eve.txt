Dear mother dear father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer deceiver
Day in day out lived my life through you
Pushed onto me whats wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear mother dear father
Every thought Id think youd disapprove
Curator dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality Im living blindly
Dear mother dear father
Time has frozen still whats left to be
Hear nothing say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee its life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
Dear mother dear father
You clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled unspoken
Ive outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing Ive always heard from you
Do as I say not as I do
Innocence torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality Im living blindly
Im in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me


Dear mother dear father
Hidden in your world youve made for me
Im seething Im bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew
