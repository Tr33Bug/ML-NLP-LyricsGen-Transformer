Say your prayers little one dont forget my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in warm within keep you free from sin
Til the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Were off to nevernever land
Somethings wrong shut the light heavy thoughts tonight
And they arent of Snow White
Dreams of war dreams of liars dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite yeah
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Were off to nevernever land
Yeahhah
Now I lay me down to sleep  Now I lay me down to sleep 
Pray the Lord my soul to keep  Pray the Lord my soul to keep 
If I die before I wake  If I die before I wake 
Pray the Lord my soul to take  Pray the Lord my soul to take 
Hush little baby dont say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
Its just the beasts under your bed
In your closet in your head


Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Were off to nevernever land  yeah haha haha
