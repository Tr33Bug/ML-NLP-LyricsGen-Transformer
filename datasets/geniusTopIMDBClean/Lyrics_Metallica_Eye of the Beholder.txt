Do you see what I see Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel Bittering distress
Who decides what you express
Do you take what I take Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesnt matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If its done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need Boundaries overthrown
Look inside to each his own
Do you trust what I trust Me myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen I see through the selfish lie
Doesnt matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If its done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception


Do you know what I know Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence lengthen freedoms ring
Doesnt matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If its done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesnt matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If its done just how I say
