Give me fuel give me fire
Give me that which I desire ooh

Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse warhead
Fuck em man whiteknuckle tight
Through black and white
Ooh on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard loose and clean
And I burn churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So give me fuel give me fire
Give me that which I desire
Hey

Swallow future spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome

Take the corner join the crash
Headlights headlines

Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard loose and clean
And I burn churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So give me fuel give me fire
Give me that which I desire ooh yeahheh

Give me fuel  On I burn on and on 
Give me fire  On I burn on and on

So give me fuel give me fire
Give me that which I desire
