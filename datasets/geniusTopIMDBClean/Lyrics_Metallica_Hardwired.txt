Hardwired Lyrics
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation, gone insane

We're so fucked, shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Go

On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to the great destroyer, doomed design
We're so fucked, shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Oh


Once upon a planet burning, once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning all in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading? Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating in the end?

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destructYou might also like14Embed
