In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation gone insane
Were so fucked shit outta luck
Hardwired to selfdestruct
Go
On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to the great destroyer doomed design
Were so fucked shit outta luck
Hardwired to selfdestruct
Oh
Once upon a planet burning once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning all in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading Do you comprehend
Do you feel it terminating in the end
Were so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to selfdestruct
Hardwired to selfdestruct
Selfdestruct
Selfdestruct
Selfdestruct
