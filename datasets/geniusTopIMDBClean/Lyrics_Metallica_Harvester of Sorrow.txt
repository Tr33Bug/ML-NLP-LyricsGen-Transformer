My life suffocates planting the seeds of hate
Ive loved turned to hate trapped far beyond my fate
I give you take this life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth youve turned this lie to truth
Anger misery youll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow  Language of the mad 
Harvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear my work is done soon here
Try getting back to me get back which used to be
Drink up shoot in let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain your loss becomes my gain
Anger misery youll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow  Language of the mad 
Harvester of sorrow
All have said their prayers invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes youll find where murder lies
Infanticide
Harvester of sorrow  Language of the mad 
Harvester of sorrow  Language of the mad 
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
