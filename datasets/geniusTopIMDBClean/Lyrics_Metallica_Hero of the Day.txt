Mama they try and break me
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where theyve gone
Theyre off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someones wicked way
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name
Did you hear your babies crying
Mama they try and break me
Still they try and break me
Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
Dont want your aid
But the fist I make
For years cant hold or feel
No Im not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall behind it crawl
And hide until its light
So can you hear your babies crying now
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns  The window burns 
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names
Did you hear your babies crying


But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall behind it crawl
And hide until its light
So cant you hear your babies crying now
Mama they try and break me
Mama they try and break me
Mama they try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try
Mama they try and break me  Mama they try and break me 
Mama they try and break me  Mama they try and break me 
Mama they try and break me  Mama they try and break me 
Mama they try
Mama they try
