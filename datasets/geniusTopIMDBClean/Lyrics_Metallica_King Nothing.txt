Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied
Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified
All the wants you waste
All the things youve chased
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But theres no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castles crumbled
And youre left with just a name
Wheres your crown King Nothing
Wheres your crown
Hot and cold
Bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold yeah
Are you satisfied
Wish I might
Wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified
All the wants you waste
All the things youve chased
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But theres no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castles crumbled
And youre left with just a name
Wheres your crown King Nothing
Wheres your crown
Oh nothing
Oh wheres your crown
I wish I may
I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star
I want it now
I want it all and I dont care how
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish
You may regret it
Careful what you wish
You just might get it
Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But theres no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castles crumbled
And youre left with just a name
Wheres your crown King Nothing
Nothing
No youre just nothing
Wheres your crown King Nothing
No youre just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to nevernever land
