One two
One two three four one
Spineless from the start sucked into the part
Circus comes to town you play the lead clown
Please please spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees knees falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory you will
Time for lust time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money send me green heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and youll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah
Marvel at his tricks need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came rotting your brain
Chain chain join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame fame infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power we see
Time for lust time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money send me green heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and youll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah
Witchery weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap hypnotize
Now you follow


Time for lust time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money send me green heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and youll get the better seat
Lie lie lie lie
Lie lie lie lie
