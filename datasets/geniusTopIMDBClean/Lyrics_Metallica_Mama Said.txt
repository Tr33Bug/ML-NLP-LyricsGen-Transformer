Mama she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son your lifes an open book
Dont close it fore its done
The brightest flame burns quickest
Is what I heard her say
A sons hearts owned to Mother
But I must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Or let this heart be still  be still 
Rebel my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still


Mama now Im coming home
Im not all you wished of me
But a mothers love for her son
Unspoken help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me yeahyeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stones all I see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
