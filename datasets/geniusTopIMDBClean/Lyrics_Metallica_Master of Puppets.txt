End of passion play crumbling away
Im your source of selfdestruction
Veins that pump with fear sucking darkest clear
Leading on your deaths construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How Im killing you
Come crawling faster  Faster 
Obey your master  Master 
Your life burns faster  Faster 
Obey your
Master master
Master of puppets Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me you cant see a thing
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream
Master master
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream
Master master
Needlework the way never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How Im killing you
Come crawling faster  Faster 
Obey your master  Master 
Your life burns faster  Faster 
Obey your
Master master
Master of puppets Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me you cant see a thing
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream
Master master
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream
Master master
Master master master master 
Master master
Wheres the dreams that Ive been after
Master master
You promised only lies
Laughter laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
Come crawling faster  Faster 
Obey your master  Master 
Your life burns faster  Faster 
Obey your
Master master
Master of puppets Im pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me you cant see a thing
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream
Master master
Just call my name cause Ill hear you scream
Master master
