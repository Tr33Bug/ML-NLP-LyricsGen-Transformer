Blacked out
Pop queen amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence
Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless
Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral
Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral
Light it up
Ah light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah kill the truth
Youre falling but you think youre flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now youre thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution
Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin
Light it up
Ah light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah tell the truth
Youre falling but you think youre flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now youre thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn
Guarantee your name you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one wont do that fistful will
Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction
Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction
So light it up
Ah light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah no excuse
Youre falling but you think youre flying high
High again
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now youre thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Addicted to the fame
