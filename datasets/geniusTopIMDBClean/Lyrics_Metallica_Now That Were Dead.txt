When darkness falls may it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When were seduced then may it be
That we not deviate our cause
All sinners a future
All saints a past
Beginning the ending
Return to ash
Now that were dead my dear
We can be together
Now that were dead my dear
We can live forever
When all is pain may it be
Its all weve ever known
When flame consumes may it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won may it be
Its you Im madly fighting for
When kingdom comes may it be
We walk right through that open door
All sinners a future
All saints a past
Beginning the ending
Return to ash
Now that were dead my dear
We can be together
Now that were dead my dear
We can live forever
All sinners a future
All saints a past
Beginning the ending
Return to ash
Now that were dead my dear
We can be together
Now that were dead my dear
We can live we can live forever
Return to ashes shed this skin
Beyond the black we rise again
We shall live forever
