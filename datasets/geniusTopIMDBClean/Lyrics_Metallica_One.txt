I cant remember anything
Cant tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
Im waking up I cannot see
That theres not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God wake me
Back in the womb its much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But cant look forward to reveal
Look to the time when Ill live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God wake me
Now the world is gone Im just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God help me
Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see absolute horror
I cannot live I cannot die
Trapped in myself body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech taken my hearing
Taken my arms taken my legs
Taken my soul left me with life in Hell
