Guilty as charged but dammit it aint right
Theres someone else controlling me
Death in the air strapped in the electric chair
This cant be happening to me
Who made you God to say
Ill take your life from you
Flash before my eyes
Now its time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
Its the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here
Flash before my eyes
Now its time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Someone help me
Oh please God help me
Theyre trying to take it all away
I dont want to die
Someone help me
Oh please God help me
Theyre trying to take it all away
I dont want to die


Time moving slow the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain all I see
How true is this Just get it over with
If this is true just let it be
Wakened by a horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream
Flash before my eyes
Now its time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
