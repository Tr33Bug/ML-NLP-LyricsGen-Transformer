Alright
Were scanning the scene in the city tonight
Were looking for you to start up a fight
Theres an evil feeling in our brains
But its nothing new you know it drives us insane
Running on our way hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running on our way hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy
There is no escape and thats for sure
This is the end we wont take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
Youve always been taking and now youre giving
Running on our way hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running on our way hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy


Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it wont go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Dont try running away cause youre the one we will find
Running on our way hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running on our way hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy
Searching seek and destroy aha ha ha ha
