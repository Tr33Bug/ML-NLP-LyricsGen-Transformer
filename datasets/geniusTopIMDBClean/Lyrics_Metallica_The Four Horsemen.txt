By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
Its time to wield the blade
For now youve got some company
The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
Theyve come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Aw yeah yeah
Youve been dying since the day you were born
You know its all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
Theyve come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Aw yeah yeah
Time Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence For what youve had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death Deliverance for you for sure
Now theres nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Nows the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
Theyve come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Aw yeah yeah
