Pride you took pride you feel
Pride that you felt when youd kneel
Not the word not the love
Not what you thought from above
It feeds  It feeds 
It grows  It grows 
It clouds all you will know
Deceit deceive
Decide just what you believe
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries

The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Find your peace find your say
Find the smooth road on your way
Trust you gave a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave
It feeds  It feeds
