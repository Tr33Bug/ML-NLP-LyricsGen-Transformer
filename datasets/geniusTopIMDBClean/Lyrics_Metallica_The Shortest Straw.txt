Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes disgrace
Defying commonplace
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination why
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
Youre living Catch22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal


Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw 
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
Pulled for you  Shortest straw 
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you hands are tied
Your being ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
Youre reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
