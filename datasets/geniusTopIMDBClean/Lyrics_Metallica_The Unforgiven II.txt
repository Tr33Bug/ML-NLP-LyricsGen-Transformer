Lay beside me and tell me what theyve done
And speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now but its open if youre true
If you can understand the me then I can understand the you
Lay beside me under wicked sky
Through black of day dark of night we share this paralyze
The door cracks open but theres no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still but theres no sun shining through
No theres no sun shining through
No theres no sun shining
What Ive felt what Ive known
Turn the pages turn the stone
Behind the door should I open it for you Yeah
What Ive felt what Ive known
Sick and tired I stand alone
Could you be there Cause Im the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too
Come lay beside me this wont hurt I swear
She loves me not she loves me still but shell never love again
She lay beside me but shell be there when Im gone
Black heart scarring darker still yes shell be there when Im gone
Yes shell be there when Im gone
Dead sure shell be there
What Ive felt what Ive known
Turn the pages turn the stone
Behind the door should I open it for you Yeah
What Ive felt what Ive known
Sick and tired I stand alone
Could you be there Cause Im the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too


Lay beside me tell me what Ive done
The door is closed so are your eyes
But now I see the sun now I see the sun
Yes now I see it
What Ive felt what Ive known
Turn the pages turn the stone
Behind the door should I open it for you Yeah
What Ive felt what Ive known
So sick and tired I stand alone
Could you be there Cause Im the one who waits
The one who waits for you oh
What Ive felt what Ive known
Turn the pages turn the stone
Behind the door should I open it for you  So I dub thee Unforgiven 
What Ive felt
Oh what Ive known
I take this key  Never free  and I bury it  Never me  in you
Because youre unforgiven too
Never free never me
Because youre unforgiven too
Oh oh oh
