How could he know this new dawns light
Would change his life forever
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming
Been afraid always afraid
Of the things hes feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
You would just sail on
How can I be lost
If Ive got nowhere to go
Searched for seas of gold
How come its got so cold
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When its me I cant forgive
These days drift on inside a fog
Its thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
Hes run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast down with the ship
Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
Theyve all gone away
Theyve gone away
How can I be lost
If Ive got nowhere to go
Searched for seas of gold
How come its got so cold
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When its me I cant forgive
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me why cant I forgive me
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawns light
Would change his life forever
How can I be lost
If Ive got nowhere to go
Searched for seas of gold
How come its got so cold
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you
When its me I cant forgive
