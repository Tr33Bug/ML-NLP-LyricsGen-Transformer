New blood joins this Earth and quickly hes subdued
Through constant pained disgrace the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts the young man struggles on and on hes known
Ooh a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will theyll take away yeah
What Ive felt what Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never be never see
Wont see what might have been
What Ive felt what Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never free never me
So I dub thee Unforgiven
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
He tries to please them all this bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same hes battled constantly
This fight he cannot win a tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me yeah
What Ive felt what Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never be never see
Wont see what might have been
What Ive felt what Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never free never me
So I dub thee Unforgiven
What Ive felt what Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never be never see
Wont see what might have been
What Ive felt what Ive known
Never shined through in what Ive shown
Never free never me
So I dub thee Unforgiven whoa
