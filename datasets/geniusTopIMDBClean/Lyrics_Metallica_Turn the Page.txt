On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and theres nothing much to do
You dont feel much like riding you just wish the trip was through
But here I am on the road again
There I am up on the stage
There I go playing the star again
There I go turn the page
So you walk into this restaurant strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you as youre shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesnt bother you but you just want to explode
And most times you cant hear them talk other times you can
All the same old cliches is it woman Is it man
And you always seem outnumbered you dont dare make a stand make your stand
But here I am on the road again
There I am up on the stage
Here I go playing the star again
There I go turn the page
Out there in the spotlight youre a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head
You smoke the days last cigarette remembering what she said
What she said
Yeah
Yeah
But here I am on the road again
There I am up on the stage
Here I go playing the star again
There I go turn the page
There I go turn that page
There I go yeah there I go yeah
There I go yeah here I go
There I go there I go
And Im gone
