Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open and pour me out
Theres things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays
So tear me open but beware
Theres things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until Im clean
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me  yeah 
It hates you so hold me  yeah 
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps  Until it sleeps 
Until it sleeps
So tell me why youve chosen me
Dont want your grip dont want your greed
Dont want it
Ill tear me open make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps
It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me  yeah 
It holds you
Holds you holds you
Until it sleeps  Until it sleeps 
Until it sleeps  Until it sleeps until it sleeps 


I dont want it I dont want it
Want it want it want it want it no woahwoah
So tear me open but beware
Theres things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me til Im clean
Ill tear me open make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps until it sleeps
Until it sleeps until it sleeps
