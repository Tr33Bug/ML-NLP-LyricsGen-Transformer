Welcome Home  Sanitarium  Lyrics
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Cant they see its why my brain says rage
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone
Build my fear of whats out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that Im insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied it makes him well
Hes getting better cant you tell
No more can they keep us in
Listen damn it we will win
They see it right they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone


Sanitarium
Just leave me alone 
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill its such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again
