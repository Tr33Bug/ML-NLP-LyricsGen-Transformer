And the road becomes my bride 
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Roamer wanderer nomad vagabond
Call me what you will yeah
Oh but Ill take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And Ill redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home yeah
And the Earth becomes my throne 
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars Ive grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover wanderer nomad vagabond
Call me what you will
Yeah you will


But Ill take my time anywhere
Im free to speak my mind anywhere
And Ill never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home yeahyeah
But Ill take my time anywhere
Im free to speak my mind
And Ill take my time anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home thats right
But Ill take my time anywhere
Im free to speak my mind anywhere
And Ill redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lies but still I roam yeahyeah
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam yeah
Wherever I may wander wander wander
Wherever I may roam
Yeahyeah wherever I may roam
Yeahyeah wherever I may roam
