Late at night all systems go youve come to see the show
We do our best youre the rest you make it real you know
Theres a feeling deep inside that drives you fucking mad
A feeling of a hammerhead you need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
Youre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring make it bleed make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around its hot as hell tonight
Adrenaline starts to flow
Youre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Here on stage the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass kicks your face exploding feeling nears
Nows the time to let it rip to let it fucking loose
Were gathered here to maim and kill cause this is what we choose
Adrenaline starts to flow
Youre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Here we go
Whiplash
The show is through the metals gone its time to hit the road
Another town another gig again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways life out here is raw
But well never stop well never quit cause were Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
Youre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whoa whoa
