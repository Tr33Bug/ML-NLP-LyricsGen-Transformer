Whiskey in the Jar Lyrics
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil, he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me, no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-ah, whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah

Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear cannon ball a roaring
Me? I like sleeping specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah
