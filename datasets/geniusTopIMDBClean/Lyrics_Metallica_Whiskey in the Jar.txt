As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take you
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money yeah and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she would love me no never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman yeah for you know she tricked me easy
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddyo
Whack for my daddyo
Theres whiskey in the jaro
Being drunk and weary I went to Mollys chamber
Taking money with me but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels yeah
