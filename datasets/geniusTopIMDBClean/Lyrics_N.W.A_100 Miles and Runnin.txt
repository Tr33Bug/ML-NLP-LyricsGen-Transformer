Catch those motherfuckers catch them catch them
Hey man keep up keep up this way come on man hurry up
You dont really think youre gonna get away do you
We havent spotted them yet But theyre somewhere in the immediate vicinity
A 100 miles and runnin   MC Ren I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and its done in
Since Im stereotyped to kill and destruct 
Is one of the main reasons I dont give a fuck
Chances are usually not good
Cause Im frisked with my hands on a hot hood
And gettin jacked by the youknowwho
When in a black and white the capacity is two
Were not alone were three more brothers I mean streetbrothers
Not wearing medallions cause were not stupid mutherfuckers
Theyre out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Point blank they can kiss my black ass
I didnt stutter when I said Fuck Tha Police
Cause its hard for a nigga to get peace
Now its broken and cant be fixed
Cause police and little black niggas dont mix so
Now Im creepin through the fall
Runnin like a G well see I might have slayed yall
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin
In todays news Four fugitives are on the run
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their home base Compton
Lend me a mutherfuckin ear
So I can tell you why
Runnin with my brothers headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just reads race
The road ahead goes on and on
The shit is gettin longer than the mutherfuckin marathon
Runnin on but never runnin out
Stayin wired and if I get tired I can still try out
Hitchhikin if thats what it gotta do
But nobodys pickin up a Nigga Witta Attitude
Confused yo but Dres a nigga with nuthin to lose
One of the few whos been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin young minds
But you dont know shit til you been in my shoes
And Dre is back from the CPT
Droppin some shit thats DOPE
So fuck the POLICE
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Stuck and runnin hard hauling ass
Cause I been a nigga known for havin a notorious past
My mind was slick  my temper was too quick
Now the FBIs all over my dick
Got the stick and runnin just to find the gun that started the clock
Thats when the E jumped off the startin block
A 100 miles from home and yo its a long stretch
A little sprintin mutherfucker that they wont catch
Yeah back to Compton again
Yo its either that or the Federal pen
Cause niggas been runnin since beginning of time
Takin a minute to tell you whats on my mutherfuckin mind
Runnin like I just dont care
Comptons 50 miles but yo Imma get there
Archin my back and on a straight route
Just like Carl Lewis Im ballin the fuck out
From city to city Im a menace as I pass by
Rippin up shit just so you can remember Im
A straight up nigga thats done in gunnin and comin
Straight at yo ass a 100 miles and runnin
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
Youre almost there but the FBI has a little message for you
Nowhere to run to baby Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers
Runnin like a nigga I hate to lose
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I know it was a setup  So now Im gonna get up
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But Ive got 10 000 niggas strong
They got everybody singin my Fuck Tha Police song
And while they treat my group like dirt
Their whole fuckin family is wearin our Tshirts
So Imma run til I cant run no more
Cause its time for MC Ren to settle the score
I got a urge to kick down doors
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin
Dicktricklin at the sunny mutherfuckers are ridin
Started with five and yo one couldnt take it
So now theres four cause the fifth couldnt make it
The numbers even  now Im leavin
Were never gettin took by a bitch with a weave in
Her and the troops are right behind me
But theyre so fuckin stupid theyll never find me
One more mile to go through the dark streets
Runnin like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
But you know I never stumble or lag last
Im almost home so I better haul ass
Tearin up everything in sight
Its a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
Now that chase the shit is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin
Stop Stop Stop Stop Surprise niggas
