8 Ball  Remix  Lyrics
Kick that shit
scratched City of Compton
scratched City of Compton echoes
Cold kickin ass scratch cold kickin ass scratch
Cold kickin ass scratch Kick that shit
Pull up a chair echoes
I dont drink brass monkey like the beat funky
Nickname EazyE yo 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kickin to show my shit
Rappin holdin my dick boy I dont quit
Crowd rockin motherfucker from around the way
I got a sixshooter yo mean hombre
Rollin through the hood to find the boys
To kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and its freezin my balls
I hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself They can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gayes greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whompin
Cruisin through the Eastside south of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
I was Cold kickin ass
I was Raised in LA
I was Cruisin down the street in my sixfo
Too much posse
Ridin on Slauson lookin for Crenshaw
Turned down the sound to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tilt cause I was drunk
See a sissyass punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause its like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall
And we puttin it on wax
Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall Fuck it up yall
YEAH guitar riff


Olde English 800 cause thats my brand
Take it in a bottle 40 quart or can
Drink it like a madman yes I do
Fuck the police and a 5O too
Stepped in the party I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said Eric yo breath smells
40 ounce in hand thats what I got
Yo man you see Eazy hurling in the parkin lot
Stepped on your foot cold dissed yo ho
Asked her to dance and she said  Hell no 
Called her a bitch cause thats the rule
Bitch who you callin a bitch 
Boys in the hood tryin to keep me cool
You tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get em up
I start droppin the dogs and watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum got knocked out cold
Made you look sick you snottynosed prick
Now your fly bitch is all over his dick
Punk got dropped cause the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
Stomp a mudhole in your ass
Stomp a mudhole in your ass BITCH
Pass the brew motherfucker while I tear shit up
And yall listen up close to roll call
EazyEs in the place I got money and juice
RonDeVu with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so goddamn funky
Do the Olde 8 fuck the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
Hail to the niggas from CIA
Krazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams so fuck respect
Make a toast punkypunk to the title Im holdin
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rollin
scratched City of Compton
scratched City of Compton echoes
scratched City of Compton scratched to end
