Kick that shit 
Cold kicking ass 
Cold kicking ass
Cold kicking ass
Funky fresh EazyE 
Pull up a chair and Ima tear shit up 
I dont drink brass monkey like the beat funky
Nickname EazyE yo 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kicking to show my shit
Rapper holdin my dick boy I dont quit
And if aint rap then you know its crap
Crowd rocking sucka stomper from around the way
I got a sixshooter yo mean hombre
E rolling out to find the Boyz
To kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my tail I dont like jail
40 ounce in my lap and and its cold as hell
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself they can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the eight in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gayes Greatest Hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the Eastside South of Compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at her face and the bitch was to the curb
But she was on my tip for the title Im holding
EazyEs getting busy got the 8ball rolling
I wascold kicking ass
I wasraised in LA
I wascruising down the street in my sixfour
Too much posse
Riding on Slausson looking for Crenshaw
Turned down the sounds to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and  had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tip cause I was drunk
See a sissy ass punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause its like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title Im holding
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 Ball rolling
Fuck it up yall
Fuck it up yall
Fuck it up yall
Fuck it up yall
Fuck it up yall
Fuck it up yall
Yeah
Olde English 800 because thats my brand
Take it in a bottle forty quart or can
Drink it like a madman yes I do
Fuck the police and a 502
Stepped in the party I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said Eric yo breath smells
40 ounce in hand thats what I got
Yo man you see Eazy hurling in the parking lot
Stepped on your foot cold dissed your ho
Asked her to dance and she said Hell no
Called her a bitch because thats the rule
Boyznthe hood trying to keep me cool
Tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get em up
I started dropping the dogs and watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum got knocked out cold
Make you look sick you snotty nosed prick
Now your fly bitches all over his dick
Punk got dropped cause the title Im holding
EazyEs fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Yo pass the brew Ren while I tear shit up
And yall listen up close to roll call
EazyEs in the place I got money and juice
RonDeVus with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so funk funk funky
Do the Olde 8 forget the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
Hail to the niggas from CIA
Krazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams so fuck respect
Make a toast all you punk to the title Im holding
EazyEs breaking out and got the 8ball rolling
Man Im outta here
Yo Eazy you forgot to tell em what city you chill in
In the city  city of Compton 
In the city  city of Compton 
City City City of Compton
City City City of Compton
