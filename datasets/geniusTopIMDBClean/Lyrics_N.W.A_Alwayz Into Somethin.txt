NWA back in this mothafucker yo
Takin out all you commercializedass niggas
And were on this laid back track
And were doin this one kinda smooth
So whatcha gonna do Dre  Kick it
And so on let the shit flow on
Because I need somethin to go off on
The mothafuckin DRE servin a death wish
So Imma hit you like this
Early in the morning hop into the Benz
I got 44 ways of gettin paid
Sittin in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To scoop up Ren I heard shots
1 2 3 then I seen a nigga
Hoppin the fence and it was Ren on the mothafuckin trigger
He got in the Benz and said
Dre I was speakin to yo bitch OShea
And as we roll on I seen the patroller creep
So we got ghost before they peeped
Me and Ren in a black CE yo
Bumpin some funky shit by the DOC
I gotta get paid paid in a hurry see
I got a have it if Im not paid thoroughly
I start takin makin sure my shit is steady bumpin
A nigga always into somethin
Babababa Fuck the mothafuckin police cause they push that black man down and they kick him in his mothafuckin balls Goddamn police fuck them Come down MC Ren
I heard a dope beat somebody told me that Buck did it
But if Dre didnt do it I cant fuck with it
NWA is like a mix a fix a trix
Real niggas with big dicks
Youre takin a chance when you think that
Talkin under your breath wont lead to young death
Fuckin up shit aint shit but a killin
For a nigga labeled as bein a mothafuckin villain
But you dont know me a record cant tell ya
How so many prayed Id be a mothafuckin failure
Real niggas gotta have top rankin
I hooked up with three more niggas and started makin
Funkyass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you dont want a confrontation
Real niggas dont play
Yella Eazy me and the nigga nigga Dre
Yo always makin sure that my shit is steady bumpin
A nigga always into somethin
Boomboom Look at that bitch walking down the mothafuckin street
Now she know the Admiral wanna hold my dick in
Because that bitchs booty is so nananananananasty
Yeah the worlds most dangerous group
Definitely in this mothafucka
Sendin a shoutout to all the bitches out there
Yo you can get the pick up to suck a dick up til you hiccup
You know what Im sayin
Yo cause Im a nigga for life
And I really dont give a fuck
Im goin for mine every time
I see a fuckin softy punk strong as coffee
A nigga like that best to back up off me
Yo cause these are the days and the times of the real niggas
False niggas end up as tossed niggas
And thats on the real cause Im a nigga that kills
Again and again so tell em whats up Ren
If Im not into nothin I dont feel right
So I grab the nine and the clip and go and murder mothafuckas at night
Because Im startin to fiend from sittin in a cell
Where the crime was too tragic I couldnt make bail
So now they gotta hold me
And listen to rehabilitation over and over sayin they told me
But I dont give a fuck cuz I know my shit is pumpin
A nigga always into somethin
1991 and NWA get the job done
