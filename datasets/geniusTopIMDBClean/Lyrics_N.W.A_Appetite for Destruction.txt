I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the Drop
Cause her son caught the slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straightup man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga to run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack the fact
And take that shit back
Cause they dont wanna fuck with that
Theres too many niggas theyre trying to calm
If motherfuckers could get it nobody wouldve fucked with it
Appetite for Destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
Murder in the first degree and manslaughter
Taking the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked up
And the niggas is killing its straight fucked up
Whoever saying what Im sayings for greed
Then I aint even what theyre trying to feed
My appetite for destruction
You guys know who Im talking to
The appetite is tremendous so Im gonna spin this
Drop up some violence cause they asked me to end this
Some trouble that I caught cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
He took a swing for my head thought I was faded
Started running for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the nine went Bang
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
Cause Im a nigga you cant sleep on
So set the alarm cause I hit like a motherfucking bomb
I do damage with the nine in my hand
But the average nigga that dont know me dont understand
Im from the streets so therefore
You know I dont care for a sucker that aint down
With the real niggas the niggas the niggas
Yo and thats the way shit gotta go aint even sober
Any time that the nine wanna leave
I got a 38 hidden up the sleeve
And its ready to go to war cause thats what its here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And thats the million and one they couldnt hang with the appetite cause they wasnt rapping right
So I had to destroy whoever was standing in my presence
For fucking up the essence
Appetite for Destruction
Cops put a hurting on your ass man
You know they really degrade you
White folks dont believe that shit
They dont believe that cops degrade you
Oh come on those people those people are resisting arrest
Check it out yall in the house yall
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So wont you ease on down to the yellow brick road
To Compton but first let me tell you something
I possess the Ten Commandments of the hiphop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer
First One Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your motherfucking neck
Second One Always gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy go snap crackle and pop
Number Three Im a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryna cause some static
Number Four Heres whats in store
A crazyass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth One My killing has begun
I pull out my gun thatll keep me on the run
Step Six Hmmm its kinda tricky
Cant forget that Im motherfucking chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E
By the time you get to seven youll be six feet deep
Number Eight Make no mistake
Move real sneaky and youre bound to catch your prey
Ninth One I gotta be raw
Fuck any brainwashing manmade law
Last but not least I must be real
Number Ten is my appetite to kill
