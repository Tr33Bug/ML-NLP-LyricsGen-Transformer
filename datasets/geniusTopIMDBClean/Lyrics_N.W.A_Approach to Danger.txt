What you want is an unexpected approach
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence
Until you have a chance to assess
The situation you are confronted
Approach to danger dont move
Its hard to predict what would happen next 
Oh shit he has a gun  Drop the gun
You couldve prevented a tragedy
You can approach but the danger light is blinkin
A selfdesctruct button is activated when Im thinkin
This is a tribulation the weak is judged
The prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge
I took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme
Theyre seein doubles of me but it wasnt a dream
One vision was of life the other was death
And life didnt give a fuck if death took your last breath
So you burn in my pit that I call hell
Where you got sent because your shit dont sell
My twentytwenty was blurry from the smoke
Of the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didnt choke
I started doing them I kept on doing them two of them
Shoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
But fuck it they can approach to the danger
If you can be seen you can be hit
If you can be hit you can be killed
Hes over there Shoot him 
Fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangler
Out run the shot of a gun when the games up
Murder in the first degree but its worse to be
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
With everybody thinkin of death
I kept workin to be one of the last niggas left
So many people lookin for hope they broke
Without checkin the fingerprints on a motherfuckers throat
A heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me
So figure to see the DEAD
Bodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary
So its very necessary to carry
Ammunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution
Before Dre goes off
And starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the
Anger for the real nigga when I approach to danger
Approach the motherfuckin danger
Come back to hell and see me some time 
This is it yall 
Final approach to danger death destruction around every corner
Another dead body and you wanna keep runnin
But even the rain turns black
All you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight
No prison nobody makes bail
Everybody gotta go but see it aint no jail
Think about death takin your last breath
Heart beatin like a motherfucker like it aint no time left
With so many ways to stay up I gotta get mine
Even though they wanna make a crime yo
Of bein real a federal letter in the beginnin
Because of the release of Fuck the Police
Fuck it I approach the danger
Cause I dont give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
Cause in the long run  we all die
