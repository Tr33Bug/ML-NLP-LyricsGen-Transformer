BoyzNTheHood  remix  LyricsCruisin down the street in my 64
Jockin the bitches slappin the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
Its all about makin that GTA
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin shit
Donald B in the place to give me the pace
He said My man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Til I caught him in my car tryin to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulls out a deucedeuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge
One sucker dead LA Times front page
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin shit
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellows out there makin that dollar
I pulled up in my 64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin
And from the 8ball my breath start stinkin
Love to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb h says somethin that made me mad
She said somethin that I couldnt believe
So I grabbed the stupid  by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin  wouldnt you know
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the h
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a rightcross cold knocked him out
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin 
Im rollin hard now Im under control
Then wrapped my 64 round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another
Walkin home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a u they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resistin arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess
Now G is caught for doin the crime
Fourth offense on the boy hell do some time
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin 
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the County Jail
Two days later in Municipal Court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court said the judge
On a sixyear sentence my man didnt budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire then came Suzy
The  came in with a submachine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didnt hurt her
Both up state for attempted murder
Coz the boyznthehood are always hard
You come talkin that trash well pull your card
Knowin nothin in life but to be legit
Dont quote me boy coz I aint sayin
