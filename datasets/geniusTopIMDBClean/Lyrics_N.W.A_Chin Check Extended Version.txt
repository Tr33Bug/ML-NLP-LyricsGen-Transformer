Hello 911 Help me Help me
What is your emergency
Theres someone in my house Theres some men in my house
Can you please verify your address for me
151 Shenandoah Shenandoah
Maam where inside the house are you
Oh My God

Shotgun shell chambered Followed by gunshot

If it wadnt for me where the fuck youd be
Rappin like the Treacherous Three fuckin cowards
Id have seen Dre rockin parties for hours
And Id have seen Ren fuckin bitches from Howard
And Id have seen Snoop give away Eddie Bauers
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers
This the shit niggas kill for
They hear the Villain niggas spittin with them nigga flows
Fuck you hoes fuck you bitch ass niggas too
Got something for your throat
These niggas wearin skirts like the pope
Who them niggas that you love to get  us 
Who them niggas that you fuckin wit  us

The saga continues with the worlds most dangerous group
Four deep in the coup

Cause Imma nigga 4 life so Imma motherfuckin nigga til I dizie
A pencil a pen or a Glock
Im the original subliminal subterranium
Titianium criminal minded swift
DRE with that fuck a bitch shit  fuck a biatch 
A couple o notes and get you hogtied in rope
Dope like tons of coke cutthroat
You dont want the pistols to whistle
Candy paint Impala

God damn hoes here we go again
Fuckin with Ren playin to win
he got the  coke in hand  I got the  juice and gin
Same shit you was fuckin wit way back then
We keep it crackin from the actin to the jackin
Ged up Ced up motherfucker blaze the weed up
We all on deck fool so put your heat up
I stay on deck so me dont get wet
Look my nigga we can scatter like buckshots
Lets get together make a record why the fuck not
Why the fuck not

Why the fuck not
Cause Im tight as the night
I had to wipe activator off the mic in 1985
N N dup dup dup double u a a a a 
Real niggas biatch you know ha hah
We cause tragedy erratically
Systematically in your house without a key
How fucked up thatd be
Gatll be near your anatomy my form of flattery
Assault and battery cus we coming with that street mentality
Straight west coast rider academy
Concrete nigga thats my reality
We tend to bus on niggas that get mad at me
Was it a bitch in the mix
Well it had to be
Lying tricks told them dicks I had a key
Hoes make the world harder than it have to be
Yea thats right
