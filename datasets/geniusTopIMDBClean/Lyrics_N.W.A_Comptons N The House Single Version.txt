People from everywhere watching the show
Paying top dollars because they know
When were on the stage were in a muthafuckin rage

So if you punks wanna make somethin of it
Step up run up get up whats up suckers
You want some of this
Then youre a stupid muthafucka
Kickin  like the kick from a kickdrum
Yella boy on the drum gettin dumb
Programmin  a beat thats hittin
And if you listen then you know were not bullshittin
Dope  like a pound or a key  Yeah 
So just shut up and listen to me
I make a killin
I got money to the ceilin  Why 
Cause Im a muthafuckin ruthless villain
MC Ren  stomping any fool in my way
With some help from my homeboy Dre
Now my name is Dre the muthafuckin doctor
On your cassette im here to rock ya
With some help from my homeboy E
The criminal of the Ruthless posse
Fuckin it up word up is what we do
The reputation of the NWA crew
Gettin busy because were cold stompin
And were born and raised  in the streets of   Compton 
Speaking of Compton its making me sick  Why 
Everybodys talking that crazy shit
Saying they were raised in the CPT
Just as I was they try to be like me
Poppin that shit get the fuck out my face
Knowin that they never even seen the place
Claiming my city its my city they claim
Muthafucka were about to put some salt in your game
Ah yeah you know what we talkin about Ren
Ah yeah cold in effect on the one
Yo Im tired of these muthafuckas running around town
Talking about theyre from Compton and shit
Trying to get on the bandwagon
Yo its them stupid muthafuckas with the wack records man
Yeah you know what im talkin bout let me tell you what were talking abnout right about now kick that shit
What do you call a crew that can rap like that
Yo NWA call them muthafuckas wack
Yeah you know what time it is listen to why we call them wack
They got a wacky wack record with a wacky wack crew
Yo what about the lyrics

With a fucked up style and a fucked up show
Ayo Ren what about the scratching is it def
Fuck no

Comptons in the house
