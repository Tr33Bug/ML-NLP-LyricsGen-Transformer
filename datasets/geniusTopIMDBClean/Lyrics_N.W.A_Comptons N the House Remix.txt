From everywhere watching the show
Paying top dollars because they know
When were on the stage were in a muthafuckin rage
So Dre

Why dont you get the 12 gauge
Yeah
And show em how EazyDuzIt
So if you punks wanna make somethin of it
Step up run up get up whats up suckers
You want some of this
Then youre a stupid muthafucka
Kickin  like the kick from a kickdrum
Yella boy on the drum gettin dumb
Programmin  a beat thats hittin
And if you listen then you know were not bullshittin
Dope  like a pound or a key  Yeah 
So shut the fuck up and listen to me
I make a killin
I got money to the ceilin  Whys that 
Cause Im a muthafuckin ruthless villain
MC Ren  stomping any fool in my way
With some help from my homeboy Dre
Now my name is Dre the muthafuckin doctor
Rippin shit up oh yeah and here to rock ya
With some help from my homeboy E
The criminal of the Ruthless posse
Fuckin it up word up is what we do
The reputation of the NWA crew
Gettin busy because were cold stompin
And were born and raised
And were born and raised
And were born and raised in Compton
Speaking of Compton its making me sick  Why 
Everybodys talking that crazy shit
Saying they were raised in the CPT  Uhhuh 
Just as I was they try to be like me
Poppin that shit get the fuck out my face
Knowin that they never even seen the place
Claiming my city its my city they claim
Muthafucka were about to put some salt in your game
Yeah Im tired of these muthafuckas running around town
Talking about theyre from Compton and shit
Trying to get on the bandwagon
Yeah Dre I know what youre saying man
But lets tell them who were talking about on the one
What do you call a crew that can rap like that
Yo NWA call them muthafuckas wack
Yeah you know what time it is listen to why we call them wack
They got a wacky wack record with a wacky wack crew
Yo what about the lyrics
That shits wacky wack too
With a fucked up style and a fucked up show
Ayo Ren what about the scratching is it def
Fuck no
The muthafuckin record is so muthafuckin wack
The muthafuckin Cracker Jack needs to step the fuck back
Do you want some of this
Hell no he replied 
Dre the muthafuckin doctor
Well for the record its Ren and for the street its Villain
Dre the muthafuckin doctor
Well for the record its Ren and for the street its Villain
Yella boy why dont you kick me one of them funkyass beats
My boy my boy my boy Ice Cube
Yo we got my homeboy EazyE in the house
Wont you tell em what your name is
MC Ren is the muthafucking coroner  yeah 
Im getting rid of muthafuckas as if they was a foreigner
Show no grief to pretend when I sin
I punch you can block it but Ima still get in
This aint a TKO in the first
But its some shit from a nigga in black and much worse
Than a beating from Tyson cause Ren is not nice and
Your ass is better off just rolling a dice and
Finding you a number for luck
Cause you will need it when you see I dont give a fuck
My identity and the shit is getting shown
Without a video Im still getting known  yeah 
Im at a show then my picture is taken
One click of the flash and punk niggas are breakin
To the door tryin to join my fan club
Lipsyncin over one of my dubs
An instrumental will scratch for the moment
Until I fuck up the so called opponent
Thats standing in the zone of the twilight
Saying How in the fuck did he get mixed up in my fight
It wasnt a mistake it was a setup
So until Im finished pumpin my lyrics you should shut up
And dont attempt to speak
Because its bad enough youre rollin up shit creek
With a nigga like Ren about the hit
Now let me hear you muthafuckas talk some more shit
Or Ima bust your ass in the mouth
Yo unless youre saying Comptons in the house
Who really cares  about a sucker on a take off
Bust a move we can have a shake and bakeoff
Me and you can go cause I dont care
Yo rap fight or guerrilla warfare
We can rumble cause when my lungs go in and out
I kick rhymes in a bundle to win a bout
Or scurry or scuffle
I just muffle the opposition theres no competition
Let em know that Dre is getting stronger
Comptons in the house but now its some longer
I wont get setup shut up Im kinda fed up
You can say uncle and I still wont let up
Cause Dre is the muthafuckin doctor
And if me and Rens on the mic its like propaganda no doubt
Boy you shouldve known by now
Comptons in the house 
Yeah its time to put Compton on the map
So dont ever think you can get it none you stupid muthafuckas
Comptons in the house
