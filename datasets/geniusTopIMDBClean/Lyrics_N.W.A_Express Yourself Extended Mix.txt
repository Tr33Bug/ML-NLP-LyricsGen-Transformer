Express Yourself  Extended Mix  Lyrics
Dr Dre Yo man theres alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality
Ice Cube Yo Dre youve been doin all this dope producin you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
Dr Dre So watch do you want me to do
All you got to do now express yourself
Im expressin with my full capabilities
Now Im livin in correctional facilities
Cause some dont agree with how I do this
I get straight meditate like a Buddhist
Im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think
Some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
Cause they dont flow like this one
You know what I wont hesitate to dis one or two before Im through
So dont try to sing this
Some drop science well Im droppin English
Even if Yella makes it acapella
I still express yo I dont smoke weed or sess
Cause its known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin
But makin a sucker and you equal
Dont be another sequel
Express yourself
Do it good
Express yourself
Oh do it
Ice Cube is not for the pop charts
So where should a brother like you start expressin yourself
My boyll show you how
Yo Dre   What up  Drop English right about
Now gettin back to the PG
Thats program and its easy
Dre is back  New jacks are made hollow
Expressin aint their subject because they like to follow the words
The style the trend the records I spin
Again and again and again
Yo ya on the other end
Watch a brother playin dope rhymes with no help
Theres no fessin and guessin while Im expressin myself
Its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be
But not me
Ruthless is the way to go they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hiphop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
And those musicians curse at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah they want reality but you wont hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go lookin for the dope man
Oh they ban my group from the radio
Hear NWA and say Hell no
But you know it aint all about wealth
As long as you make a note to
express yourself 


Express yourself
Do it do
Express yourself
Oh do it
A lyricist yo Dre is the name for it
To make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for
Kickin reality yo but staying hisself
But its important to keep it in mind to  Express yourself 
From the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then
Expression is big part of it
You aint efficient when you flow you aint swift
Movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis
Theres a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson all of them expression
And if you start fessin I got a SmithWesson for ya
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the Summer Winter Spring and Autumn
Its Dre on the mic gettin physical
Doin the job NWA is the lynch mob
Yes Im macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin just like a fetus
Or a tumor but heres the rumour Dres in the neighborhood and hes up to no good
When I start expressin myself Yella slam it
Cause if I stay funky like this Im doin damage
Or Imma be too hyped I need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So when you see Dre a DJ on the mic
Ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight
Cause if I strike It aint for your good health
But I wont strike if you just
express yourself 
Express Yourself
Do it good
Express Yourself
Oh do it
