Yo man its a lot of brothers out there flakin and perpetratin
But scared to kick reality
Man youve been doin all this dope producin
You aint had a chance to show em what time it is
So what you want me to do  Express yourself 
Im expressin with my full capabilities
And now Im livin in correctional facilities
Cause some dont agree with how I do this
I get straight meditate like a Buddhist
Im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and thatll make you think
Some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach
Cause they dont flow like this one
You know what
I wont hesitate to diss one or two before Im through
So dont try to sing this
Some drop science well Im droppin English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express yo I dont smoke weed or sess
Cause its known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin
But makin a sucka and you equal dont be another sequel
Express yourself  Ah ah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah 
Express yourself  Smoke smoke 
Come on and do it  Yeah kick it over here 
Express yourself  Do it do it  
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Now gettin back to the PG
Thats program and its easy
Dre is back new jacks are made hollow
Expressin aint their subject because they like to follow
The words the style the trend the records I spin
Again and again and again  yo you on the other end
Watch a brother sayin dope rhymes with no help
Theres no fessin and guessin while Im expressin myself
Its crazy to see people be
What society wants em to be but not me
Ruthless is the way to go they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hiphop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah they want reality but you wont hear none
Theyd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go lookin for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear NWA and say Hell no
But you know it aint all about wealth
As long as you make a note to
Express yourself  Yeah yeah yeah  
Express yourself
Come on and do it  Yeah yeah do it 
Express yourself  Dr Dre Dr Dre in full effect and NWA 
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Express yourself
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You aint efficient when you flow
You aint swift movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis
Theres a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson all of em expression
And if you start fessin I got a Smith  Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
Its Dre on the mic gettin physical
Doin the job NWA is the lynch mob
Yes Im macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin just like a fetus
Or a tumor but heres the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and hes up to no good
When I start expressin myself  Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this Im doin damage
Or Imma be too hyped and need a straitjacket
I got knowledge and other suckas lack it
So when you see Dre a DJ on the mic
Ask what its like  its like we gettin hype tonight
Cause if I strike it aint for your good health
But I wont strike if you just
Express yourself
Yeah yeah this records almost over almost over gotta get hyped up 
Express yourself  Do it do it 
Come on and do it  Do it do it do it 
Express yourself  Comptons full of fakes Comptons full of fakes yeah 
Express yourself
Come on and do it  Do it do it do it 
Express yourself
Come on and do it  Thats what she said what she said 
Come on and do it
Come on and do it
