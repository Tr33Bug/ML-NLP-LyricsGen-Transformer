Right about now NWA court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of NWA versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren Ice Cube
And EazymotherfuckingE
Order order order
Ice Cube take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass
You goddamn right
Well wont you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say
Fuck the police comin straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause Im brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit cause I aint the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toetotoe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin with me cause Im a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin my car lookin for the product
Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics
Youd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin in a Benzo
Beat a police out of shape
And when Im finished bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I dont know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand without a gun they cant get none
But dont let it be a black and a white one
Cause theyll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just cause Im from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when Im finished its gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in LAÂ 
Yo Dre I got something to say


Fuck the police fuck fuck
Fuck the police fuck fuck
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police  Example of scene one 
Pull your goddamn ass over right now
Aw shit now what the fuck you pullin me over for
Cause I feel like it
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
Man fuck this shit
Alright smartass Im taking your black ass to jail
MC Ren will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever Im steppin
And the motherfuckin weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the socalled law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But theyre scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit dont work I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police Im saying Fuck you punk
Reading my rights and shit its all junk
Pulling out a silly club so you stand
With a fakeass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see whats up
And well go at it punk and Ima fuck you up
Make you think Ima kick your ass
But drop your gat and Rens gonna blast
Im sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But Ima smoke em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
Im a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin out a cop or two they cant cope with me
The motherfuckin villain thats mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So Ima turn it around
Put in my clip yo and this is the sound  Gunshots 
Yeah somethin like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren dont give a fuck to say
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police fuck the fuck
Fuck the police
Knocking
Yeah man what you need
Police open now  Aww shit 
We have a warrant for EazyEs arrest  Battering ram 
Get down and put your hands right where I can see em  Move motherfucker move now 
What the fuck did I do man What did I do
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor  You heard the man shut the fuck up 
But I didnt do shit
Man just shut the fuck up
EazyE wont you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit
Im tired of the motherfuckin jackin
Sweating my gang while Im chillin in the shack and
Shining the light in my face and for what
Maybe its because I kick so much butt
I kick ass or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when Im playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
Cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah Im a gangsta but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge what do you got
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat it dont matter if hes smaller or bigger
Size dont mean shit hes from the old school fool 
And as you all know Es here to rule
Whenever Im rollin keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue yo so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if Im rollin off the eight hell be the one
That I take out and then get away
While Im driving off laughing this is what Ill say
Fuck the police fuck the fuck the
Fuck the police fuck
Fuck the police fuck fuck
Fuck the police  The verdict 
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck white bread chicken shit motherfucker
Wait thats a lie Thats a goddamn lie
Get him out of here  I want justice 
Get him the fuck out my face  I want justice 
Out right now
Fuck you you black motherfuckers
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
