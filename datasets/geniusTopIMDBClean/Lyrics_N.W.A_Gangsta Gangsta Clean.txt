Gangsta Gangsta  Clean  Lyrics
Pull over to the side right now
Yo Dre gimme a funkyssa bassline
Heres a little somethin bout a brotha like me
Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That Im a crazy motha from around the way
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now Im the type of punk that you read about
Doin a crime or two thats what the hell I do
You dont like how Im livin well kcuf uoy
This is a crew and Im in it
My man Drell knock you out in a minute
With a right left rightleft youre toothless
And then you say Damn they ruthless
Well make you say it again  Damn 
NWAs messing up the program
And then you realize we dont care
We dont just say no were too busy sayin Yeah
About drinking straight out the eight bottle
Tell the truth do I look like a role model
To a kid looking up to me
Life aint nothin but girls and money
Cause Im the type of brotha thats built to last
We had some in the present some in the past
But I dont give a damn cause I keep bailing
Yo tell em what they yelling
Gangsta gangsta thats what they yelling
Its not about a salary its all about reality
Gangsta gangsta
Hell tell you exactly how he feel and dont want a  thing back
Homies all standing around just hangin
Some dopedealin some gangbangin
We decide to roll and we deep
See a sucka on Daytons and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my AK pointed in the window
Check it in punk or I might blast
He got scared and hit the gas
We tried to catch him but you all know
You cant catch a 50 so
We headed right back to the fort
Sweatin all the girls in the biker shorts
We didnt get no play from the ladies
With six thugs in a car are you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
We all said Kcuf uoy hctib and kept going
To the hood and we was fittin to
Look for somethin else to get into
Like a new female or in fact
A bum rush but we call it rat pack
On a sucka for nothin at all
Ice Cubell go stupid when Im full of eight ball
I might stumble but still wont lose
Now Im dressed in the county blues
Cause Im the type of brotha thats built to last
We had some in the present some in the past
But I dont give a damn cause I keep bailin
Yo tell em what they yellin


Wait a minute wait a minute cut this
Man what you gon do now
What we gonna do right here is go way back
How far you goin back Way back
As we go a little somethin like this hit it
Heres a little gangsta short in size
A tshirt and Levis is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and EazyE cold rockin it
Well Im EazyE the one they talkin about
Sucka tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll so its time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the 64
With the diamond in the back sunroof top
Diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
Cause Im the E I dont slang or bang
I just knock suckas out like it aint no thang
And all the ladies you know Im talkin to you
We love you Eazy Yeah I love you too
Because you see you know I gotta be legit
So let me tell you stupid suckas who youre messing with
Cause Im the type of brotha thats built to last
We had some in the present some in the past
But I dont really care cause I keep bailin
Yo tell em what they yellin
Gangsta gangsta thats what they yelling
Its not about a salary its all about reality
Gangsta gangsta
Hell  up you and yours and anything that gets in his way
Gangsta gangsta thats what they yelling
Its not about a salary its all about reality
Gangsta gangsta
Hell just call you a lowlife mother  and talk about your funky ways
