Hopin you sophisticated muthafuckaz hear what I have to say
When me and my posse stepped in the house
All the punkass niggas start breakin out
Cause you know they know whats up
So we started lookin for the bitches with the big butts
Like her but she keep cryin
I got a boyfriend  bitch stop lyin
Dumbass hooker aint nothin but a dyke
Suddenly I see some niggas that I dont like
Walked over to em and said Whats up
The first nigga that I saw  hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin him and so did E
By that time got rushed by security
Out the door but we dont quit
Ren said Lets start some shit
I got a shotgun and heres the plot
Takin niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom Boom Boom Yeah I was gunnin
And then you look all you see is niggas runnin
And fallin and yellin and pushin and screamin and cussin
I stepped back and I kept bustin
And then I realized its time for me to go
So I stopped jumped in the vehicle

Some dopedealin some gangbangin
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Daytons and we creep
Real slow and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin I jumped in the bucket
We couldnt catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didnt get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car  are you crazy
She was scared and it was showin
We all said Fuck you bitch and kept goin
To the hood and we was fin to
Find somethin else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
A bum rush but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin at all
Ice Cubell go stupid when Im full of eight ball
I might stumble but still wont lose
Now Im dressed in the county blues
Cause Im the type of nigga thats built to last
If you fuck with me Ill put my foot in your ass
I dont give a fuck cause I keep bailin
Yo What the fuck are they yellin
Wait a minute wait a minute cut this shit
Man whatcha gon do now
What were gonna do right here is go back

A tshirt and Levis is his only disguise
Built like a tank yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and EazyE cold runnin shit
