Ice Cube do you think you could give me some money to get my hair done
Whats wrong with your hair right now
Well you know I get it done every week and I need my nails done too
Look Imma tell you like this
I aint the one the one to get played like a pooh butt
See Im from the street so I know whats up
On these silly games thats played by the women
Im only happy when Im goin up in em
But you know Im a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to em with aggression
Listen to the kid and learn a lesson today
See they think we narrow minded
Cause they got a cute face and bigbehinded
So I walk over and say How ya doin
See Im only down for screwin but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
Cause if they catch you slipping youll get schooled
And theyll get you for your money son
Next thing you know youre getting their hair and they nails done
Fool and theyll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex they got a bad cough
Or a headache its all give and no take
Run out of money and watch your heart break
Theyll drop you like a bad habit
Cause a brother with money yo they gotta have it
Messing with me though they gets none
You cant juice Ice Cube girl cause I aint the one
Girrrrrl you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey Cause if they aint got no money they cant do nothin for me but get out of my face
I know what you mean girl it aint nothin right jumpin off unless he got dollars
Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girls number
Hes getting juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo I drive a bucket
And wont think nuttin of it
She can ride or walk either leave it or love it
I show her that Im not the O the NE say
Im a ruthless NI doubleG A
Cause Im gamin on a female thats gamin on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my dingaling but I wont bring no
Flowers to your doorstep when we goin out
Cause youll take it for granted no doubt
And after the date Imma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster Huh Im thinking Burger King
And when I take you you get frustrated
You cant juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see I dont go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin out the pocket to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl you cant play me girl
For the simple fact that I aint the one


I dont care how they look if they got money we can hook up but they aint gettin none
Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some play with they mind a lil bit and get that money Oh Ice Cube can I have some money pleeeease
Give you money Why bother
Cause you know Im looking nothing like your father
Girl I cant be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten shes giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But lets see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
Cause they fine with a big behind but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself homie
And if you got enough game
Youll get her name and her number
Without going under
You cant leave em and love and stay above em
I used to get no play now she stay behind me
Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some now she feels dumb
To my homies its funny
But thats what you get trying to play me for my money
Now dont you feel used
But I dont give a hoot huh because I knock boots
You shouldnt be so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it
Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I dont burn
You think Im a sucka but I aint the one
But you said you love me
I dont see no rings on this finger
Why you doin me like this I love you
Yeah you love my money I got what I wanted  beat it
