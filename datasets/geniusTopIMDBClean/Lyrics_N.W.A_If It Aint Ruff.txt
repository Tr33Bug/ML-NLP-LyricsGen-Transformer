Aint that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug you know
Ren is the villain and youre just an hostage
So whenever Im steppin cover your head like an ostrich
Groupies been waitin for this suckers been hatin for this
You know why Because so many are relatin to this
Jealous is how they feel it intentionally
But they start to love it because I made it eventually
Pumpin the music I keep the music like pumpin
Cause Ren aint in here for nothin I keep the average crowd jumpin
Yo you know the color the villains in black
Always down to make noise and attack
So you better get back unless you wanna come with it
And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it
Youre screamin with fear but its with fear that youre screamin
Youre wakin up in a sweat cause Ren is givin bad dreams and
Im not schemin Im just tellin the facts
Thats how it is when NWA starts to jack
So brothers that wanna scrap with me
That sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me
Especially beggin to write some lyrics with me
I just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
Cause when it comes to Ren theres no comparison
And if you try to be me its quite embarrassin
But I understand cause youre mentally slow
Cause I can tell from the jump youre too nervous to go
If it aint ruff it aint me
The gangstas black and hes about to attack
If it aint ruff it aint me
Lemme bust a freestyle there   Alright bet 
I can tell that youre afraid to fight me
Simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me
Because your sweat is a puddle but theres a puddle o sweat
Im a threat so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
And clean the dirt off your face that causes acne
Its ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me
This is the round where the punch will go
Into your HEAD thats known as a blow
Im makin a point but its a point that Im makin
Like see Im hatin the fakin I keep the suckers like shakin
Scared to speak with a thought when theyre chosen
The sound of my voice in their ear and theyre frozen
This is a battle to the death its like the same ol
Against a brother on a tip with a Kangol
Givin a pain but its with pain that Im givin
But Im comparin and tearin em but Im makin a livin
With the hype of a nine volt battery
And the odds for me to conquer is averagely good
Meanin Imma flow
Im from the streets so yo Im ready to go
If it aint ruff it aint me  Yo Ren 
The gangstas black and hes about to attack
If it aint ruff it aint me
Man whatcha gonna do now  Get funky
The do not disturb sign is in effect
While Im thinkin of a fool to select
To give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
Slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them
Tell em theyre guilty and peep out the bailer
And get a new track o drums so I can play with
Percussion pumpin it loud when I perform
Yo you wanna play in my game put on a uniform
It aint a rule in the book you have to go by
Hey cause when it comes to cheatin yo you should know I
For fear in the hearts cause its the hearts full of fear
Coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
The Hulk was incredible yo but Ren he was super
But now Im ruthless a civilian and not a trooper
But a soldier with a top rankin
Givin dope material the hell with the gankin
So play like an airplane and just jet
And keep your blood pressure low cause Im a threat if not
Im afraid of the show
That youre a sucker and youre too nervous to go
If it aint ruff it aint me  Yo Ren 
The gangstas black and hes about to attack
If it aint ruff it aint me  Yo Ren 
The gangstas black
If it aint ruff it aint me
The gangstas black and hes about to attack
If it aint ruff it aint me  Yo Ren 
The gangstas black
If it aint ruff it aint me
The gangstas black and hes about to attack
If it aint ruff it aint me  Yo Ren 
The gangstas black
If it aint ruff it aint me
