Why you brothers insist on usin the word nigga
Dont you know thats bringin down the black race
Nigga nigga nigga thats all I hear you motherfuckers talk about is nigga
You can do what you want just keep it out of my neighborhood
Personally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh
I aint no nigga fuck that shit
Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4letter word
All over this bullshit its just a bunch of fuckin noise
The way you talk about women is bullshit plain bullshit
What you motherfuckers doin for the black community anyway
Motherfucker I got kids I dont want em listenin to that bullshit
hospital monitor starts beeping
Fuck the niggas
Motherfuckers need to stop
How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it
monitor stops beeping  RIP
Flatline
Bullshit
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me
Well its because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo and say that Im no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldnt have to go out
Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
When the cops came they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore to make more
A 15yearold black kidll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now hes put to rest
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me
I guess its just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin a job was murder
Fuck flippin burgers cause I deserve a
Ninetofive I can be proud of that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of
Yo The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But Im a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin paid like a motherfucker
A young brother who dont give a fuck about another
Yeah


Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that Im rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get face down in the street
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me
Because my mouth is so motherfuckin nasty
Bitch this bitch that nigga this nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin fat
Gettin paid to say this shit here
Makin more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So why not call myself a nigga
Its better than pullin the trigger and goin up the river
And then I get called a nigga anyway
Broke as a motherfucker and locked away so
So cut out all that bullshit
Yo I guess Ill be a nigga for life
Niggas crackers jews
If theres hell below were all gonna go
Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
Im treated like a fuckin disease
You say  why do I call myself a nigga so quick
Cause I can reach in my drawers and pull out a bigger dick yo
Nigga say nigga we cool but
Cracker say nigga nigga knocked the fuck up
But I gotta be a fast nigga to never be the last nigga
Or Ill have to beat yo ass nigga
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later in a verse I curse
Because Im real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin
Murder created by the streets of Compton
Now get it from the underground poet
I live it I see it and I write it because I know it
And if you think Im fuckin your wife
Youre motherfuckin right yo cause Im a nigga for life
I love niggas I love niggas I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love that you niggas  niggas for life 
Nigga this nigga that
The actual fact is that Im black and bound to attract
The attention of another I mean the other
But Im a motherfucker thatll have em runnin for cover
You see I dont give a fuck about nothin
Except gettin paid gettin bitches and issuin stitches
Which is all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then its time to say the niggas here to stay
But what about the fake niggas the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But NWA is outta your motherfuckin range
We aint gonna change a motherfuckin thang
I call myself a nigga cause my skin wont lighten
I call myself a nigga cause the shit that Im writin
Hypes me hypes other motherfuckers around me
And thats the reason why they wanna surround me
And ask me  why do I call myself a negro
Aint none of their fuckin business cause Ill let the trigger go
So get out my presence and get out of my sight
Cause MC Ren is a nigga for life
Youre a nigga til you die
If youre a po nigga youre a po nigga
If youre a rich nigga youre a rich nigga
But you never stop bein a nigga
And if you get to be educated you just an educated nigga
I can dig it 
Its plain to see you cant change me
Cause imma be a nigga for life
Its plain to see you cant change me
Cause imma be a nigga for life
Its plain to see you cant change me
Cause imma be a nigga for life
Its plain to see you cant change me
Cause imma be a nigga for life
Its plain to see you cant change me
Cause imma be a nigga for life
Its plain to see you cant change me
Cause Imma be a nigga for life
