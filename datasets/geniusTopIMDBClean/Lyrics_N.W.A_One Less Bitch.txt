The worlds most dangerous group
Once again beating on your motherfucking eardrums
Doing much damage for all you slutty ass hoes
Yo there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was good to GO for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest she was a hooker
So I took her a hundred yards to the boulevard
I told her Ill take care of you you take care of me
Youve got a PIMP and all I want is the money
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin
Yo she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like Medusa with titties full grown
One look and your dick turns to stone yeah
Keepin in mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows Im not to be fucked with
She aint crazy
Fuckin with Dre shell be pushin up daisies
She was the perfect ho but wouldnt you know
The bitch tried to gank me so
I had to kill her
Yeah straight hittin
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo I tied her to the bed I was thinking the worst
But yo I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the fortyfo yo
Then I straight smoked the ho
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess she figured
I was soft and she paid the cost to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
Shes outta here and thats how it turns out
Now Vicky Vicky Vicky shes very tricky
She put her hickey on top of my dick sick bitch see
She told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick weekly
I said Im with it but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin that I could fold up
We can do this  she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo she wrote a check many a check
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin at the same game
All I wanted to do was get PAID
Just a little somethin for fuckin me
Yo Everything was cool but Vicky concerned me
Her husband was the District Attorney
So before he found out he was crossed up
By his bitch I was fuckin I had her tossed up
And put to sleep so a nigga never forgets
A dead bitch cant tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
Shes outta here and thats how it turned out
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about
Thinkin about money and lookin at a prostitute
The bitch was cute so now I had to execute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a steel trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin bigga
I think I had a flashback though
Cause I said fuck it
Loped and choked and smoked to the ho like this
Bitch its all about Dre
The money money money and this all I gotta say
Of course she came with me and remained with me
Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin that trick shit
Cause niggas knew that she was short one
A little later though she caught one
In the chest and I knew that it was commin
By who and how the all act would be done
So what One less bitch I gotta worry about
But that aint how it turned out
Yo there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the muthafuckin trigger and said I got her
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin her in the river with cement shoes
I knew my money was comin up short
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought shed never get caught
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with her other nigga countin my cash
I shouldve known she was like them other hoes
I told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin left but the shoes
I had up a nine so they couldnt refuse
I shot the nigga he was outta there
And tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin chair
Now theres one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out thats how it turns out
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about
In reality a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches
And all bitches are created equal
To me all bitches are the same
Moneyhungry scandalous groupie hoes
Thats always ridin on a niggas dick always in a niggas pocket
And when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind
To me ALL BITCHES AINT SHIT
One less
One less
One less bitch you gotta worry about
