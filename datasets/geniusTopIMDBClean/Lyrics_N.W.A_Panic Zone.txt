Panic Zone dont get your girl in here
A way out in here a way out in here
A way out in here a way out in here
A way out in here a way out in here
A way out in here a way out in here
Panic Zone dont get your girl in here
Panic Zone dont get your girl in here
Panic Zone dont get your girl
Its called the panic zone  the panic zone 
Thats right the panic zone
Some people call it torture
But its what we call home
We are the renegades of this territory
And youre the prey 
Im the Arabian Prince  and were NWA 
Dont interfere with the sound you here
Cause its a dangerous groove
Im in control of your mind and soul
Dont be afraid just bust a move
So far from home
Youre on your own
In the land of the unknown
Its the darkside the darkside
Its called the panic zone
Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There is nothing wrong
The underworld is taking control
Youre not only in dimension of sight and sound
But of mind
Theres a sign post up ahead and it reads
The Panic Zone
Now the party is at its peak
So we suggest you move your feet
NWA create the groove
And Dr Dre create the beat
So if you got the juice
And youre feelin loose
Let the music take your mind
The freaks are here
Dont interfere our world is one of a kind
This place is called the west
WestCoast of the USA
The Panic Zones home base
In a place we call LA
So ladies all the ladies
If youre all alone
Just call Arabian Prince
In the panic zone  papapanic zone 
A way out in here a way out in here
A way out in here a way out in here
A way out in here a way out in here
A way out in here a way out in here
