The motherfucking saga continues
All hail to those believin in the real gangsta shit
Cause when it comes to the real niggas
It makes the shit that much harder to deal with
Yeah Above The Law up in this motherfucker
Black Mafia for life
Down with the real niggas for life Ha ha
Yo Sweet Talk tell em what the fuck we here for
Well alright yall USC Compton Watts
The Woods All across the motherfuckin USA
Ye though I walk through the the valley of real niggas
I should fear no man or motherfuckin Klan hear me one
Cause I been to the mountaintops yall
And I done seen through the eyes of a real nigga
Yo what you think about the real niggas 187 
Yo they make some of the coooooooolest shit I done never heard
Yo for me KmG I must give it up
To the Ruthless motherfuckin gangsters
Fear no mob
Because youre scared mon youre scared
Dem de pussy runnin at yall scared mon
Bend dem silly bumba claat barber til de pussy claat run
BO BO BO BO BO Keep Babylon on the run seen
The real niggas is back cause theres too many bullshit records out
Niggas fiendin for what we put out
But you dont have to wait no longer
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
So many groups made three albums or more
And that weakass shit is still sittin in the record store
They wonder why it never sold
Niggas rappin since the 70s and still never went gold
Our first record sold two million copies
Thats because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
You came out street and crossed over
And after that your career is fuckin over
Because of that youre not around
So shut the fuck up and witness the sound of some real niggas
Yeah motherfuckers
Keepin all you busters on the run in 91
Kick that shit Ren
Most niggas cant understand
And never will if they aint part of the Ruthless mafia clan
Niggas is dedicated to the streets
With hype fuckin lyrics and the dopeass beats
The songs will never come soft because I come off
So dont get in my way cause motherfucker youll get cut off
And its somethin you can move your lips to
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
And let me now if you wanna ride the DICK
All day thats with no play
Cause aint no rap group out that I know
That make me wanna listen to the radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryin to make a comeback
With lovesongs and that shit is wack
And thats why your ass aint around
Cause you dont have the motherfuckin sound
Of a real nigga
YEAH MOTHERFUCKERS
