EazyE Yo Ren
MC Ren  What up
EazyE Take one
MC Ren Yo
EazyE Hit it
Ruthless plenty of that and much more
So at the party Ren is controllin the floor
That you step and do your dance routine
It aint a dream my man youre in a gangsta scene
With a villain doin damage on a 24 track
With no confusion to finish my conclusion
Rythymatic rhymes from a radio cat
You cant take what I got coz Ill be takin it right back
Ruthless gangsta  Cold killin
You wanna know what its means  Definition villain
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell its mine
With a baseball cap thats black that Im wearin
And a look that keeps you all starin
And wondering why Im invincible
But when you hear my rhyme its convincible
I dont take no shorts while Im constructing the ground
That makes yall move around to my hell of a sound
Girls drool on me like a diamond
Yo Ren tell them what they do when you start rhymin 
I go to the party I hip I hop the spot
I dunno what it is but the girls get hot
Perspirin like theyre on fire and
Their socalled boyfriends withem are retirin
And for this reason Im a walkin threat
So when Im on stage I want quiet on tha set
Light camera action  NWA take two 
Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangsta or villain in mine is in session
The way that Im referrin to this makes ya move ya butt
But dont stand in a daze yeah you should know whats up
Anyway I keep em clappin along
Cause nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
Im like Toyota who could ask for anything more
When NWA is cold rockin the floor
Like stupid actin like a retard
Waitin for a bumrush gettin to the good part
It tempts me so with temptation
Writin my lyrics with this hyped information
This is a section of my creation
So dont say shhh with an explanation
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
Boy you should have known by now  Its mine
Unpredictable keepin you extremely enjoyed
Its irresistible meaning that you cant avoid
And while Im on stage look forward to sweat
But after I rip it up I want quiet on tha set
Light camera action  NWA take three 
I can be loud as hell think I will Never
Quiet on tha set  Yeah I like that better
Cause what I can do I think I earn respect
And if I didnt from you thats what I expect
Cause if it aint ruff it aint me
So who really cares how you want me to be
See Im just mean staying at the top of the pile
And doin soft note tunes it aint my style
And this concludes our program
Of how NWA makes a ruthless jam
Now first we take an average drum
Give it to Dre and the boy gets dumb
Its no secret that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
All kinda lyrics thats promised to play
To make everybody say
They can be cold and ruthless no question about that
But sometimes its more complicated
Yo Dre 
You know what I want you to do 
Bring that beat back bring that beat back 
Now MC Ren is here working like super glue
No matter what I do Im always stickin to you
Cause Im the pusher supplying the fix
And this jams so dope it dont need a remix
But Im making obstacles of enemy traps
To catch any MCs with the weakest raps
Crucifyin in vain like just for usin my name
The definition is pain but thats the thing o the game
If they try to retreat I catchem one at a time
Cause theyre comittin a crime and still promotin a rhyme
So you in the back of me just listen and learn
Because youll all get a chance or maybe a turn
Now my assignment was to give a preview
So at my next concert I wanna see you there
Not sittin in a chair standin on both feet with yo hand in the air
Now Im about to jet out but Ill be back
But next time expect a more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
With lyrics thats smooth to start some discussion
The prove that Im hype and you know thats bet
Now continue to dance coz Im thru with tha set
