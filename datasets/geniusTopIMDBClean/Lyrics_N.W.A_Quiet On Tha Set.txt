Quiet On Tha Set Lyrics
Eazy-E: Yo Ren
MC Ren:  What up?
Eazy-E: Take one
MC Ren: Yo
Eazy-E: Hit it

Ruthless, plenty of that and much more
So at the party, Ren is controllin' the floor
That you step and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene
With a villain doin damage on a 24 track
With no confusion to finish my conclusion
Rythymatic rhymes from a radio cat
You can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back
Ruthless gangsta - Cold killin'
You wanna know what it's means? - Definition villain
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin'
And a look that keeps you all starin'
And wondering why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible
I don't take no shorts while I'm constructing the ground
That makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound
Girls drool on me like a diamond
(Yo Ren, tell them what they do when you start rhymin')
I go to the party, I hip, I hop the spot
I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot
Perspirin' like they're on fire and
Their so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin'
And for this reason I'm a walkin threat
So when I'm on stage I want quiet on tha set
"Light, camera, action" (N.W.A. take two)

Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangsta or villain in mine is in session
The way that I'm referrin' to this makes ya move ya butt
But don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up
Anyway I keep 'em clappin' along
'Cause nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
I'm like Toyota, who could ask for anything more
When N.W.A. is cold rockin' the floor
Like stupid, actin like a retard
Waitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part
It tempts me so with temptation
Writin' my lyrics with this hyped information
This is a section of my creation
So don't say shhh! with an explanation
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
(Boy you should have known by now) It's mine!
Unpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed
It's irresistible, meaning that you can't avoid
And while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat
But after I rip it up I want quiet on tha' set
"Light, camera, action" (N.W.A. take three)
You might also like
I can be loud as hell, think I will? Never
Quiet on tha' set - Yeah I like that better
Cause what I can do I think I earn respect
And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect
'Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't me
So who really cares how you want me to be
See, I'm just mean staying at the top of the pile
And doin' soft note tunes it ain't my style
And this concludes our program
Of how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam
Now first we take an average drum
Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb
It's no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
All kinda lyrics that's promised to play
To make everybody say

"They can be cold and ruthless no question about that
But sometimes it's more complicated"
(Yo Dre)
(You know what I want you to do?)
(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)
Now MC Ren is here working like super glue
No matter what I do, I'm always stickin' to you
'Cause I'm the pusher, supplying the fix
And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix
But I'm making obstacles of enemy traps
To catch any MC's with the weakest raps
Crucifyin in vain like just for usin' my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game
If they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time
'Cause they're comittin' a crime, and still promotin' a rhyme
So, you in the back of me just listen and learn
Because you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn
Now my assignment was to give a preview
So at my next concert I wanna see you there
Not sittin' in a chair, standin' on both feet with yo hand in the air
Now I'm about to jet out but I'll be back
But next time expect a more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion
The prove that I'm hype and you know that's bet
Now continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set8Embed
