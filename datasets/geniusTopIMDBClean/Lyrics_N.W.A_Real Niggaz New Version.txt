Real Niggaz  New Version  Lyrics a different version than all previous releases
Every motherfucker always asks how did NWA get started
We dont know how it got started
Fuck that question you know what Im saying
Its the same bullshit over and over
How did we get started
How did we first meet
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo you shouldve covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you was a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker
Dont try to hang you best avoid it
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemrroids
Before you try to fuck with Ren
Ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting the size 10
First come first serve whoevers got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the world of the motherfucking HipHop maniac
Brainiac so what you ought to do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think your rap would last
With your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo be original your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you motherfucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums for many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles
Cheating and not beating the crowd are kept seating
But weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
And got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo giving what I gotta give doing what I gotta do
You dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
You cant harm me alarm me
Cause were the generals in this fucking HipHop army
The niggas with attitudes if you didnt know
We blow flow and then move slow from the get Go
Yo tie us to take it
Yo fuck this shit Yella kick the break in


Its the real thing
You are now    Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
You can run but you cant hide you know Im a find you
Cause a nigga like Ren is only two steps behind you
Dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep with the lights on forget that the Mics on
Dont step on my motherfucking stage without Nikes on
Dont say its psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
All these niggas with the gibber gabber
But couldnt kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer
Gangsters in black are out there
But only because yo its the shit that we wear
On my motherfucking dick
But Ima love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
So yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
Youll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead
Black the good the bad the ugly you see
A little street wise nigga you know me
Rolling with some real niggas playing for keeps
But you motherfuckers know who run the streets
With that hardcore HipHop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get
Trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
Since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
Cause Im the motherfucker thats out to kill
EazyE a nigga thats real
Timed bomb count down 
Real niggas straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without a second thought
And if your ass get smoked its my bullet you caught
So if youre talking shit about the niggas in black  Explosion 
Bow down to the Kings and Raider hats
They played out thats what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we aint happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
Yet so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes Ill come like a fucking bump
Asking for fucking money dont buy you a fucking crumb
Youre on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
Because if I let you slide its just cause you lucked up
Dont come in my face again because Im a floor you
And if youre a bitch Ima fucking ignore you
Because my attitude is a little bigger
Cause MC Ren is one of the Real Niggas
Lost in a motherfucking world of madness
Sadness but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucking motherfuckers like you making whack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When Im expressing standstill like youre full of Rigor Mortis
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess you figure
You can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
A nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out with too much cargo
So Im glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo NWA criticized for what we say
But Ima do the shit anyway
Cause Im the motherfucking doctor never faking
Yo Yella kick the motherfucking break in
Its the real thing
You are now    Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
Yeah motherfucker its the real thing
You are now    Dr Dre
Real real niggas niggas
NWA  Straight Outta motherfucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990s
Yo Dr Dre DJ Yella EazyE and I am MC Ren
Yo NWA taking over this motherfucker yall
