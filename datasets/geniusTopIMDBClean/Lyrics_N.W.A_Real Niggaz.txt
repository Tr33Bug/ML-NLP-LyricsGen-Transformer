Yo whats up niggas and niggettes
NWA is back in this motherfucker
And this is only the single
Wait until the motherfucking album comes out
We gone have some more of that good shit
The shit you just cant fuck with
But yo we aint finished tell em whats up man
Yo man theres a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick man
In every motherfuckin state
Wanna be like wanna look like wanna act like
Wanna dress like wanna sound like muthafuckin style stealin
Clone ass NWA bitin ass motherfuckin everywhere man
Nonreality seein nonreality feelin
Nonreality livin ass motherfuckers man
Hey I dont know reality its important to me man
So fellas man tell these niggas what its like in the minds of real niggas
Prisoner like a hostage
Yo you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause yous a sucker
And you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Dont try to hang you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
Ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting a size 10
First come first serve whoevers got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a muthafucking hiphop maniac
Brainiac so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think a rap will last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo be original your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy
Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and now beating the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
Yo giving what I gotta give doing what I gotta do
You dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
You cant harm me alarm me
Cause were the generals in this fucking hiphop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didnt know
We blow flow and getting loose slow from the get go yo
Try us and take it
Yo fuck this shit Yella kick the break in
Its the real thing you are now real real niggas niggas
You can run but you cant hide you know Imma findcha
Cause a nigga like Rens only 2 steps behindcha
Dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on forget that the mics on
Dont step on my muthafucking stage without nikes on
Dont say its psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
All these niggas wit the jibber jabber
But couldnt kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because yo its the shit that we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But Imma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead
Black the good the bad the ugly you see
A little streetwise nigga you know me
Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hiphop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get
Trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
Since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
Cause Im a muthafucka thats out to kill
EazyE a nigga thats real
Real niggas straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked its my bullet you caught
So if youre talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats
They played out thats what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we aint having it
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it yo we really aint done shit
Yet so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes Ill come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money dont buy you a fucking crumb
Youre on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks you dont even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
Cause if I let you slide its just cause you lucked up
Dont come in my face again because Imma floor ya
And if youre a bitch Im a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitudes a little bigga
Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas
Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness but Dre is just a nigga that glad theres
Sucka muthafuckas like you making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When Im expressing stand still like youre full of rigor mortis
Cause Im a real nigga but I guess you figure
You can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
A nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So Im glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo NWA criticize for what we say
But Im a do the shit anyway
Cause Im the muthafucking doctor never faking
Yo Yella kick the muthafucking break in
NWA straight outta muthafucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990s
Yo Dr Dre DJ Yella EazyE
And I am MC Ren yo NWA taking over this muthafucka yall
