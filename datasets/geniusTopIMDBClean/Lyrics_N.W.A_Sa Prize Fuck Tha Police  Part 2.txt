Fuck the police Fuck fuck fuck the police
Fuck fuck fuck the police
Youre motherfucking right yo
Fuck the motherfucking police
They dont want peace they want a nigga deceased
So hell cease to be a problem and by the way the perform
It seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform
And yo the black police the house niggas
They gave you a motherfucking gun so I guess you figure
You made out good to go but you didnt know
They would stick your black ass back in the ghetto yo
To kill another nigga catch him with crack in fact
Freebase  they put in the neighborhood in the first place
But the brothers aint stupid remember that
You got a gat I got a gat so whassup with that
A to the motherfuckin K
The last words you hear then the smoke appears
Tears from your motherfuckin family
Theyre starin at me but Im goin gun happy fuck em
Shootin everything in sight tonights the night to get hyped
And fight for whats wrong fuck whats right
And by the way my name is Dre
So listen up motherfucker to what I gotta say yo
Now for the first episode 
Yeah that shits hittin man where the volume at
Holdup holdup holdup onetime onetime onetime
Put the joint out Put the joint out
Hey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car
Dont you know its against the law to play music so god damn loud
Shut the fuck up Go to jail Or gimme that shit you was just smoking
Motherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat
And thats some shit you betta not forget
Eazy Es the name feared by most
When a lil nigga is thrown in the pen
But on the streets theres two kinds of people
White rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me
Pull over to the side routine for me
Tearin up my shit like they lookin for a key of cocaine
But they never find the shit
Aint got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit
Thinkin everything is stolen
But cant face facts that a young black niggas just rollin
Making more money than they ever make
Taking more shit than they ever take
Yo pigs are made to kill and no regret and
Keep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin
Cause Im a nigga that dont give a fuck about nothin
So let me explain a lil somethin yo
See I got this problem a big problem
Cops dont like me so I dont like motherfucking cops
Episode Two
Get out of the fuckin car
Wait a god damn minute what the hell did I do
Hey just shut the fuck up black bitch
Wait a minute you aint gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair Let
Go of my motherfuckin hair
Hey just step the fuck back and shut up
Get your motherfuckin hands off of me
Calm down calm down now listen were gonna go around this corner and
Youre gonna suck me and my partners dicks or youre gonna
Be one black dead nigga bitch
Police brutality is common in my neighborhood
Thats why I hate them motherfuckers
I said fuck the police but with a little more force
And maybe now I get my point across
Its a massacre goin on just open your eyes and look
Everyday a young nigga is took
Off the face of the street by a police
Its like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
You cant leave out the city that they shacked up
Cause if you do thats the right they got you jacked up
Its embarassin because you know they justice but all you can do
Is say fuck this because if you move thats all she wrote
So whats the excuse to shoot or they rather stomp your head
Til youre dead with the steeltoe boot
Harassin me with some kind of mind game
Actin like a nigga just was born with a gangname
You call that right but when youre black theres no right
Some recreational shit was only a gang fight
So shootin at the cops was a street thing
To waste time as we slanged off the cocaine
But everything was done just for peace
To retaliate on the fuckin police so Im sayin
The final episode 
Episode Three
Hey Juan look at the piece of ass man
Watch out watch out watch out homes
Oh shit man you fucked up you hit a police car
I didnt see that piece of caca
Better act like you dont speak ingles homes
What the fuck Get your ass out of there Ive had enough
Of your raggedy ass motherfucking shit
Oh man no me pegues por que me pegas No por favor no No Por que
Chinga tu pinche madre pinche policias weyes pendejos salvajes culeros
