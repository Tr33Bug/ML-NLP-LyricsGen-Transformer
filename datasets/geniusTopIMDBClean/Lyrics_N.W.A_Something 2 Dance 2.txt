Yo give me somethin to dance to
Calling the police calling the GMen
Calling all Americans to war in the Underworld
Arabian Prince back wit a style thats hype
Not slow and low its the fast type
Getting dumb can you hear the drums
Yo Dre why dont you pump it up some
I pumped it up so now whats up
Yo Yella boy add a little cut
What the hell you think we need some bells
Yeah homeboy might as well
There it is so now whats next
A little sss so find me a
Hold it wait a minute
You need somethin else in it
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove bust a move
Yo yo Im tired what about you
Man this is somethin to dance to
Man thats wack everybody used that
Yo why dont you bring back the other track
Yeah there you go thats what Im sayin
I like it when that dope stuffs playin
Real loud in ya ear hole
Man lets go I think my feet are swoll from dancin so damn much
Man I dont give a what
You wanna leave With all these females pullin on my sleeve
Aight bet you can jet homeboy no sweat
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove bust a move
Here I come to save the day 
This is somethin to dance to
Let the bass kick
Thththis is somethin ta dance to
Thththis is somethin ta dance to
Thththis is somethin ta dance to
Thththis is somethin ta dance to

Thththis is somethin ta dance to
Thththis is somethin ta dance to
