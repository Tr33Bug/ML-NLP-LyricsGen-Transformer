Ah yeah yo Ren yo ready to do this shit
Yeah Dre lets rip shit up
Hey yo Yella Boy why dont you kick me one of them funky ass beats
Yo we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house
Yeah Comptons definitely in the house
Yo Ren what we gonna call this shit Tell em what yo name is
Yeah something like that
Alright lets kick this shit on the one
Kick it
Back by demand now its big as fuck
Because you as the public you should know whats up
Comptons in the House was more than gold it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that wed hit it
But that was a part of showbiz
Hey yo homeboy why dont you tell em what your name is
Well for the record its Ren and for the street its villain
And strapped with a gat its more like Matt Dillon
On Gunsmoke but not a man of the law
Im just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
See I peep and then I creep on a fool
Get my blood pressure high but still stay cool
Dig a grave of a nigga lookin up to me
That really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
Who was the man in the mask while I was waitin to ask
You know its MC Ren kickin mucho ass
Gettin respect in showbiz
Hey yo homeboy whats up
Why dont you tell em what your name is
Dre the motherfuckin doctor bitch hopper
The suckermotherfucker stopper
Back with a vocal track thats a fresh one
So now lets get the motherfuckin session
Goin flowin Its time to start throwin  rhymes
So keep in mind all the suckers Im blowin
Cause Im a start showin the time
Never sayin Im the best and just goin for mine
Unlike a lotta suckers who claim theyre gettin busy
When their records only make good frisbees
You need to quit runnin off the mouth
Stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
Its not difficult in fact its kinda simple
To create something funky thats original
You either talkin bout the place to be
Who you are what you got or about a sucker MC


Oh yeah thats what Im talkin about Ren
You know what Im sayin
Yeah I know what youre sayin Dre but you still aint told em enough man
Alright alright
Well lets kick one more verse right here alright
Kick it
This is portable something to fuck with yo ear
Ren and Dre will appear when the sound is clear
To fuck it up like we always do and thats the trick
Sayin some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But its an everyday thang
Communicating to yall with the Compton slang
Comptons back in the house and your appartment
So open your door by the way so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel were gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin and shit now its a trip
Waitin for the grand finale or the end
Or stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren
Well like a kid we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin like hell as we move past the
Suckers the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Well were positive and theyre on a negative type
And if think were about to quit
Motherfucker you aint heard shit
Yeah that shit was funky you know what Im sayin Ren
I know what youre sayin this is MC Ren and Dr Dre
Cold kickin it in the place
Ah yeah my mellow Eazy E in the house
Yella Boy in the house
My boy Ice Cube
Arabian Prince cold rockin shit
Oh yeah hey Im a say whassup to my homeboys from CMW
Yeah hey yo Ren whatta we gonna call this shit
Tell em what yo name is
Yeah something like that
