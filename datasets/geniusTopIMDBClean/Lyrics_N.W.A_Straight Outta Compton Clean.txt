Straight Outta Compton  Clean  Lyrics
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton its a crazy brotha named Ice Cube
From the stupiddope gang wit a attitude
When Im called off I gotta sawedoff
Kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you get with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off yo back thats how Im going out
For the sucka dumb brothas thats showing out
Some start to mumble they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Going off on everybody like that
With bass thats droppin in your face
So give it up smooth
Aint no telling when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep you dancing
With a crime record like Charles Manson
Yo Dre whats the sound of my tool
Now you know that Im about to act a fool
Me you can go toe to toe no maybe
Im knocking suckas out the box daily
Yo weekly monthly and yearly
Until the whole damn world see clearly
That Im down with the capital CPT
Boy you cant step to me
So when Im in your neighborhood you better duck down
Cause Ice Cube will damn sure buck em down
As I leave believe Im stomping
But when I come back boy Im coming straight outta Compton
Yo Ren
Whassup
Tell em where you from
Straight outta Compton a brotha with his finger on the trigger
More punks I take out my rep gets bigger
Im a ruthless villain and you know this
But the suckas in the public wont show this
But I dont really care Imma make my snaps
If not from the records from jacking the craps
Its like burglary the definition is jacking
And when illegally armed its called packing
Knock a fool out in a sec
I find somebody talkin trash and put em in check
So if youre at a show in the front row
Imma call you a sucka if you dont go with the flow
Youll probably get mad like a punk is supposed to
But that shows me yo youre composed to
A crazy young brotha from the street
Attitude legit cause Im ready to hit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any fool in my way that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and thats a law
REN spells Ren but Im raw
See cause people know me as a villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killing
Thats taking place without a clue
And once youre on the scope you know youre through
Look you might take it as a trip
But a brotha like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother thatll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous young brotha raising hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont really care thats the problem
When I see a police I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see the punk pass I smile
To me its kinda funny the attitude showing suckas driving
But dont know where the hell they going just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless
Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see Ill get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and now Im jetting
And leave a memory no onell be forgetting
So what about the girl who got shot 
You think I give a damn about a girl I aint a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E
And if you ever mess with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the mother yeah
Straight outta Compton
Thats the way it goes in the city of Compton boy
