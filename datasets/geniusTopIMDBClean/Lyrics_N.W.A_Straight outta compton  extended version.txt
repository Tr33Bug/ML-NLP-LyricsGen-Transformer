Straight outta compton - extended version Lyrics
I'm comin' straight outta Compton
When something happens in south of central Los Angeles
Nothing happens, it's just another n**** dead
Verse One: Ice Cube
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherf***er named Ice Cube
From the gang called n****z With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if ya f*** with me
The police are gonna hafta come and get me
Off yo a**, that's how I'm goin out
For the punk motherf***ers that's showin out
N****z start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherf***er like that
With a gat that's pointed at yo a**
So give it up smooth
Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act the motherf***in fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knockin n****z out tha box, daily
Yo weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherf***ers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy you can't f*** with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as f***
As I leave, believe I'm stompin
But when I come back, boy, I'm comin straight outta Compton
Chorus:
 Yo Ren
 Whassup?
 Tell em where you from!
Verse Two: MC Ren
Straight outta Compton, another crazy a** n****
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherf***er and you know this
But the p**** a** n****z won't show this
But I don't give a f***, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jackin the crops
Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'
And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'
Shoot a motherf***er in a minute
I find a good piece o' p****, And go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'm a call you a b**** or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a b**** is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy muthaf***er from tha street
Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up s***
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthaf***er that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, coz I'm the motherf***in villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin
That's takin place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your a** is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a n**** like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton...

 Eazy is his name and the boy is comin...
Verse Three: Eazy-E
...straight outta Compton
Is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother
And make ya sister think I love her
Dangerous motherf***er raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See, I don't give a f***, that's the problem
I see a motherf***in cop I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a n**** drivin
But don't know where the f*** he's going, just rollin
Lookin for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin
So what about the b**** who got shot? f*** her!
You think I give a damn about a b****? I ain't a sucka!
This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever f*** with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
Word to the motherf***er, straight outta Compton
Chorus:
