Im comin straight outta Compton
When something happens in south of central Los Angeles
Nothing happens its just another n dead
Verse One Ice Cube
Straight outta Compton crazy motherfer named Ice Cube
From the gang called nz With Attitudes
When Im called off I got a sawed off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if ya f with me
The police are gonna hafta come and get me
Off yo a thats how Im goin out
For the punk motherfers thats showin out
Nz start to mumble they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Goin off on a motherfer like that
With a gat thats pointed at yo a
So give it up smooth
Aint no tellin when Im down for a jack move
Heres a murder rap to keep yo dancin
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK47 is the tool
Dont make me act the motherfin fool
Me you can go toe to toe no maybe
Im knockin nz out tha box daily
Yo weekly monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfers see clearly
That Im down with the capital CPT
Boy you cant f with me
So when Im in your neighborhood you better duck
Coz Ice Cube is crazy as f
As I leave believe Im stompin
But when I come back boy Im comin straight outta Compton
Chorus
Yo Ren
Whassup
Tell em where you from
Verse Two MC Ren
Straight outta Compton another crazy a n
More punks I smoke yo my rep gets bigger
Im a bad motherfer and you know this
But the p a nz wont show this
But I dont give a f Ima make my snaps
If not from the records from jackin the crops
Just like burglary the definition is jackin
And when illegally armed its called packin
Shoot a motherfer in a minute
I find a good piece o p And go up in it
So if youre at a show in the front row
Im a call you a b or dirtyass ho
Youll probably get mad like a b is supposed to
But that shows me slut youre composed to
A crazy muthafer from tha street
Attitude legit cause Im tearin up s
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb muthafer that starts static
Not the right hand cause Im the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and thats a law
REN spells Ren but Im raw
See coz Im the motherfin villain
The definition is clear youre the witness of a killin
Thats takin place without a clue
And once youre on the scope your a is through
Look you might take it as a trip
But a n like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

Chorus
Eazy is his name and the boy is comin
Verse Three EazyE
straight outta Compton
Is a brotha thatll smother yo mother
And make ya sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfer raises hell
And if I ever get caught I make bail
See I dont give a f thats the problem
I see a motherfin cop I dont dodge him
But Im smart lay low creep a while
And when I see a punk pass I smile
To me its kinda funny the attitude showin a n drivin
But dont know where the f hes going just rollin
Lookin for the one they call Eazy
But heres a flash they never seize me
Ruthless Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload see Ill get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Give a little gust of wind and Im jettin
But leave a memory no onell be forgettin
So what about the b who got shot f her
You think I give a damn about a b I aint a sucka
This is the autobiography of the E and if you ever f with me
Youll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother
Word to the motherfer straight outta Compton
Chorus
