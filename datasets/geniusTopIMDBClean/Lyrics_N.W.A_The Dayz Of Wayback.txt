What we gonna do right here is go back
Now this is some shit thats from the days of wayback
When niggas in Compton first started to jack
When the bitches wouldnt give you no pussy
If you wasnt sellin drugs
So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged
They always loved that shit they want a nigga thats sellin keys
But nowadays they workin at Mickey Ds
But in the days of wayback I couldnt be laid back
Because I needed ends and I made that
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin muthafuckas just like Cowboys and Indians
Anythin it took to get paid
A nigga like Ren already had the plan made
And I was in it to win it and not to lose
And shitd start blowin up once I lit the fuse
And police couldnt touch me because I was payin em
But not with no money yo I was sprayin em
And never get caught because nobody is snitch
But one hoe did so Ren had to shoot the bitch
Now shes in a coffin and my life is better off and
Cause everybody knows whos the boss and
That black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me you gotta fuck with a Mac10
So listen to me as I reminisce the days of wayback
So check it out yall
It was once a time in the days of wayback
When niggas was gettin jacked
In fact it was when I used to pass through the
And kickin ass through a muthafuckin Compton Massacre
Now let me tell you a little somethin about Compton
When I was a kid and puttin my bid in
Yo Compton was like still water  just strictly calm
Now its like muthafuckin Vietnam
Everybody killin tryin to make a killin
Niggas stealin muthafuckas willin to dealin
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didnt give a fuck
About another muthafucka in this game and
Claimin what he claimin livin like he livin killin after killin
Murder was a dirty job to rob a dead man was the best plan
Cause a dead man never ran
But now your best friend is your worst friend
Greed kids to feed make a me more some of what you holdin
So now your shit is stolen and you and your niggas start rollin
Yo to get your shit back aint the word up
Muff Its more murder more murder more murder
They wanna make you think that its a crack thang or a black thang
Or some niggas in a muthafuckin gang
But guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me
Rememberin the days thats past me
Yo never givin niggas a chance to rest
The ghetto is like a fuckin survival test
And number one way for you to pass
Yo get treated like a king and theyll crown your ass
They never in the wrong though so I made a song so
Muthafuckas would know
If your livin situations make you wanna get a gat  a gat 
Thats cause you livin in the Dayz of Wayback
Surprise niggas
You dont think I could do it again did ya
Another album
The jokes on you Jack
Yeah Yeah Ha ha ha ha We did it again  We did it again
