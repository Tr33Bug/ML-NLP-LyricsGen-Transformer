You cocked back
You thought you had it planned you thought you had your man
He saw you coming he ran when you tried to blast that man
Missed him by inches he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of em pull through but one didnt sons finished
You took the life of him
The part about it thats crazy you was aight with him
Tight with him why was he in the way
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day
His style never hollas loud stays reclusive
Good dude got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why cause of a
Accident murderer act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag you put work in
You aint mean to murk him your guns a virgin
Streets are full of em read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
We grew up doing graffiti now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all we balling til they come lock us up
20 to life Im clubbing blowing 20 tonight
We the mob Bob Marley Marlin all through the night
Addicted to wealth never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf live forever thats InshAllah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits gold chains old drug dealers
New Benz chrome rims are for show killer
You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes stay alive cant be dodging my clique
Cut a check I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole sell your home nigga go sell your soul
This fortyfive in control God forgives and I dont
Accident murderer act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag you put work in
You aint mean to murk him your guns a virgin
Streets are full of em read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
Accident murderer
Accident murderer you just an accident murderer
Yo for my nigga that got killed got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete light a swisha we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home shot in the dome
How they gon kill that beautiful sister
Violent adolescents homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds that Im guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands choke em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man I see them now they repping
But they coldblooded homie wondering where the respect went
Cant play with these little niggas gangsta little niggas
Cant hang with these little niggas theyre killing theyre reckless
Wish I could build with him but will he change really
Some real killers I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz but you arent a name to me
You aint mean to kill him it wasnt necessary
Accident murderer act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag you put work in
You aint mean to murk him your guns a virgin
Streets are full of em read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
