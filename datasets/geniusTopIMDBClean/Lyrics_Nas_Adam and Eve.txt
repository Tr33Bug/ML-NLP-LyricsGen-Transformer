The ghetto Othello the Moor
Oh my God they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord my enemy is fear and Im sure
Oh my God they want the end of me cause Im pure
Oh my Lord discipline for the win I just go for it
Its a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom blessings were given
Pray my sins dont get passed to my children
I made a killin Im alive like the morning star
Court Jordans for the price on stock so what the Hornets are
I need evaluations Im savvy yall
Eatin foie gras and caviar listen
Adam and Eve
Dont fall too far from the apple tree ayy
Adam and Eve Adam and Eve
Dont fall too far from the apple tree apple tree
The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger the force of this banger
Yeah my language advanced my cadence amazin
The voice triggers somethin what is this conundrum
The clouds scurry your spirit rumble a boyish smile
Still puff the loud its nothin less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk Havana cigar the ganja spark
See my doctor more sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me have me under they belt slightly offended
Yeah thats how I felt thats how it ended
Im just good at existin existin in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit yeah


Adam and Eve
Dont fall too far from the apple tree ayy
Adam and Eve Adam and Eve
Dont fall too far from the apple tree apple tree
What come first peace or the paper
Before I had a piece of paper peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat extract the weak bon appetit
No bacon brothers is swine
Its so hard to trust em cause my hustle is mine
Its evident they all the same with gray hair and still mean muggin
Gray hairs of wisdom that means you seen somethin
Say somethin you stay frontin
But these clowns got false crowns fictitional kings
You broke my heart Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin enterprisin at a bosss table
Theres always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin you disabled
All this money to get is there less time
They aint stopped printin money cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time these are the best times
Im in my neighborhood in stadiums the Mets kind
With restaurants and Carbone spicy rigatoni
Go hard a red Bordeaux oh God
Adam and Eve
Dont fall too far from the apple tree ayy
Adam and Eve Adam and Eve
Dont fall too far from the apple tree apple tree
