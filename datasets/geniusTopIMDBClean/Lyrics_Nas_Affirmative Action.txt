This is what this what they want huh
This is what its all about
Word time to take Affirmative Action son
They just dont understand you knamean
Niggas comin sideways thinkin stuff is sweet man
Niggas dont understand the four devils
Lust envy hate jealousy
Wicked niggas man
Yo sit back relax catch your contact sip your congiac
And lets all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact touch mines and Ill react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break
Undress em tie em with tape  no escape
The Corleone fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone face it homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats politickin daily wit diplomats
See me Im an official mack Lex Coupe triple black
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destinys to be the new boss
A nigga Paulie gotta die he too soft
That niggas dead on a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch wit his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo the smoothest killer since Bugsy bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo my people from Medina they will see ya when you reup
Bring your heater all your CREAM go between us
Real shit my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
Mega  the pretty boy with Mafia connections
Its The Firm nigga set it
Yo my mind is seein through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry sippin on crushed grapes we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
Its sickenin he just finished biddin upstate
And now the projects is talkin that somebodygottadie shit
Its logic  as long as its nobody thats in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr Coffee
Feds cost me two mill to get the system off me
Lifes a bitch but God forbid the bitch divorce me
Ill be flooded with ice so Hell fire cant scorch me
Cuban cigars meetin Foxy at Demars movin cars
Your top papi Seor Escobar
In the black Camaro Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
EMoneybags got Mot Chandon
Bundle of sixtytwo
They aint got a clue what we about to do
My whole team we shittin hard like Czar
Sosa Foxy Brown Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby
From BK to The Bridge my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz so what the deal is
I keep a phat jewel sippin Cristy
Sittin on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van uh
We stay incogni like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods  they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though an ounce mixed with leak thats pure though
Flippin the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait its halfandhalf
Kis is one and twofifth so how we flip
32 grams raw chop it in half get 16
Double it times three
We got 48 which mean a whole lot of CREAM
Divide the profit by four subtract it by eight we back to 16
Now add the other two that Mega bringin through
So lets see if we flip this other ki then thats more for me
Mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is twofifty
Now triple that  times three
We got three quarters of another ki
The Firm baby Vol
