I know you can feel the magic baby
Turn the motherfuckin lights down
Esco whattup  Whattup homie 
I mean its what you expected aint it  Hahaha 
Lets go uhh uh uhh uh uhh uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh yeah thats perfect  yeah right right 
Uhh uh you gotta take ya time make a nigga wait on this muhfucka  hahaha 
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin after four bars nigga go in
Just start dancin in this muhfucka
Yeah  yeah  we just come outta nowhere
I feel like a Black Republican money I got comin in
Cant turn my back on the hood I got love for them
Cant clean my act up for good too much thug in him  nah 
Probably end up back in the hood like Fuck it then
Huddlin over the oven we was like brothers then  what 
Though you was nothin other than a son of my mothers friend
We had covenant who wouldve thought the love would end
Like Ice Colds album  uhh  all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all woodgrain all good brain
We wouldnt bicker like the other fools talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign could bring
Should blame the game and I could
Its kill or be killed how could I refrain
And forever be in debt and thats never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it it just aint the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things like cars jewelry and Miss Thing
Jealousy ego and pride and this brings
It all to a head like a coin chaching
The root of evil strikes again this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy  indefinitely


I feel like a black republican money I got comin in
Cant turn my back on the hood I got love for them  uhh uhh 
Cant clean my act up for good too much thug in him  nah 
Probably end up back in the hood Im like Fuck it then
I feel like a black militant takin over the government
Cant turn my back on the hood too much love for them  nah 
Cant clean my act up for good too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood Im like Fuck it then
Im back in the hood they like Hey Nas  uh 
Blowin on purp reflectin on they lives  uh 
Couple of fat cats couple of AIs
Dreamin of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s hatahs wishin our reign dies
Pitch sling pies and niggas they sing Why  uhh 
Guess they aint strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin follow the street signs
Im standing on the roof of my building
Im feelin the whirlwind of beef I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin 80 proof bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good that form street politics
Makes a sweet honest kid turn illegal for commerce  uhh 
To get his feet out of them Converse  thats my word
I feel like a black republican money keep comin in
Cant turn my back on the hood I got love for them  uhh uhh 
Cant clean my act up for good too much thug in him  nah 
Probably end up back in the hood ah Fuck it then
I feel like a black militant takin over the government
Cant turn my back on the hood too much love for them
Cant clean my act up for good too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood Im like Fuck it then
