I guess you knew and blew a good thing baby
Bye baby I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar that was an awesome day
Did counselling couldnt force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do we go astray
Why did we mess it up We was friends we had it all
Reason you dont trust men that was your daddy fault
He in the grave  let it go he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us Heres the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags we burning cash now baby do it up
No matter who you fuck that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming
Hate you so much right now
Shouldve saw the meaning angry black woman
Actions of a demon Im leaving
I guess you knew and blew a good thing baby  Bye baby 
You know Im saying byebye  Byebye baby 
Cause Im saying byebye  Bye baby 
Cause Im saying byebye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing baby
Bye baby I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy bout to have my seed
Lets take it back some years rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam Im thinking you cats are weird
Same time different year I was digging yall flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself  and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life like Ha yo look at my wife
Gangsta me and 20 cops bout to fight crazy night
Bailed you out next morning we got clean
Like it never happened and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasnt enough so baby guess what
I guess you knew and blew a good thing baby  Bye baby 
OH OH AHHHHHHHH Byebye  Byebye baby 
I cant believe that this is happening to us
Cause Im saying byebye  Bye baby 
Cause Im saying byebye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing baby
Listen could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending
With you paying out the ass and Im talking half
Not some but half no serious half
Half of your soul half of your heart you leaving behind
Its either that or die I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath saying Why did Nas trust her
But look at yourself Speak louder bruh
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride fake pimps you aint even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy my little joy and pride
He got my nose my grill your color your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again  its a beautiful life aight
Goodbye
Bye baby  Baby baby
You know Im saying byebye  Byebye baby 
I cant believe that this is happening to us
Cause Im saying byebye  Bye baby 
I guess you knew and blew a good thing
You know Im saying byebye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing baby
Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye
