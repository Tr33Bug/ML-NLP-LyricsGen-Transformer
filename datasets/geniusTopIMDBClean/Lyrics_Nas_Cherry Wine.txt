Where is he the man who was just like me
I heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
Where is he the man who was just like me
Heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
And Im alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes Im alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
I want someone who like the champagne I like my aalike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live she aint afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs natural medicine she cookin good
She tell me everything is cool when it aint lookin good
For real the world so ill yo I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as theres no selfishness
Yes as long as her love for the people is deeprooted and evident
You can be easily recruited youre heavensent
Your smile put me at ease
Youre the woman I need but where is she
Where is he the man who was just like me
I heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
Where is he the man who was just like me
Heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
And Im alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes Im alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry


I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyles perception
Invade my personal life Out of the question
What are they expectin
I be tryin to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever Im rollin in dough swimmin in a pool of cash
God wouldnt they know or am I a fool to ask
Im well known got people comin at me mad
I had to tell homes I dont keep a cell phone my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head the curse of the talented
Strong communicator vagabond
Id gallivant around the Equator if that would get me off the radar
Its so intense Im on my Lilo  Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime what is this
An immaculate version of Me  My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me
Where is he the man who was just like me
I heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
Where is he the man who was just like me
Heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
And Im alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes Im alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yeah yeah lets pour some cherry wine
Everythings good everythings fine
Yeah yeah we bring it every time
Yeah pour a little cherry wine
Yeah hey yo Salaam
Yeah I think they know the time
Everythings good everythings fine
Yeah pour a little cherry wine yeah
Life is good life is good yeah
Life is good no matter what life is good
Life is good life is good yeah
No matter what life is good
Where is he the man who was just like me
I heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
Where is he the man who was just like me
Heard he was hidin somewhere I cant see
And Im alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes Im alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
