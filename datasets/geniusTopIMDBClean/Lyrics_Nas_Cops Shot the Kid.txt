The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
Alright you kids stop having so much fun move along
Oh theyd arrest me you know especially at night
They had a curfew niggas had to be home at 11 negros 12
And youd be trying to get home doing your crew runs
And theyd always catch you out in front of a store or something
Cause youd be taking shortcuts right
Cops Ree put your hands up black boy
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid the cops shot

I dont wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames exchange some names
Im a top shotta kid stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid same old scene
Pour out a little liquor champagne for pain
Slapboxin in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin they roundups we just watch for the sweep
Yeah its hotter than July
Its the summer when niggas die
Its the summer when niggas ride
Together well be strong but forever we divide
So yall are blowin my high
Type of shit thats killin my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared you panic youre goin down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon bury their own kids
Not the other way around
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Lets remind em why Kap kneels
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid the cops shot
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid the cops shot

Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news people is all lyin
Money is bein made when a mom cries
Wont be satisfied til we all die
Tell me who do we call to report crime
If 911 doin the driveby
Its certain things I cant abide by
I aint bein extreme this is my side
Talkin big shit ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid he wasnt that guy
Had a little hit he wasnt that high
Cop gon claim that it was selfdefense
Say he was ridin dirty so the case rests
The cops shot the kid
