I call it yeah yeah
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up first I regretted it then caught my rage
Like how could I not protect her from this awful phase
Never tried to hide who I was she was taught and raised
Like a princess but while Im on stage I cant leave her defenseless
Plus shes seen me switchin women Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin
So if her husband is a gangster cant be mad Ill love him
Never for her I want better homie in jail  dead that
Wait til he come home you can see where his heads at
Niggas got game they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib plus Im sure he know who your father is
Although you real plus a honest kid
Dont think Im slow I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen I got a problem with it
She looked at me like Im not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin with it
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important


This morning I got a call nearly split my wig
This social network said Nas go and get your kid
Shes on Twitter I know she aint gon post no pic
Of herself underdressed  no inappropriate shit right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she dont know what got inside this childs mind she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagramd it
At this point I realized I aint the strictest parent
Im too loose Im too cool with her
Shouldve drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school so she can get a balance
To public school theyre too nurture teen talents
They grow fast one day shes your little princess
Next day shes talkin boy business  what is this
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back he makes us have precious little girls
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters I call this
For my brothers with daughters I call this
Not sayin that our sons are less important
And I aint tryin to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It aint easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date he straight chip off his own papa
When she date we wait behind the door with a sawedoff
Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love
