Get get get down
Uh uh uh
New York streets where killersll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends the drugs kept the hood from starvin
Pushin cars Nicky Barnes was the 70s
But theres a long list of highprofile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings some died one guy one time
One day grabs me as Im about to blast heat
40side of Vernon I turned while he asked me
What you up to The cops gon bust you
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us I aint flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs the bathroom mirror brushed my hair
Starin at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man throwin them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl aint wait for him she in the world straight hoein
While he lookin at centerfolds of pretty girls showin
They little cooch gangstas dont die hes living proof
The DA who tried him was lyin
A white dude killed his mother during the case
Hung jury now the DA is being replaced
Pretrial hearing is over its real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom the look in his eyes is wild
Triplehomicide I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officers gun and started squeezin
Then he grabbed the judge screams out Nobody leavin
Everybody
Get down get down Get down get down
Get get get get get get get down
Everybody
Get down get down Get down get down
Get get get get get get get down
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch em
Weirdass niggas who dangerous so dont test em
They make you disappear this a year that I wont forget
Sold CDs double platinum met mo execs
Southern niggas independent label real killers
Know the business ran Tennessee for years now they chillin
They had the coke game somethin crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts sherm or somethin
Took a puff what the fuck I turned to punch him
Southern niggas aint slow nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes they cool but they crazy
Now Im back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters we loungin out in LA see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say Nas I got your back the fools dont play
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousins in the game thuggin and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was halfMexicano
Gave the ass up Im a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippytoed thought my eyes were closed
Openin the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin to do with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin told him I aint fuckin with you
He responded cool but told me out here this how motherfuckers


Get down get down Get down get down
Get get get get get get get down
Everybody
Get down get down Get down get down
Get get get get get get get down
All I really gotta say is that
If thats how our people gon get down how we ever gon get up
How we ever gon get up if thats how we get down
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change
