Got Ur Self a Lyrics
Woke up this mornin  Yeah 
You got yourself a gun  Yeah yeah yeah 
Got yourself a gun
Yo Im livin in this time behind enemy lines so
I got mine I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you Ima take what I want so
You tried to front hope you got yourself a gun
You aint real hope you got yourself a gun
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome Im crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question whos better The world is still mine
Tattoos real with Gods Son across the belly the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames could huddle your teams shook
Yall feel the wrath of a killer cause this is my football field
Throwin passes from a barrel shoulder pads apparel
But the QB dont stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawedoff blast cause yall all soft
And Im the black hearse that came to haul yall ass in
Its for the hood by the corner store
Many try many die come at Nas if you want a war get it bloody
I got mine I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you Ima take what I want so
You tried to front hope you got yourself a gun
You aint real hope you got yourself a gun yo
Im the N the A to the SIR
And if I wasnt I mustve been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed hair parted with a
Barbers preciseness Bravehearted for life its
Return of the golden child son of a blues player
So who are you player Yall awaited the true savior
Puffin that tropical cups of that vodka too
Papi chus tore up wake up in a hospital
Throw up Never member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone so in light of my death
Yall been all happygolucky bunch of sambos
Call me Gods Son with my pants low
I dont die slow put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though in my Nascar with this Nas flow
What could beat that Not a soul reppin
Hit the record store never let me go get my whole collection yo
I got mine I hope you got yourself a gun
You from the hood I hope you got yourself a gun
You want beef Hope you got yourself a gun
And when I see you Ima take what I want so
You tried to front hope you got yourself a gun
You aint real hope you got yourself a gun
Its the return of the prince the boss
This is real hardcore Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris get chips wrist glist I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off rich kids go and cop The Source
They dont know about the blocks Im on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough where does he live Is he still in the Bridge
Does he really know how ill that he is
Got all of yall watchin my moves my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe dodge interviews like that
Its not only my jewels ice anything plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes I iced that

And when I see you Ima take what I want so
You tried to front hope you got yourself a gun
