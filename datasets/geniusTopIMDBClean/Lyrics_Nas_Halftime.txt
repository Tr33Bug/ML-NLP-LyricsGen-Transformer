Right Right 
Check me out yall
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Before a blunt I take out my fronts
Then I start to front matter of fact I be on a manhunt
You couldnt catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
Thats like Malcolm X catchin the Jungle Fever
King poetic too much flavor Im major
Atlanta aint Braver I pull a number like a pager
Cause Im a ace when I face the bass
40side is the place that is givin me grace
Now wait another dose and you might be dead
And Im a Nikehead I wear chains that excite the Feds
And aint a damn thing gonna change Im a performer strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas why did you do it
You know you got the madphat fluid when you rhyme
Its halftime
Right  Its halftime
Right  Ayo its halftime
Right  Its halftime
Right  Yeah its about halftime
This is how it feel check it out how it feel
Its like that you know its like that
I got it hemmed now you never get the mic back
When I attack there aint a army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
Cause Im as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes I flex like sex
In your stereo sets Nasll catch wreck
I used to hustle now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels wear jewels hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mothers stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise cause Im wise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in 83 I was an MC sparkin
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps cause I thought niggas wouldnt understand
And now in every jam Im the fuckin man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch CHiPs now I load Glock clips
I got to have it I miss Mr Magic
Versatile my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual Im an intellectual of rap
Im a professional and thats no question yo
These are the lyrics of the man you cant near it understand
Cause in the streets Im wellknown like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me Nas aint all that
And next time I rhyme I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial niggas say Im wild
I hate a rhymebiters rhyme
Stay tuned Nas soon the real rap comes at halftime
Right  Its halftime
Right  Exhale check it its halftime
Right  Its halftime
Right  Its real in the field
Word life check it
I got it goin on even flip a morning song
Every afternoon I kick half the tune
And in the darkness Im heartless like when the NARCs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it
Cause when I blast the herb thats my word
I be slayin em fast doin this that and the third
But chill pass to Andre and lets slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matine
Puttin hits on 50
Cause when its my time to go I wait for God with the 44
And biters cant come near
And yo go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I wont plant seeds dont need an extra mouth I cant feed
Thats extra Phillie change more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and
The Boogie Down enough props enough clout
Ill Will rest in peace yo Im out
Right  Its still halftime
Right  To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew you know its halftime
Right  92 its halftime
Right  Yo police police man yo lets get ghost
Halftime
