Escobar Season has returned
Its been a long time been a long time comin
Its life or death for me now
But you know theres no turnin back now
This is what makes me this is what I am
Feel me Lets go
You can hate me now  QB 
But I wont stop now  Real niggas 
Cause I cant stop now  Bravehearts 
You can hate me now  Cmon 
But I wont stop now
Cause I cant stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
Well you hate me Im gon hate you too
Its as simple as that
Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
You dont give a fuck I dont give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down  do it now 
Weak jealous motherfuckers  do it now do it now 
Fuck yall
Dont hate me hate the money I see clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear flows that I try
Close your eyes picture me rollin Sixes money foldin
Bitches honeys that swollen to riches Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my styles greater
Model dater big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin more to the big screen Bill Gates dreams
But it seems youd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate be my guest I suggest


Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary
You can hate me now  I wont stop 
But I wont stop now  I cant stop 
Cause I cant stop now  You can hate me 
You can hate me now  I hate you too 
But I wont stop now  You can hate me now 
Cause I cant stop now  Cmon 
You can hate me now  You can hate me now 
You can hate me now
Do it now I told you do it now
Lets go
You wanna hate me then hate me what can I do
But keep gettin money Funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up until I made it
Now yall sayin Thats a clever nigga nothin to play with
Hate on me I blew but Im the same OG
People warned me When youre on top theres envy
Took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
Sayin we left the hood but cant get it out of us
My bad should I step out my shoes give em to you
Heres my cars and my house you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets hate my dress code
Gucci this Fendi that  what you expect hoe
Nickname Esco took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole US know
Try to make it like you the realest but who the illest
Think we all know the answer to that cause niggas feel this right
You think Ima come this far
And let you niggas stop me now
I hate you too
You can hate me now  I wont stop 
But I wont stop now  I cant stop 
Cause I cant stop now  You can hate me 
You can hate me now  I hate you too 
But I wont stop now  You can hate me now 
Cause I cant stop now  You can hate me now 
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
I like this I like the way this feels
Its a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes nine millis and thirtyeights
Hell or the Pearly Gates I was destined to come
Predicted blame God he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jamming up the border to this game stop and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin niggas shot at my doors
Plottin Im sure to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin me up but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me ambulances were pickin them up
Niggas fear what they dont understand
Hate what they cant conquer guess its just inferior man
Became a monster on top of the world never fallin
Im as real as they come from day one forever ballin cmon
You aint never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And thats what you cant understand
You can hate me now  I wont stop 
But I wont stop now  I cant stop 
Cause I cant stop now  You can hate me 
You can hate me now  I hate you too 
But I wont stop now  You can hate me now 
Cause I cant stop now  You can hate me now 
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now  Cmon niggas 
But I wont stop now  Do it now Get this shit over with 
It aint gon never stop niggas
