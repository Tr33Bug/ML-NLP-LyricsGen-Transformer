Hip hop hip hop  Ugh  is dead
Had to flip this track again yall 
Hip hip hop hip hop  Ugh  is dead
Hip hip hop  Ugh 
Hip hip hop is dead  NYC Dirty South 
Hip hip hop  West Coast 
Hip hop  Midwest 
Hip hop  Lets go 
If hip hop should die before I wake
Ill put an extended clip and body em all day
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
Ill load an extended clip and body em all day
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Hip hop just died this morning
And shes dead shes dead 
Yeah niggas smoke laugh party and die in the same corner
Get cash live fast body their mans mama
Quick fast trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin hittin Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin hittin Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin hittin Brazilian dimes from behind 
Whenever if ever I roll up its sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya Nas helped grow us up
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin I helped blow em up
Gave my man my right I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy the kid went deaf
So people whos your top 10 Is it MC Shan Is it MC Ren


If hip hop should die before I wake
Ill put an extended clip and body em all day
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
Ill load an extended clip and body em all day
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Hip hop just died this morning
And shes dead shes dead 
The bigger the cap the bigger the peelin
Come through something ill missing the ceilin
What influenced my raps Stickups and killings
Kidnappings project buildings drug dealings
Criticize that whys that
Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack
Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you cant blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh I think they like me in my white tee
You cant ice me we here for life B
On my second marriage hip hops my first wifey
And for that we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together all together now
If hip hop should die before I wake
Ill put an extended clip and body em all day
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
Ill load an extended clip and body em all day
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Roll to every station wreck the DJ
Hip hop just died this morning
Hip hop just died this morning
Hip hop just died this morning
And shes dead shes dead 
Everybody sound the same commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasnt all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hiphopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man then a mobster
If it dies let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP well donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3s
From Beat Street to commercials on Mickey Ds
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
Im looking over my shoulder
Its about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut
