Damn
Look how muhfuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I dont get to say shit
Just grab me just do what the fuck they want
Sell me throw me away
Niggas just dont give a fuck about a nigga like me right
Like Im a f Im a gun shit
Its like Im a motherfucking gun
I cant believe this shit
Word up word up
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill thats why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle semiauto with lead
Im seven inches four pounds been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill but what I feel it never mattered
When Im empty Im quiet
Finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety niggas place me in shelves under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads
How you like me now I go blaow
Its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I mightve took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power I made you buckwild
How you like me now I go blaow
Its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power I made you buckwild
Always Im in some shit
My abdomen is the clip the barrels my dick
Uncircumcised pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear
Stunningly tears fall down the eyes of these socalled tough guys
For years Ive been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf wit a grenade
Met a wreckedup TEC with numbers on his chest that say
Fivetwoohninethreeeightfive and zero
Had a serial defaced hoping one day police would place
Where he came from a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owners hand
How you like me now I go blaow
Its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power I made you buckwild
How you like me now I go blaow
Its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power I made you buckwild
Yo weeks went by and Im surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me its bullets two vests and then a nine
Theres a grenade in a box and that TEC that kept crying
Cause he aint been cleaned in a year hes rusty its clear
Hes bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf his eyes bubbling
He said it was on I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking somebody stomped him out his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist the moment Ive been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
Its gats like me that accidentally go off making niggas memories
But this time its done intentionally
He walked me outside saw this cat
Cocked me back said Remember me
He pulled the trigger but I held on it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder I didnt budge
Sick of the blood sick of them thugs
Sick of wrath of the next mans grudge
What the other kid did was pull out no doubt
A newer me in better shape before he lit out he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor his wig split
So fast I didnt know he was hit its over wit
Heard mad niggas screaming niggas running cops is coming
Now Im happy until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn
