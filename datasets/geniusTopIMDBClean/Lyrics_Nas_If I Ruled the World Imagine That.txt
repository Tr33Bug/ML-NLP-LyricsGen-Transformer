If I Ruled the World  Imagine That  Lyrics
Life I wonder
Will it take me under
I dont know
Imagine smokin weed in the street without cops harassin
Imagine goin to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruisin blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter nights are colder
Feelin like life is over these snakes strike like a cobra
The worlds hot my son got knocked
Evidently its elementary they want us all gone eventually
Troopin outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage wed all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin fashion designer clothes
Lacin ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holdin dough no parole no rubbers
Go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read The World Is Mine
If I ruled the world  Imagine that 
Id free all my sons  I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be if you could be mine wed both shine 
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today in these last days and times 
The way to be Paradise life relaxin
Black Latino and AngloSaxon
Armani Exchange the Range
Cash Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew  how we do
Trees for breakfast dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies historys told foul but Im as wise as the old owl
Plus the Gold Child seein things like I was controllin clique rollin
Trickin sixdigits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris Id civilize every savage
Give me one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free stress free
No work release purple M3s and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
Id let Coretta ScottKing mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul but every girl I meetd go downtown
Id open every cell in Attica send em to Africa


If I ruled the world  Imagine that 
Id free all my sons  I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be if you could be mine wed both shine 
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today in these last days and times 
And then well walk right up to the sun hand in hand
Well walk right up to the sun we wont land
Well walk right up to the sun hand in hand
Well walk right up to the sun we wont land
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats heats mandatory
Runnin from Jake gettin chased hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down outta state
Wait I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Tryin to get laced flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Makin moves in Atlanta backandforth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin shit
If I ruled the world and everythin in it skys the limit
I push a Q45 Infinit i 
It wouldnt be no such thing as jealousies or B Felony
Strictly livin longevity to the destiny
I thought Id never see but reality struck
Better find out before your times out what the fuck
If I ruled the world  Imagine that 
Id free all my sons  I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be if you could be mine wed both shine 
If I ruled the world
Still living for today in these last days and times 
If I ruled the world if I ruled if I ruled  Imagine that 
Id free all my sons if I ruled if I ruled
I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls black diamonds black diamonds
Could it be if you could be mine wed both shine 
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today in these last days and times 
If I ruled the world if I ruled
If I ruled Id free all my sons
Black diamonds  I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love em love em baby
