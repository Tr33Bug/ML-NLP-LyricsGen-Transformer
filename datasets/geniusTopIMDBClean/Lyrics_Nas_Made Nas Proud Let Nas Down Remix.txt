Made Nas Proud  Lyrics
Freedom or jail clips inserted
A babys bein born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end as far as rap goes
Its only natural I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name
Yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus Nas wrote the Bible
Now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
I aint mad at you young king this unsung song is hauntin
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins my Old Earth grin sung a church hymn
She birthed in September took my first wind again the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz fled out lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas weak flow yo Cole lets murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas just bein nasty nigga
Military hat fatigue pants saggin Hennyd up
Execs askin will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor Arm and Hammer
But I had a appeal I was a charmer
Yet still bein my mamas son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was tryna be the Queensbridge Cosbys
But the street life robbed me of that so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help Older niggas was gettin mad
But thats the gift and the curse thats the good and the bad
At least you got Jay but he already one of the greats
And its hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign but they aint let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked thats when they point blame
So point blank young Cole you wont be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed I just wanted it to bring the warnin
Global warmin to that cold world you was breathin
Thats some advice I never got
If I dont sell another record Ill just steady rock
While you was writin down my rhymes I was just tryna show you
That if you say whats on ya mind you can stand the test of time
Now Im playin Born Sinner loud saw you live rock the crowd
Like wow you made your nigga Nas proud


So you aint let Nas down
Its just part of the game becoming a rap king my nigga
You aint let Nas down
How that sound Here the crown pass it to you like nothin nigga
You aint let Nas down
Long live the idols may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin
Large Professors my mentor thats how the story end
