Bravehearts Bravehearts Bravehearts
Now lets get it all in perspective
For all yall enjoyment a song yall can step with
Yall appointed me to bring rap justice
But I aint FiveO yall know its Nas yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best welldressed
With finesse in a white tee lookin for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city no doubt
But dont say my cars topless say the titties is out
Newness heres the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with swing around like you stupid
King of the town Yeah I been that
You know I clickclack  where you and your mens at
Do the Smurf do the Wop Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin 88 back
They shootin Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin big money playboy your times up
Where them gangstas Where them dimes at
They shootin Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin big money playboy your times up
Where them gangstas at Where them dimes at
This aint rappin this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo ass like your seats hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car we got the streetsweeper
Dont start none wont be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You dont wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimps drink down in his pimp cup
Thats the way you get Timberlandd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention free admission
Hustlers dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close you can feel where the tools kept
All my justcomin homies parolees
Get money leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face you people so phony
Pull out my waist the Eagle fourforty
They shootin Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin big money playboy your times up
Where them gangstas Where them dimes at
They shootin Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin big money playboy your times up
Where them gangstas at Where them dimes at
I see niggas runnin yo my mood is real rude
I lay you out show you what steel do
Mobsters dont box my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk chazzers
Like Pun said you aint even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz back seat TV plasma
Ladies lookin for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love let me feel how the head is
Females whos the sexiest is always the nastiest
And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class Mami reach in your bag pass the fifth
Im a leader at last this a don you with
My 9s will spit niggas lose consciousness
