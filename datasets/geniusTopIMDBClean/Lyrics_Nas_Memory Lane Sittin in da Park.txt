TranslationsEspaolEnglishMemory Lane  Sittin in da Park  Lyrics
Aight fuck that shit Word word
Fuck that other shit yknow what Im sayin
We gonna do a lil somethin like this
Yknow what Im sayin
Stay up on that shit 
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Knowm sayin Big Nas Grand Wizard God what is it
Its like  HahaÂ you know what Im sayin
Yo go ahead and rip that shit dun
I rap for listeners blunt heads fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessyholders and oldschool niggas then I be dissin a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor fuck whos the liver
My man put the battery in my back a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My durations infinite moneywise or physiology
Poetry thats a part of me retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hiphop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco bluntsll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
Its real grew up a trife life the times of white lines the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac cold strap
With my peeps thats into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler I guess that means peace
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dicerollin match from craps to ceelo
With sidebets so roll a deuce nothin below
Peace God  Peace God  now the shit is explained
Im takin niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
Its like that yall
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge


One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Aliz niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine God
Check the prognosis Is it real or showbiz
My window faces shootouts drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses only the drama
For real a nickelplate is my fate my medicine is the ganja
Heres my basis my razor embraces many faces
Youre telephone blown black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro dramatic automatic 44 I let blow
And back down popo when Im vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brains blank
I see dark streets hustlin brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin for somethin somell prosper some fail
Judges hangin niggas uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics thats real
Word to Christ a disciple of streets trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say Peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat that niggas name made bell rings black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo son heard he was kingpin
Yo fuck rap is real Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin outta Queensbridge
Comin outta Queensbridge
Comin outta Queensbridge
Comin outta Queensbridge
Comin outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Me number one and you know where me from
