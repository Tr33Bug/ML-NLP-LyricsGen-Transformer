TranslationsEnglishNY State of Mind Lyrics
Yeah yeah
Ayo Blackits time word  Word its time man 
Its time man  Aight man begin 
Yeahstraight out the fuckin dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas dont make it back
I dont know how to start this shit yonow
Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin musician inflictin composition
Of pain Im like Scarface sniffin cocaine
Holdin an M16 see with the pen Im extreme
Now bullet holes left in my peepholes
Im suited up with street clothes hand me a 9 and Ill defeat foes
Yall know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some EJ sittin bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin Grants with the ceelo champs
Laughin at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
Gpacks get off quick forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin through the block shootin
Time to start the revolution catch a body head for Houston
Once they caught us offguard the MAC10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up told brothers Back up  the MAC spit
Lead was hittin niggas one ran I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook couldnt look
Gave another squeeze heard it click Yo my shit is stuck
Tried to cock it it wouldnt shoot now Im in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now Im jettin to the buildin lobby
And it was full of children probly couldnt see as high as I be
So what you sayin  Its like the game aint the same
Got younger niggas pullin the triggers bringin fame to their name
And claim some corners crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight stickup kids they run up on us
45s and gauges MACs in fact
Same niggas will catch you backtoback snatchin your cracks
In black there was a snitch on the block gettin niggas knocked
So hold your stash til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if its good shell bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin and their wives basin
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence life is defined
I think of crime when Im in a New York State of Mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Be havin dreams that Im a gangsta drinkin Mots holdin TECs
Makin sure the cash came correct then I stepped
Investments in stocks sewin up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin gunfights with megacops
But just a nigga walkin with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I aint the type of brother made for you to start testin
Give me a Smith  Wesson Ill have niggas undressin
Thinkin of cash flow Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated Ima hijack Delta
In the PJs my blend tape plays bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black Im livin where the nights is jetblack
The fiends fight to get crack I just max I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life rings flooded with stones homes
I got so many rhymes I dont think Im too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me blamin us were held like hostages
Its only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
Im takin rappers to a new plateau through rap slow
My rhymin is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps full of villains and creeps
Thats where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
Im a addict for sneakers 20s of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothings equivalent to the New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Nasty Nas
