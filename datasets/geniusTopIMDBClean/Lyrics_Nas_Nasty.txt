Yall ready for Nas
Queensbridge yall ready to see Nasty Nas
Uh huh they ready 
Yeah word
Got some Rmy Martin
And some goodass cigars check it out
Ayo late night candlelight fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousanddollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get boxcutterd
Count how many bad honeys I slut its a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that Im under
Who gets money remain fly yeah I wonder
Eyes flutter its love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck panties start drippin
The ways of Carlito blaze torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII freaks women nice size
I ride like Porsches thick brown and gorgeous
It aint my fault semiautomatic weapons I brought
The world crazy Im rich and Im girlcrazy
Dick em convince em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion I lose em
Fellates me who hate me My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key my jewelry in HD
Silent rage pristine in my vintage shades
Im not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon
Maserati pumpin Biggie the great legend
Blastin Im after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis dig
Im so high I never land like Mike Jacksons crib
Vest on 45 still crack ya rib sacrilege
Talk trash bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now Im gross and repulsive
Talk money is you jokin
Cash everywhere in my bank in the sofa
In the walls in the cars in my wallet in my pocket
On the floors ceilings the safe bitch I got it
You envy but dont offend me
Im skinny but still Im too big for a Bentley
You are your car what could represent me
Too Godly to be a Bugatti you honestly
Must design me somethin Tommy Montana from Queens had before the 90s
Drug dealer car rush to the bar
Move niggas We dont give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin
Bet a hundred stacks niggasll run it back
Just havin fun I aint even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact haha


Nasty  Nasty kid
Nasty  Yeah
Nasty  The kid  Nasty  Yeah
Nasty  Nasty kid  Nasty 
For the hustlers thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin
Saying It was Nas I used to hustle with
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist past this
Since Im cakin up put funds in my safe laughin
And joinin the blunt passin you niggas was straight assin
Excuse the vulgarity Im still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin they drivin
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin
Fake it til you make it Ive driven those toys
Been in them wars in the streets cops kickin in doors
For my team nigga your flow cheap as limousine liquor
Im no fake rap CD listener sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my Gs tell these clowns make room for the king nigga
