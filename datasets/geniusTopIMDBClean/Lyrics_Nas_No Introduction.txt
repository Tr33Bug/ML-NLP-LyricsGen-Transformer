JUSTICE League
PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate
We was kids hungry
Moms working I was famished
She getting home late
So I decided now Im in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like Mister spareaquarter
Before Air Jordans Kareem AbdulJabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb How could I not partake
Fifteen I got a gun
Sixteen I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
Whats got inside my brain
A hustlers job aint done til he becomes a king
But Im a righteous son despite Im in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like Im some kind of lame
I never let them though I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow
Say YEAH Haha thank ya Ahhh Hallelujah
Yall dont hear me now Somebody help me
I remember early mornings syrup sandwiches sugar water yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells elevators was out of order yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
Im pushing forty she only twentyone
Dont applaud me Im exhausted G
Me and my red cup my blunt and my red cup
Yall wouldnt know me without one I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever I just act like Im civilized
Really whats in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back
Say YEAH Haha thank ya Ahhh Hallelujah
Yall dont hear me now Somebody help me
1990s Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em hit em and dead em
She says third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasnt the most faithful husband
Reveal my life you will forgive me
You will love me hate me judge me relate to me
Only a few will this how it sounds when youre too real
They think its just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of yall might know Kelis this goes to her with love
Also goes to yall lets see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either youll be laughing at me or youre laughing with me ha
Say YEAH Haha thank ya Ahhh Hallelujah
Yall dont hear me now Somebody help me
