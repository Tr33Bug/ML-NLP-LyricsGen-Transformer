What up kid I know shit is rough doin your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it black no time for lookin back its done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya why dont your lady write ya
Told her she should visit thats when she got hyper
Flippin talkin about he acts too rough
He didnt listen he be riffin while Im tellin him stuff

Fuckin with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo guess who got shot in the domepiece
Jeromes niece on her way home from Jones Beach

Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9s
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega Did you see him Are yall together
If so then hold the fort down represent to the fullest
Say whats up to Herb Ice and Bullet

You was my nigga when push came to shove

One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love

Dear Born youll be out soon stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin on
The crackheads stalkin loudmouths is talkin
Hold check out the story yesterday when I was walkin
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin somethin
Word to mother I heard him frontin
And he be pumpin on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together  what up son Whatever
Since Im on the streets Ima put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin on the Island but now in Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corners ours
On the reals all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill see you on the next VI
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks plus sent you flicks
Your brothers buckwildin in 4Main he wrote me
He might beat his case til he come home Ill play it lowkey
So stay civilized time flies

I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love


One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Minds in another world thinkin
How can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books bibles et cetera
Fuck a school lecture the lies get me vexeder
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin Ls while Im sleepin
A twoday stay you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome no phone left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin terrible
Fuckin with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home nobodys out but Shorty DooWop
Rollin two phillies together in the Bridge we call em oowops
He said Nas niggas caught me bustin off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tredeuce
He inhaled so deep shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack my army suit was black
We was chillin on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin mad shit
I had to school him told him dont let niggas fool him
Cause when the pistol blows
The one thats murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck families fucked up
Coulda caught your man but didnt look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo make the right man bleed
Shortys laugh was coldblooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12 tryin to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose wipin the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man Ima ghost I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake Shorty Wop one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
One love one love one love one love
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man  one love
To my man Herb one love
To my man  one love
Cant forget my motherfuckin heart Big  one love
To  yeah one love
