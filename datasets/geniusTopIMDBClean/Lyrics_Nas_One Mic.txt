One time
Yeah yeah
Yo all I need is one mic one beat one stage
One nigga front my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151 one sipll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips plottin shit
Mad violence who Im gon body This hood politics
Acknowledge it leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us roll up and try knockin us
One knee I ducked could it be my time is up
But my luck I got up the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin between the spots that Im hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back fuck gettin hit
This is my hood Ima rep to the death of it
Til everybody come home little niggas is grown
Hoodrats dont abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon sent from the stars sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stickup kids with no conscience leavin victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out
This is what Nas is bout nigga the time is now
Yo all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic  Thats all I need 
All I need is one mic  All I need niggas 
All I need is one mic  Yeah 
All I need is one blunt one page and one pen
One prayer tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirtythree theres thirtythree shots
From twin Glocks theres sixteen apiece thats thirtytwo
Which means one of my guns was holdin seventeen
Twentyseven hit your crew six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime hope your funeral
Never gets shot up bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin is fair niggas roll up shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin tastin revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years too many times
Now Im strapped with a couple of MACs two mini nines
If yall niggas really with me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
Theres nothin in our way they bust we bust they rush we rush
Lead flyin feel it I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war lie em down
Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now
All I need is one mic  Thats all I need niggas thats all I need 
All I need is one mic  Theres nothin else in the world 
All I need is one mic  Thats all a nigga need to do his thing you know 
All I need is one mic  This is all I need 
All I need is one life one try one breath Im one man
What I stand for speaks for itself they dont understand
Dont wanna see me on top too egotistical
Talkin all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is niggasll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns Im blastin cause Im a cool nigga
Thought I wouldnt have that ass done Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl eternal souls clashin
War gets deep some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin each other up in prison yards
Drama where does it start
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a copll get killed body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler purchased my Range niggas throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasnt true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace lighter load see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin police how can a kingpin squeal
This is crazy Im on the right track Im finally found
You need some soulsearchin the time is now
All I need is one mic  Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
All I need is one mic  All I ever needed in this world fuck cash 
All I need is one mic  Fuck the cars the jewelry 
All I need is one mic  To spread my voice to the whole world baby
