Light it uhh
Light it up uhh
The whole city is mine prettiest Don
I dont like the way P Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why its mentioned in my rhymes Fuck it
Its just an intro hate it or love it like it bump it or dump it
Write it across the stomach spell God son
Life is like a jungle black its like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact its harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on MAC strong couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body now they hauntin the block
Where they used to stand at somebodys takin they place
A younger man perhaps hand slaps cant understand that
Same walk same talk I wonder can that be possible
A thug dies another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you layin low with a bottle
Im blowin circles my state of mind purple
Light it light it uhh
Yeah light it up
Light it up uhh
Yall just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things yall ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out not even your girl is sacred
You dont trust a soul hold up you moldin soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybodys under six feet of ground but you
Still standin still roamin through the streets thats real
You a survivor knowin all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now thats ready
Trustin your judgment quick to put it down they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That aint love its hate think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you aint got a cut on your face
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell em how to reach through the bars holdin a mirror
Lookin down a tear in jail makin weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Coldblooded murderers universal
Hood to hood blowin smoke state of mind is purple


Light it up light it up light it up uhh
Light it up light it up light it up uhh
Uhh uhh uhh light it light it uhh
These hotheaded youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin before thinkin they easily irritated
And murders premeditated its a fact that we sinkin
When we should be climbin in a nutshell its just jail
Drug sales liquor and diamonds niggas rewindin
Instead of movin forward to blow up so whats the science
People shoutin police pushin the crowd
And on the grounds a young soldier with meat hangin out him
Am I hallucinatin off the hazin
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another niggas face in
Its a ugly nation cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
Its usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up then someonell snitch
A divideandfall strategy they arent fair
I dig in my bag of weed thats covered with orange hair
This Color Purplell make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anythingll hurt you so my state of minds all purple
