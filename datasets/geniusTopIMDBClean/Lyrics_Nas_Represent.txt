Straight up shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble gunsll blast niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot full of mad criminals
Who dont care guzzling beers
We all stare at the outoftowners
Aiyyo yo who that  They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers homicide chasing brothers
The Ds on the roof tryin to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters

Cause life aint shit but stress fake niggas and crab stunts

If it wasnt hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory breaking the locks

But if I hit rock bottom then Ima be the Son of Sam
