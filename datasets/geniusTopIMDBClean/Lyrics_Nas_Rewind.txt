Listen up gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair hon and put it in the air son
Dog whatever they call you God just listen
Ill spit a story backwards it starts at the endin
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in this chest of a nigga now he back to square one
Screamin shoot dont please I put my fifth back on my hip
Its like a VCR rewindin a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van they closin shut
Goin reverse slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin crazy like Go he there
Sittin back in his chair we hittin the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin records backwards of ACDC
I give my niggas dap jump out the van back first
Back upstairs took off the black shirt
Im in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so yall can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like Outside right we
So with my mouth wide holdin my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze plenty for you
Cause Jungle said Block your on enemys the
Hung up the phone then the phone rang
Im laid in the bed thinkin about this pretty young thing
Who left she came back her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her No hell she talkin bout Me kiss
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin with no hands a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me Stressed really Im
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin through the door she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And thats about the time the story begun
Thats when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said Son we found that nigga we gotta kill
Ayo son ayo son you hear me You hear me
Listen man
This dude right on the block right now man
I found him right now I see him right now
Lets kill him
Yo this Nas leave it peace
