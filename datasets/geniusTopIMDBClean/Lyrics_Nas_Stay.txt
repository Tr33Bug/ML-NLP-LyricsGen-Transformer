Peace to the Five Percenters online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas family men bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone kissable nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
Thats what I named my son Knight
He was born to be one thats how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer licked by an angels tongue
Im living dangerous son she got a man a famous one
Honey be pocket watching she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death slim pickings but Im not impressed
She got the hottest sex so I guess Ima just stay
Staaaaaaaay  Ooohooohoooohooooooh
Ooohooohooooooh oohooooh
Staaaaaaaay Ooohooohoooohooooooh
Ooohooohooooooh oooohoohoh
Even though I dont like you
Next Friday night cant wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you dont fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you you got locked
I felt bad wait do I got love for you
I might kill you but do I got love for you
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but its love what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me I still look twenty
Still get money lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I dont like you near bruh but I need you to stay
Staaaaaaaay  Ooohooohoooohooooooh
Ooohooohooooooh oohooooh
Staaaaaaaay Ooohooohoooohooooooh
Ooohooohooooooh oooohoohoh
