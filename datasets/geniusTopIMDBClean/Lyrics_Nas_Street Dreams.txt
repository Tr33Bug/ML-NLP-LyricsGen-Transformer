Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 Es
A drug dealers destiny is reaching a key
Everybodys looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree
Everybodys looking for something
My man put me up for the share onefourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face now they drew a print
Though Im innocent til proven guilty
Ima try to get filthy purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G Ima fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely Ill build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick this is it
Fresh face NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
Gods sake what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 Es
A drug dealers destiny is reaching a key
Everybodys looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree
Everybodys looking for something


From Fat Cat to Pappy niggas see the cat
Twentyfive to flat push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasnt making me fat snitches on my back
Living with Moms getting it on flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Ninehundredninetynine thou from being rich
But now Im all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter fresh Caesar
Guess David Robinsons Walle moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the droptop BM
Word is bond son I had that bitch down on my shit like this
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 Es
A drug dealers destiny is reaching a key
Everybodys looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree
Everybodys looking for something
Growing up projectstruck looking for luck dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming check what Im seeing
Cars ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
Ging heard about them old timers ODing
Young early 80s throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshiping every word them roperocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes the pushers the addicts everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Aint that funny Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs flipping coke as they career
But Im a rebel stressing to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out spending never holding out
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 Es
A drug dealers destiny is reaching a key
Everybodys looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree
Everybodys looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 Es
A drug dealers destiny is reaching a key
Everybodys looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
