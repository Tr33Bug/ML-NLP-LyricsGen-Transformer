I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
Yo
I never brag how real I keep it cause its the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watchin Kathie Lee  Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezin executioner
Winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxin my bitches they be laughin
They high from sniffin coke off a twentycent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin Sergio Tacchini
Flippin mad pies low price I blow dice and throw them
45 by my scrotum manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3s
Twenty Gods poppin wheelies on Kawasakis
Hiphops got me on some ol sprayin shots like a drum roll
Blankin out never miscount the shells my gun hold
I dont stunt I regulate
Henny and Sprite I separate
Watchin crab niggas marinate
Im all about TECs a good jux and sex
Israelite books holdin government names from Ness
MCs are crawlin out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimps cum
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
For you wack MCs
Currency is made in the trust of the Messiah
Im spendin it to get higher
Earth Wind and Fire singin Reasons why Im
Up early trustworthy as a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill I spill
Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin out  new to my shit home on a furlough
Ask around whos laid up sharp and straight up
Mafioso gettin niggas wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty my life predicted by a gypsy
Ill one day walk into shots drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama Imma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraphs indented
Bloodshot red eyes high
Yellow envelopes of lye
Openin cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tuneproof were lookin out the skys moonroof
Shittin like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coons noose  hang em high
Courtrooms filled up
Its off the hook while I just wrote a statement
Like Im facin twenty years in the basement
Chillin on a VI with Mumia for wearin chrome
I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone Im thrown yo
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
For you wack MCs
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that  Lyrical lylyrical shine 
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
For you wack MCs
Yo the time is wastin I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin court pen pacin
Individual lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation the foulest nation we livin in
Dangerous lives mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin boy
Coke suppliers actin biased
Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gats fired and every day a rats hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani its
Just the killer in me slash drug dealer MC
Exslug filler semi mug peeler
Demi bottles of Mo
Yo simply follow me flow put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and buttholes
Bring the Gs and the Ds roll they cant touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it
My degrees are routed toward the peasy haired brick housing
And studdedup thick medallions
Rich niggas transportin thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin to millions
Doors is locked rocks is chopped watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin mad feelings
Peelin off in a Lex Jeep techniques is fourwheelin
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed word
So now its on never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine take it in blood
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
For you wack MCs
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
I made it like that I bought it like that Im livin like that
For you wack MCs
