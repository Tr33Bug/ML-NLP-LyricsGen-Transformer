Hes the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV so they cant afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto people from the projects street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality
New York girl dem a mad over we
New York girl dem a mad over we
New York girl dem a mad over we

Smoking a escubano guzzle my second bottle
Hope I dont catch a homo grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me search but cant find me
Fuck sadness had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness at me you wouldnt look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next Ill hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli no shirt on convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something thats my word on my body
Ill have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant put lead in your pigment
Just cause yall was mad at all the years I was getting it
In 97 the six 98 the Bentley

Army jacket swag army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps where the gas at
Pass that not you you hold cracks in your ass crack
I never did that my socks where my stash was at
Yo I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat
Now Im the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game looking seventeen
I dont lean no codeine promethazine
I just blow green pick which bitch to bless the king
Although hes on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to raaaahhh
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don

Yeah yeah
New York is like an Island a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding all I hear is sirens
Its all about surviving same old twostep
Try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr so Ima
Keep it on til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love model chocha mami pop it like she pose to
Eyes red shot like Im never sober
Big time smoker Indonesian doja
Mini mes you can hold up
Before you end up wet up from my soldier
Don shit under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto in the hood
Nas the Don Super Cat the Don Dada understood
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don dance
