Fake thug no love you get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low I didnt know til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out Montana way
The Good FELLA verbal AK spray
Dipped attache jump out the Range empty out the ashtray
A glass of Z make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots murder schemes
32 shotguns regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let yall niggas know one thing
Theres one life one love so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin Vegasstyle roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin on millenniums
20 G bets Im winnin em threats Im sendin em
Lex with TV sets the minimum ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains a case of DemiSec
To chase the Henny wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace em fried broiled with basil taste em
Crack the legs way out of formation
Its horizontal how I have em fuckin me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon
Grab your gun its on though
Shit is grimy real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that wont spray right
Dont give a fuck who they hit as long as the dramas lit
Yo overnight thugs bug cause they aint promised shit
Hungryass hooligans stay on that piranha shit
I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
I aint the type of brother made for you to start testin
I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
I aint the type of brother made for you to start testin
I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
I aint the type of brother made for you to start testin
I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death
I aint the type of brother made for you to start testin
I peeped you frontin
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat tinted with heat beats bumpin
Across the street you was wildin
Talkin about how you ran the Island in 89
Layin up playin the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9 that nigga grave be mine
Clanked himwhat was he thinkin
On my corner when its payme time
Dug em you owe me cousin
Somethin told me Plug him
So dumb felt my leg burn then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped son caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name
What the fuck I got stitched up it went through
Left the hospital that same night what
Got my gat back time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown niggas through blazin at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely hear me
So when I rhyme its sincerely yours
Be lightin Ls sippin Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin the raw
But uha thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers  Word up
