Time like Pappy Mason with pens Im embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin in a Sikhs cab or Montero Jeep
I cant call it the beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin but never fallin six feet deep
Im out for presidents to represent me  Say what 
Im out for presidents to represent me  Say what 
Im out for dead presidents to represent me
