Its like a cold story repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind yeah
This shit be real man
Shits crazy out here
Yo yo yo what up yall
Thats my niggas over there word
If you scared to take chances youll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon cock it and pop it His waistband big
But he dont have that thing in him slangin just aint in him
Body language is off hes soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin frontin
Cause he feel a way my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin lame with the milli
Who that over there creepin Who homie by the tree
Better safe than sorry look at pnoid me
Few machine guns close we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell fore they creep on me
Its a lesson every premonition
Lot of niggas killed cause they wasnt payin attention listen
I want a bitch I can trust some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin over my figures I can trust
A lawyer thats fightin for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga trust I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I cant trust you the fuck is you here for
Some of you niggas true colors becomin clear more
Its been so long cant remember how we begun this war
This is a everlasting thunderstorm cause guns went off
I see your moms she still speak
She dont know I aint cool with her son no more
Its old shit see forever we holdin this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef end it with hugs
We buried our dead been years why should I worry bout him
Constantly watchin my back plus niggas tellin I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if Im in the right cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt
Its quite redundant whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas names
I wonder will it change Lets ride


I want a bitch I can trust some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin over my figures I can trust
A lawyer thats fightin for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga trust I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I cant trust you the fuck is you here for
Some of you niggas true colors becomin clear more
Its rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar cant relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down little man let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow lot of dreams folded
Some wasnt humble ate too much got bloated
Aint too much left to buy bought it Im loaded I guess
Lear jets I ask myself do I need love or success
They say the artist that truly suffers his stuff is the best
Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve pain pistols and sex
Remember spray paintin the word fresh and then starin at it
Older folks angry pointin swearin at it
Buildings I sprayed nowadays drive the McLaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric trust your own judgment
Live with it and love it
I want a bitch I can trust some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin over my figures I can trust
A lawyer thats fightin for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga trust I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I cant trust you the fuck is you here for
Some of you niggas true colors becomin clear more
