Yeah
Ayo its poison
Ecstasy coke you say its love it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Niggas up in my hood be gettin shot given poison
In hospitals shots riddle the block
Little children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin mind what is this the hundredth time
Sendin flowers to funerals readin Rest In Peace
You know the usual death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these blackkiller companies is makin money off us
Fast food Cola soda Skull and Bone crosses
Its all poison
Ecstasy coke you say its love it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good given choices
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin hopin that they find a man that will support them
Up late night on they mothers cordless
Thinkin a perm or bleachin cream will make them better when they gorgeous
White girls tannin liposuction
Fake titties are implanted fake lips thats life destruction
Lightskinned women biracial hateful
Toward themselves denyin even they blood
I dont judge Tiger Woods but I
Overstand the mental poison thats even worser than drugs


Yo its poison
Ecstasy coke you say its love it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned it is poison
Physicians prescriptin us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Radio and TV poison
White Jesus poison
And any thoughts of takin me down is poison
Who want beef now My heat shall anoint them plaow
Never to worry
All the wrongdoers got it comin back to em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it comin back to em
Everybody reaps what they sows thats how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken it may get worse
But well get through it yall be strong
The Chinaman built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed em
They call it Thanksgiving I call your holiday Hellday
Cause Im from poverty neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts eryday like Christmas
Slay bitches and party eryday like this is the last
Im with my heckles connectin and we hittin the lab
This is my level fuck if it get you mad
Its all poison
All of my words to enemies it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys its all poison
How could you call yourself MCs You aint poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of takin me down is all poison
Who want beef now My heat shall anoint them plaow
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga  Uh 
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey lightskinned with herpes
Fuckin sisters in Harlem Brooklyn and DC
This is the problem cause he never tell em he got it
From lettin fags suck him off Rikers Island in 93
Drives a Benz hangs at all the parties
All the concerts backstage where the stars be
Rockin they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
Whats your name Where you from
Chain blingin thinkin girls everywhere is dumb
Takin pride in ruinin their lives
So they could never have babies and they could never be wives
He never used a condom give him head He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate believin in karma
Those on top could just break and wont be eatin tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin on niggas dreams
They leave when that nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin dudes thats neglectin they seeds
Instead of takin care of em they spendin money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies cause when them kids get grown
Its too late for you now you old and you gettin shitted on
Its all scientific mystic you know the Earth and the stars
Dont hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bushkiller til George Bush kills me
Much blessings be healthy remember
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
