Yall niggas better not be coming around me with that fugazi no more you know Got that thang for your ass you know
Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna
Im gonna have to leave you 
A vet stylin in Met Gala tuna salad from La Scala
Black sweats swallow a lot of reefer
God it hard to quit the bottom feeder lobster eater
When I fast I see Elijahs features
A million cash for a Nas feature
Nah its cheaper do it for free if you do it for me
52 bar verse if the beat is movin me
Stumble through customs coppin Cubans at the Duty Free
Layin on the most expensive beds still Im losin sleep
Next to Jets Beauty of the Week 1993
Chingrabber neckchoker inhermouthspitter
Blouseripper assgripper that digyouout nigga
I aint gon hold you old head gave me old news
I dont owe you shoulda heard when I told you
You are an extension of what Ive worked hard to build
You believe in your own lies cant be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior I target that
You impressed with what they wearin I started that
Its kinda terrific the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business I woulda thought they was playin
All them niggas I ran with all that weight they was weighin
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz puttin wax in the blunt
The baddest I want she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses you can be mad if you want
Its bubbly til its bubbles we see
Drinkin like Dean Martin is nothin to me
The spirits is somethin I cant part and its fun to be me
So cheers heres to the Kanye production this eve
War of the Roses its war baby
My nigga High said its me I drive em all crazy
Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna
Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna
Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna
