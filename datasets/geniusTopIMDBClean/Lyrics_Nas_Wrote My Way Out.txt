I wrote my way out 
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin on empty thwas nothin left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out
I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst now I write words that try to channel em
No political powerjust lyrical power
Sittin on a crate on a corner sippin for hours
Schemin on a come up from evening to sun up
My man awaitin trial misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers these images still relevant
Flickerin lights inside my project hall
Sickenin the mice crawl all night long
And 87 Reaganism many pages Ive written on
Writin songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom bigger than the crib that I was raised at
Im the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
Im driven black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean
I wrote my way out 
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin on empty there was nothin left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out
I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends I know they miss me
Before the metrocards it was tokens I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life what was a sixteen
At sixteen arrested in housin trip to the mountains
Came right back trappin off couches watchin for mouses
Only tools we was posed with had a spot smoke lit
The hate is just confusion pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldnt afford them I learned everythin on the border
Thats a big 8 Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna now we could get steak
I persevered composition I kept it close
Competition near Im a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin might miss it that window closin
This poetry in motion Im a poet
I wrote my way out 
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin on empty there was nothin left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out
High speed dubbin these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin out of time like Im Jonathan Larsons rent check
My mind is where the wild things are Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal I want it all please give me that pen back
Yall I caught my first beatin from the other kids when I was caught readin
Oh you think you smartBlaowstart bleedin
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains said Psshyoull get em right back
Oversensitive defenseless I made sense of it I pencil in
The lengths to which Id go to learn my strengths and knock em senseless
These sentences are endless so what if they leave me friendless
Damn you got no chill fuckin rightIm relentless
I know Abuelas never really gonna win the lottery
So its up to me to draw blood with this pen hit an artery
This Puerto Ricans brains are leakin through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin beacon this side of the GWB and
Shine a light when its gray out
I wrote my way out 
Oh I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without Im here  Im here 
Cause I wrote my way out
picked up the pen like Hamilton
I wrote my way out of the pro
wrote
wrote my way out of the projects
pick
picked up the pen like Hamilton
I wrote my way out of the
wrote
wrote my way out of the
I wrote my way 
picked up the pen like Hamilton
I wrote my way out of the pro
wrote
wrote my way out of the projects
I wrote my way out 
Really I saw like a hole in the rap game so if I wanted to put my little two cents in the game then it would be from a different perspective
I wrote my way out 
I thought that I would represent for my neighborhood and tell their story be their voice in a way that nobody has done it Tell the real story
