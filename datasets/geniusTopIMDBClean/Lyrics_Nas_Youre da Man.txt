Uh uh
Yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas too real Nas true king
Its however you feel go head you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I dont kill soloists only kill squads
Fame went to they head so now its Fuck Nas
Yesterday you begged for a deal today you tough guys
I seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit its funny I once said
If I ever make a record Ill take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock sleep
I never asked to be top of raps elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Now wait a sec give me time to explain women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal high smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old my flesh rot away
But thatll be the day when its peace
When my gat dont need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for Gods help why they love hurting me
Im your disciple a thug certainly
Im the N the A to the SIR
If I wasnt I mustve been Escobar
45 in my waist staring at my reflection
In the mirror sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a kings throne my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis this is what I changed to
And God Im so thankful


Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man youre the man
Youre the man
