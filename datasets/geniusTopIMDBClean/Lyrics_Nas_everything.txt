Youll live and youll learn
See cause youve never been the same as anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
Youll love and youll learn
See youll never conclude with anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
If I had everything everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything I mean anything
I would change everything oh yeah
Dark boy dont you cry
Theres too much life left in those eyes
Dont you let that face go waterfall
Dont you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy dont you die
Theyre just human let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For youll love in your heart
See cause youve never been the same as anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
This is your call there are no wrongs
See youll never conclude with anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
If I had everything everything
I could change anything I could change anything
If I changed anything I mean anything
I would change everything oh yeah
When the media slings mud we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts merciful beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him harassin him
To my life your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog messiness is not ever the God
Do whats necessary Im never worried
Listen vultures Ive been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
Thats why we competin death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets my Kilimanjaro bone marrows the deepest
You can peep at the comments but dont fall for that
We want freedom Im a scholar an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough
If I had everything everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything I mean anything
I would change everything oh yeah
From the birth of a child the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin child
Should learn to take nothin personal
A parent hates to watch his babys face
Takin his first immunization shots but this is great
The childs introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words nothin is explained
Or rushed to the brain lookin up at his parents face
Like I thought you would protect me from this scary place
Whyd you let them inject me
Whos gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me
If Starbucks is bought by Nestl please dont arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I aint buy no espresso
Soon enough assume the cuffs the position
Not new to us since back on the bus sittin
Said Screw that bus  boycotted that bus outta business
The futures us yet every citizens in prison
If I had everything everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything I mean anything
I would change everything oh yeah
Watch me as I walk through the folly golly New York to Saudi
In Italy Im Eduardo Baccari
But Nasty the hustler nasty like mustard gas sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia no pressure
My first house 11000squarefeet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways black cars and black ice
My second house still in my twenties illin with money
Chilled through my spine spillin wine its funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July bustin in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mobminded
Future Murcilago driver til Lambos got average on me
I started likin the look like I aint had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me just to inspire me
To stay focused its a real sick society
Just cause I got your support dont mean youre buyin me
Im buyin back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived just to say a rapper
Made a change the pantssagger put plans in action
To lay claim the PanAfrican made it happen
Youll live and youll learn
See cause youve never been the same anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
Youll live and youll learn
See youll never conclude with anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
If I had everything everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything I mean anything
I would change everything oh yeah
Dark boy dont you cry
Theres too much life left in those eyes
Dont you let that face go waterfall
Dont you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy dont you die
Theyre just human let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you
For youll love in your heart
See cause youve never been the same as anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
This is your call there are no wrongs
See youll never conclude with anyone else
Dont think the same as everyone else
