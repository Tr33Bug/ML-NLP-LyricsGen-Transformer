My life is changing in so many ways
I dont know who to trust anymore
Theres a shadow running through my days
Like a beggar goin from door to door
I was thinkin that maybe Id get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
Its hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange
And cold
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
When will I see you again
A while ago somewhere I dont know when
I was watchin a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playin a part that I could understand
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid
A man needs a maid
When will I see you again
