Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin
Sayin something about a queen
There were peasants singin and drummers drummin
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the 1970s
I was lyin in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hopin for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin about what a friend had said
I was hopin it was a lie
Thinkin about what a friend had said
I was hopin it was a lie
Well I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flyin
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children cryin and colors flyin
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream all in a dream
The loadin had begun
Flying Mother Natures silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Natures silver seed
To a new home
