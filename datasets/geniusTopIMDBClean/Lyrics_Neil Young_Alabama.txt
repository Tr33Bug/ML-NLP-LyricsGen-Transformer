Oh Alabama
The devil fools with the best laid plan
Swing low Alabama
You got the spare change you got to feel strange
And now the moment is all that it meant
Alabama you got the weight on your shoulders
Thats breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track
Oh Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows down in Alabama
See the old folks tied in white robes
Hear the banjo dont it take you down home
Alabama you got the weight on your shoulders
Thats breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track
Oh Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand
Make friends down in Alabama
Im from a new land I come to you and
See all this ruin what are you doing
Alabama youve got the rest of the Union
To help you along
Whats going wrong
