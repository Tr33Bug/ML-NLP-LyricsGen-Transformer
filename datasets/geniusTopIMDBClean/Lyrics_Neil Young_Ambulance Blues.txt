Back in the old folky days
The air was magic when we played
The Riverboat was rocking in the rain
Midnight was the time for the raid
Oh Isabela proud Isabela
They tore you down and plowed you under
Youre only real with your makeup on
How could I see you and stay too long
All along the Navajo Trail
Burnouts stub their toes on garbage pails
Waitresses are crying in the rain
Will their boyfriends pass this way again
Oh Mother Goose shes on the skids
Shoe aint happy neither are the kids
She needs someone that she can scream at
And Im such a heel for making her feel so bad
I guess Ill call it sickness gone
Its hard to say the meaning of this song
An ambulance can only go so fast
Its easy to get buried in the past
When you try to make a good thing last
I saw today in the entertainment section
Theres room at the top for private detection
To Mom and Dad this just doesnt matter
But its either that or pay off the kidnapper
So all you critics sit alone
Youre no better than me for what youve shown
With your stomach pump and your hook and ladder dreams
We could get together for some scenes
Well Im up in TO keeping jive alive
And out on the corner its half past five
But the subways are empty
And so are the cafes
Except for the Farmers Market
And I still can hear him say
Youre all just pissing in the wind
You dont know it but you are
And there aint nothing like a friend
Who can tell you youre just pissing in the wind
I never knew a man could tell so many lies
He had a different story for every set of eyes
How can he remember who hes talking to
Cause I know it aint me and I hope it isnt you
