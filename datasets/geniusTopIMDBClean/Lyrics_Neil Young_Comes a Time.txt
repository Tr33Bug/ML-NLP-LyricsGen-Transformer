Comes a time when youre driftin
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a light feelings liftin
Lift that baby right up off the ground
Oh this old world keeps spinnin round
Its a wonder tall trees aint layin down
There comes a time
You and I we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right we were giving
Thats how we kept what we gave away
Oh this old world keeps spinnin round
Its a wonder tall trees aint layin down
There comes a time
Oh this old world keeps spinnin round
Its a wonder tall trees aint layin down
There comes a time
There comes a time
Comes a time comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
