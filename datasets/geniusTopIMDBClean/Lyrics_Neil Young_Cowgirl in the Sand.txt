Hello cowgirl in the sand  Hello cowgirl in the sand 
Is this place at your command
Can I stay here for a while
Can I see your sweet sweet smile
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same
Its the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game
Hello ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust
After all the sin weve had
I was hoping that wed turn bad
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same
Its the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game
Hello woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same
Its the woman in you
That makes you want to play this game
