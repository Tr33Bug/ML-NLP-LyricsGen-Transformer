Cripple Creek Ferry Lyrics
Hey, hey, Cripple Creek Ferry
Butting through the overhanging trees
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down, it's a mighty tight squeeze

All alone the captain stands
Hasn't heard from his deck hands
The gambler tips his hat
And walks towards the door
It's the second half of the cruise
And you know he hates to lose
Hey, hey, Cripple Creek Ferry
Butting through the overhanging trees
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down, it's a mighty tight squeezeYou might also likeEmbed
