Hey hey Cripple Creek Ferry
Butting through the overhanging trees
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down its a mighty tight squeeze
All alone the captain stands
Hasnt heard from his deck hands
The gambler tips his hat
And walks towards the door
Its the second half of the cruise
And you know he hates to lose
Hey hey Cripple Creek Ferry
Butting through the overhanging trees
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry
The waters going down its a mighty tight squeeze
