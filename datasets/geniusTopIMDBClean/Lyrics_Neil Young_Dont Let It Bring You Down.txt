Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes
Dont let it bring you down
Its only castles burning
Find someone whos turning
And you will come around
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If youre walking home alone
Dont let it bring you down
Its only castles burning
Find someone whos turning
And you will come around
Dont let it bring you down
Its only castles burning
Just find someone whos turning
And you will come around


Dont let it bring you down
Its only castles burning
Just find someone whos turning
And you will come around
