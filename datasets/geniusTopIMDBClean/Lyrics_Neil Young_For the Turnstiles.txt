All the sailors with their seasick mamas
Hear the sirens on the shore
Singing songs for pimps with tailors
Who charge ten dollars at the door
You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesnt matter
All the great explorers
Are now in granite laid
Under white sheets for the great unveiling
At the big parade
You can really learn a lot that way
It will change you in the middle of the day
Though your confidence may be shattered
It doesnt matter
All the bush league batters
Are left to die on the diamond
In the stands the home crowd scatters
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
For the turnstiles
