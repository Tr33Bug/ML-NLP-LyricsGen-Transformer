Four Strong Winds Lyrics
Think I'll go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are lookin' good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
The good times are all gone
So I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Still, I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change, come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this wayYou might also likeEmbed
