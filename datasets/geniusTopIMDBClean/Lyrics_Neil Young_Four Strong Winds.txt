Think Ill go out to Alberta
Weathers good there in the fall
I got some friends that I could go to working for
Still I wish youd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But weve been through this a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that dont change come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then Im bound for movin on
Ill look for you if Im ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are lookin good
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that dont change come what may
The good times are all gone
So Im bound for movin on
Ill look for you if Im ever back this way
Still I wish youd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But weve been through that a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that dont change come what may
If the good times are all gone
Then Im bound for movin on
Ill look for you if Im ever back this way
Ill look for you if Im ever back this way
