From Hank to Hendrix I walked these streets with you
Here I am with this old guitar doing what I do
I always expected that you would see me through
I never believed in much but I believed in you
Can we get it together Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last like a musical ride
From Marilyn to Madonna I always loved your smile
Now were headed for the big divorce Californiastyle
I found myself singing like a longlost friend
The same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end
Can we get it together Can we still stand side by side
Can we make it last like a musical ride
Sometimes its distorted not clear to you
Sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringing through
New glass in the window new leaf on the tree
New distance between us you and me
Can we get it together Can we still walk side by side
Can we make it last like a musical ride
