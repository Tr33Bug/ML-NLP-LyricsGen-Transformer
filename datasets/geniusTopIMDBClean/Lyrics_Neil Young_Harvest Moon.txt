Come a little bit closer hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping we could dream this night away
But theres a full moon rising lets go dancing in the light
We know where the musics playing lets go out and feel the night
Because Im still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because Im still in love with you
On this harvest moon
When we were strangers I watched you from afar
When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart
But now its getting late and the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate see it shining in your eye
Because Im still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because Im still in love with you
On this harvest moon
Because Im still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because Im still in love with you
On this harvest moon
