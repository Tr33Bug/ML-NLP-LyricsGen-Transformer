I want to live I want to give
Ive been a miner for a heart of gold
Its these expressions I never give
That keep me searchin for a heart of gold
And Im getting old
Keep me searchin for a heart of gold
And Im getting old
Ive been to Hollywood Ive been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
Ive been in my mind its such a fine line
That keeps me searchin for a heart of gold
And Im getting old
Keeps me searchin for a heart of gold
And Im getting old
Keep me searchin for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin and Im growing old
Keep me searchin for a heart of gold
Ive been a miner for a heart of gold
