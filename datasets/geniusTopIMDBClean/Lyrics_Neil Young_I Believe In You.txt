Now that youve found yourself losing your mind
Are you here again
Finding that what you once thought was real
Is gone and changing
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day
How can I place you above me
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I believe in you
Coming to you at night I see my questions
I feel my doubts
Wishing that maybe in a year or two we could laugh
And let it all out
Now that you made yourself love me
Do you think I can change it in a day
How can I place you above me
Am I lying to you when I say
That I believe in you
Oh oh ooh ooh oh oh I believe in you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I believe in you
