Im an accident I was driving way too fast
Couldnt stop though so I let the moment last
Im for rolling Im for tossing in my sleep
Its not guilt though its not the company I keep
People my age they dont do the things I do
They go somewhere while I run away with you
And Ive got my friends and Ive got my family too
And I got her love shes got my love too
And I cant hear you but I feel the things you say
And I cant see you but I see whats in my way
Now Im floating cause Im not tied to the ground
Words Ive spoken seem to leave a hollow sound
On the long plain see the rider in the night
See the chieftain see the braves in cool moonlight
Who will love them when they take another life
Who will hold them when they tremble for the knife
Voicemail numbers on an old computer screen
Rows of lovers parked forever in a dream
Screaming sirens echoing across the bay
To the old boats from the city far away
Homeless heroes walk the streets of their hometowns
And rows of zeros on a field thats turning brown
They play baseball they play football under lights
They play card games and we watch them every night
Need distraction need romance and candlelight
Need random violence need entertainment tonight
Need the evidence want the testimony of
Expert witnesses on the brutal crimes of love


I was too tired to see the news when I got home
Pulled the curtain fell into bed alone
Started dreaming saw the rider once again
In the doorway where she stood and watched for him
Watched for him
Im not present Im a drug that makes you dream
Im an aerostar Im a cutlass supreme
In the wrong lane trying to turn against the flow
Im the ocean Im the giant undertow
Im the ocean
Im the ocean Im the giant undertow
Im the ocean Im the giant undertow
Im the ocean Im the giant undertow
Im the ocean Im the giant undertow
Im the ocean Im the giant undertow
