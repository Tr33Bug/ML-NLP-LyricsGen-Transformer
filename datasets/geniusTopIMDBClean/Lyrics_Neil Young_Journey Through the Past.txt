Journey Through the Past Lyrics
Song without a home

When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey through the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey through the past
And I won't be back 'til February comes
I will stay with you if you'll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll keep good time on a journey through the past

When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?You might also likeEmbed
