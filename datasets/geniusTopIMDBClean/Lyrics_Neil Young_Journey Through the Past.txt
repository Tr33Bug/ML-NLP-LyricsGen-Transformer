Song without a home
When the winter rains come pourin down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if Im fine
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey through the past
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind
Now Im going back to Canada
On a journey through the past
And I wont be back til February comes
I will stay with you if youll stay with me
Said the fiddler to the drum
And well keep good time on a journey through the past
When the winter rains come pourin down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind
