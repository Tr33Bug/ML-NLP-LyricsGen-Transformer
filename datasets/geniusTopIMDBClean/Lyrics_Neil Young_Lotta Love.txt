La la la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Its gonna take a lotta love
To change the way things are
Its gonna take a lotta love
Or we wont get too far
So if you look in my direction
And we dont see eye to eye
My heart needs protection
And so do I
Its gonna take a lotta love
To get us through the night
Its gonna take a lotta love
To make things work out right
So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
Cause my head needs relating
Not solitude
Gotta lotta love
Gotta lotta love
La la la la la la la la la
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Its gonna take a lotta love  It takes a lotta love 
To change the way things are
Its gonna take a lotta love  It takes a lotta love 
Or we wont get too far
Its gonna take a lotta love  It takes a lotta love 
Its gonna take a lotta love
