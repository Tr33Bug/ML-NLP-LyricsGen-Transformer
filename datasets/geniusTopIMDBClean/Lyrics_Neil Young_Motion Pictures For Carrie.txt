Motion Pictures  For Carrie  Lyrics
Motion pictures on my TV screen
A home away from home and Im living in between
But I hear some people have got their dream
Ive got mine
I hear the mountains are doing fine
Morning glory is on the vine
And the dew is fallin
The ducks are callin
Yes Ive got mine
Well all those people
They think they got it made
But I wouldnt buy sell borrow or trade
Anything I have to be like one of them
Id rather start all over again
Well all those headlines they just bore me now
Im deep inside myself but Ill get out somehow
And Ill stand before you
And Ill bring a smile to your eyes
Motion pictures
Motion pictures
