My My Hey Hey  Out of the Blue  Lyrics
My my hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
Its better to burn out than to fade away
My my hey hey
Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this but you pay for that
And once youre gone you can never come back
When youre out of the blue and into the black
The king is gone but hes not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
Its better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone but hes not forgotten
Hey hey my my
Rock and roll can never die
Theres more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey my my
Hey hey my my
