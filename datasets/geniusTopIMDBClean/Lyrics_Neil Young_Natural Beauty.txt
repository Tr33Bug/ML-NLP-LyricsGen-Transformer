On the roller coaster ride
That my emotions have to take me on
I heard a newborn baby cry through the night
I heard a perfect echo die
Into an anonymous wall of digital sound
Somewhere deep inside of my soul
A natural beauty should be
Preserved like a monument to nature
Dont judge yourself too harsh my love
Or someday you might find your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be
Preserved like a monument to nature
Amazon you had so much and now so much is gone
What are you going to do with your life
What a lucky man
To see the earth before it touched his hand
What an angry fool to condemn
One more night to go
One more sleep upon your burning banks
A greedy man never knows what hes done
A natural beauty should be
Preserved like a monument to nature
Dont sell yourself too short my love
Or someday you might find your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be
Preserved like a monument to nature
Went to the rodeo today
I saw the cowgirls lined up on the fence
A brand new Chevrolet
A brand new pair of seamless pants
We watched the moment of defeat
Played back over on the video screen
Somewhere deep inside of my soul


A natural beauty should be
Preserved like a monument
