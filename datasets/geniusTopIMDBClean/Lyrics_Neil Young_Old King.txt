King went arunning after deer
Wasnt scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went asniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog I ever did know
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
There in my truck the dog and I
Then one day the King up and died
Then I thought about the times we had
Once when I kicked him when he was bad
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history
King went arunning after deer
Wasnt scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went asniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog I ever did know
That old King was a friend of mine
Never knew a dog that was half as fine
I may find one you never do know
Cause I still got a long way to go
I had a dog and his name was King
I told the dog about everything
Old King sure meant a lot to me
But that hound dog is history
King went arunning after deer
Wasnt scared of jumping off the truck in high gear
King went asniffing and he would go
Was the best old hound dog I ever did know
