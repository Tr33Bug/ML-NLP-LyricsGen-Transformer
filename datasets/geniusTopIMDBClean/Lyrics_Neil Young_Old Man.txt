Old man look at my life
Im a lot like you were
Old man look at my life
Im a lot like you were
Old man look at my life
Twentyfour and theres so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost such a cost
Give me things that dont get lost
Like a coin that wont get tossed
Rolling home to you
Old man take a look at my life Im a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah one look in my eyes and you can tell thats true
Lullabies look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesnt mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
Ive been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But Im all alone at last
Rolling home to you
Old man take a look at my life Im a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah one look in my eyes and you can tell thats true
Old man look at my life
Im a lot like you were
Old man look at my life
Im a lot like you were
