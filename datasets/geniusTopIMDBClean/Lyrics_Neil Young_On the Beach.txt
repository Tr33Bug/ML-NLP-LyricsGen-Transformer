The world is turning
I hope it dont turn away
The world is turning
I hope it dont turn away
All my pictures are falling
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turning
I hope it dont turn away
I need a crowd of people
But I cant face them day to day
I need a crowd of people
But I cant face em day to day
Though my problems are meaningless
That dont make them go away
I need a crowd of people
I cant face them day to day
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Now Im living out here on the beach
But those seagulls are still out of reach
Went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Get out of town
Think Ill get out of town
Get out of town
Think Ill get out of town
I head for the sticks with my bus and friends
I follow the road though I dont know where it ends
Get out of town get out of town
Think Ill get out of town
Because the world is turning
I dont wanna see it turn away
