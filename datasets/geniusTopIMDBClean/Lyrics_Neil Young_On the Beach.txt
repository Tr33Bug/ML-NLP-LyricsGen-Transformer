On the Beach Lyrics
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
All my pictures are falling
From the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away

I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day to day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face 'em day to day
Though my problems are meaningless
That don't make them go away
I need a crowd of people
I can't face them day to day

I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone
Now I'm living out here on the beach
But those seagulls are still out of reach
Went to the radio interview
But I ended up alone at the microphone

Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
Get out of town
Think I'll get out of town
I head for the sticks with my bus and friends
I follow the road though I don't know where it ends
Get out of town, get out of town
Think I'll get out of town

Because the world is turning
I don't wanna see it turn awayYou might also like1Embed
