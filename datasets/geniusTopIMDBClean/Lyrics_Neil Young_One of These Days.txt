One of these days Im gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends Ive known
Im going to try and thank them all for the good times together
Though so apart weve grown
One of these days Im gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends Ive known
One of these days one of these days
One of these days and it wont be long  It wont be long 
It wont be long  It wont be long 
And Im going to thank that old country fiddler
And all those rough boys who play that rock n roll
I never tried to burn any bridges
Though I know I let some good things go
One of these days Im gonna sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends Ive known
One of these days one of these days
One of these days and it wont be long  It wont be long 
It wont be long  It wont be long 
From down in LA all the way to Nashville
From New York City to my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak some are strong
One of these days Im going to sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends Ive known
One of these days one of these days
One of these days and it wont be long  It wont be long 
It wont be long  It wont be long 
One of these days one of these days
One of these days and it wont be long  It wont be long 
It wont be long  It wont be long 
One of these days one of these days
One of these days and it wont be long  It wont be long 
It wont be long
