Think Ill pack it in and buy a pickup
Take it down to LA
Find a place to call my own and try to fix up
Start a brand new day
The woman Im thinking of she loved me all up
But Im so down today
Shes so fine shes in my mind
I hear her calling
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Cant relate to joy he tries to speak and
Cant begin to say
She got pictures on the wall they make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now Im running down the road trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head
The woman Im thinking of she loved me all up
But Im so down today
Shes so fine shes in my mind
I hear her calling
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Cant relate to joy he tries to speak and
Cant begin to say
