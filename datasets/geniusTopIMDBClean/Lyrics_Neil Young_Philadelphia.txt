Sometimes I think that I know
What loves all about
And when I see the light
I know Ill be all right
Ive got my friends in the world
I had my friends
When we were boys and girls
And the secrets came unfurled
City of brotherly love
Place I call home
Dont turn your back on me
I dont want to be alone
Love lasts forever
Someone is talking to me
Calling my name
Tell me Im not to blame
I wont be ashamed of love
Philadelphia
City of brotherly love
Brotherly love
Sometimes I think that I know
What loves all about
And when I see the light
I know Ill be all right
