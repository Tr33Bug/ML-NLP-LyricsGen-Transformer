Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
Weve never seen
They killed us in our teepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Crying on the ground
But the fire sticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
The taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share
I wish a was a trapper
I would give thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the morning
On the fields of green
In the homeland
Weve never seen
And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
Well sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome
And the first teepee
Marlon Brando Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando Pocahontas and me
Pocahontas
