I got to bet
That your old man
Became fascinated
With his own plan
Turned you loose
Your mama too
There wasnt a thing
That you could do
But I got faith in you
Its a razor love
That cuts clean through
I got faith in you
Its a razor love
That cuts clean through
You really made my day
With the little things you say
Looking through
The window at a silhouette
Trying to find something
I cant find yet
Imagination is my best friend
Got to look out for
The greedy hand greedy hand
Make a living like a rolling stone
On the road
Theres no place like home
Silhouettes on the window
Who was it made
Your eyes flicker like that
Tell me baby
Howd you get the knack
You came to me with open arms
And I really
Took you down the track
Now all Ive got for you
Is the kind of love
That cuts clean through
All I got for you is razor love
It cuts clean through
