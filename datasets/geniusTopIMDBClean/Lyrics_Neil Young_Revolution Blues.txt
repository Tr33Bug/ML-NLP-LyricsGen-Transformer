Well we live in a trailer at the edge of town
You never see us because we dont come around
We got twenty five rifles just to keep the population down
But we need you now and thats why Im hanging around
So you be good to me and Ill be good to you
And in this land of conditions Im not above suspicion
I wont attack you but I wont back you
Well its so good to be here asleep on your lawn
Remember your guard dog Well Im afraid that hes gone
It was such a drag to hear him whining all night long
Yes that was me with the doves setting them free near the factory
Where you build your computer love
I hope you get the connection cause I cant take the rejection
I wont deceive you I just dont believe you
Well Im a barrel of laughs with my carbine on
I keep em hopping till my ammunitions gone
But Im still not happy I feel like theres something wrong
I got the revolution blues I see bloody fountains
And ten million dune buggies coming down the mountains
Well I hear that Laurel Canyon is full of famous stars
But I hate them worse than lepers and Ill kill them in their cars
