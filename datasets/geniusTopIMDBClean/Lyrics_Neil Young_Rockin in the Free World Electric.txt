Rockin in the Free World  Electric  Lyrics
Theres colors on the street
Red white and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
Theres a warning sign on the road ahead
Theres a lot of people saying wed be better off dead
Dont feel like Satan but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Theres an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she put the kid away and shes gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what shes done to it
Theres one more kid thatll never go to school
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder gentler machine gun hand
Weve got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn got roads to drive


Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
Keep on rockin in the free world
