See the Sky About to Rain Lyrics
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain

Some are bound for happiness
Some are bound to glory
Some are bound to live with less
Who can tell your story?
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain

I was down in Dixie Land
Played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man
Broke it down the middle
See the sky about to rain

Ah, ah ah
Ah, ah ah
Ah, see the sky about to rain
See the sky about to rain
Ah, ah ah
Ah, ahYou might also likeEmbed
