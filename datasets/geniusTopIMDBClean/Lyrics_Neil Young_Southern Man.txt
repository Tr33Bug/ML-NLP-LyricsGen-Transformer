Southern man better keep your head
Dont forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man
I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man when will you pay them back
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long How long  Ah 
Southern man better keep your head
Dont forget what your good book says
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man
Lily Belle your hair is golden brown
Ive seen your black man coming round
Swear by God Im gonna cut him down
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long How long  Ah
