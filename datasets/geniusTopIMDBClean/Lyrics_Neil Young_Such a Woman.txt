You are such a woman to me
And I love you
Our love will live
Until the end of all time
No one else can kill me like you do
No one else can fill me like you do
And no no one else can feel our pain
Love is a healer
And I love you
No one else can fill me like you do
No one else can kill me like you do
And I love you
You are such a woman to me
