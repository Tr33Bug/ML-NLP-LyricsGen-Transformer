Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You cant be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though youre thinking that
Youre leavin there too soon
Youre leavin there too soon
Its so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You cant be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though youre thinking that
Youre leavin there too soon
Youre leavin there too soon
Theres a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You cant be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though youre thinking that
Youre leavin there too soon
Youre leavin there too soon
Now youre underneath the stairs
And youre giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And its your first cigarette


Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You cant be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though youre thinking that
Youre leavin there too soon
Youre leavin there too soon
Now you say youre leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Aint it funny how you feel
When youre findin out its real
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You cant be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though youre thinking that
Youre leavin there too soon
Youre leavin there too soon
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You cant be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though youre thinking that
Youre leavin there too soon
