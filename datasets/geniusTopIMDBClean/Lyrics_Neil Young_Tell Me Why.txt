Sailin heart ships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When youre old enough to repay
But young enough to sell
Tell me lies later come and see me
Ill be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When youre old enough to repay
But young enough to sell
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When youre old enough to repay
But young enough to sell
