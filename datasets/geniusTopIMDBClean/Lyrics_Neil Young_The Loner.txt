Hes a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
Hes a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
Hes the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside open wide
Its the loner
If you see him in the subway
Hell be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
Hell know that you are
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside open wide
Its the loner
There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something that he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside open wide
Its the loner
