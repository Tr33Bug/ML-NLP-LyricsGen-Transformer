The Loner Lyrics
He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner
If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner


There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something that he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show

Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the lonerYou might also like2Embed
