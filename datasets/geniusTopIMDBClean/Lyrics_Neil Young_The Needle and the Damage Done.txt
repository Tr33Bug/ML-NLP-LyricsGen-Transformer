I caught you knockin at my cellar door
I love you baby can I have some more
Ooh ooh the damage done
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone gone the damage done
I sing the song because I love the man
I know that some of you dont understand
Milkblood to keep from running out
Ive seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkies like a settin sun
