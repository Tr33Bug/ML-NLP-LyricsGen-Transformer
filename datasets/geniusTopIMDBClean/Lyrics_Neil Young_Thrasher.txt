They were hiding behind hay bales
They were planting in the full moon
They had given all they had
For something new
But the light of day was on them
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water shone like diamonds
In the dew
And I was just getting up
Hit the road before its light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw those thrashers rollin by
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feeling like my day had just begun
Where the eagle glides descending
Theres an ancient river bending
Through the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates
It was then I knew Id had enough
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand
With a oneway ticket to the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends I still dont understand
They had the best selection
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting waiting
So I got bored and left them there
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road without that load
Brings back the time when I was eight or nine
I was watching my mamas TV
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode
Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums
Galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar
But me Im not stopping there
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line in the field of time
When the thrasher comes Ill be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs enshrines
But Ill know the time has come to give whats mine
