Well he shot four men in a cocaine deal
And they left them lyin in an open field
Full of old cars with bullet holes in the mirrors
He tried to do his best but he could not
Please take my advice
Please take my
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes
Well it wasnt supposed to go down that way
But they burned his brother you know
And they left him lying in the driveway
They let him down with nothing
He tried to do his best but he could not
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes
Well tell me more tell me more tell me more
I mean was he a heavy doper or
Was he just a loser
He was a friend of yours
What do you mean he had bullet holes in his mirrors
He tried to do his best but he could not
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes
Please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes
