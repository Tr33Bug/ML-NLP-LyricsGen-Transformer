Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night  Yes it is 
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Well late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long
Tonights the night yes it is
Tonights the night
Tonights the night yes it is
Tonights the night
Early in the morning at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you wont too soon
Cause people let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that hed died out on the mainline
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
Well early in the morning
Just about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon


Tonights the night yes it is
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night oh yes it is
Tonights the night
Oh tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Tonights the night
Whoa
