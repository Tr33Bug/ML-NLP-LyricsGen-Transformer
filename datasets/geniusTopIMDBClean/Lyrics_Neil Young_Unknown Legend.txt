She used to work in a diner never saw a woman look finer
I used to order just to watch her float across the floor
She grew up in a small town never put her roots down
Daddy always kept moving so she did too
Somewhere on a desert highway she rides a HarleyDavidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
Shes been running half her life the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes
You know it aint easy you got to hold on
She was an unknown legend in her time
Now shes dressing two kids looking for a magic kiss
She gets the faraway look in her eyes
Somewhere on a desert highway she rides a HarleyDavidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
Shes been running half her life the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes
Somewhere on a desert highway she rides a HarleyDavidson
Her long blonde hair flying in the wind
Shes been running half her life the chrome and steel she rides
Colliding with the very air she breathes
The air she breathes
