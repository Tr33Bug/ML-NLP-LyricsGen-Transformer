I hear some people been talking me down
Bring up my name pass it round
They dont mention the happy times
They do their thing I do mine
Ooh baby thats hard to change
I cant tell them how to feel
Some get stoned some get strange
But sooner or later it all gets real
Walk on walk on
Walk on walk on
I remember the good old days
Stayed up all night getting crazed
Then the money was not so good
But we still did the best we could
Ooh baby thats hard to change
I cant tell them how to feel
Some get stoned some get strange
Sooner or later it all gets real
Walk on walk on
Walk on walk on
Walk on walk on
