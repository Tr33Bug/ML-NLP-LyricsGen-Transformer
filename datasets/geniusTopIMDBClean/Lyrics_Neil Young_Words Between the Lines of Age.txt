Words  Between the Lines of Age  Lyrics
Someone and someone were down by the pond
Looking for something to plant in the lawn
Out in the fields they were turning the soil
Im sitting here hoping this water will boil
When I look through the window and out on the road
Theyre bringing me presents and sayin hello
Singing words words
Between the lines of age
Words words
Between the lines of age
If I was a junkman selling your cars
Washing your windows and shining your stars
Thinking your mind was my own in a dream
What would you wonder and how would it seem
Living in castles a bit at a time
The King started laughing and talking in rhyme
Singing words words
Between the lines of age
Words words
Between the lines of age
