Open up your eyes see how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in
I was thinkin of you and me making love beneath the tree
And now I wonder could it be
Thinking bout the times we had some were good some were bad
Guitar fighting the TV
I was thinkin about you and me
I was thinkin about you and me
I was thinkin of you and me
I was thinkin about you and me
Looking at you just the other night dancing in the evening light
True love conquers all
Old man sitting there touch of grey but he dont care
When he hears his children call
I was thinkin about you and me
I was thinkin about you and me
I was thinkin of you and me
I was thinkin about you and me
Open up your eyes see how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
