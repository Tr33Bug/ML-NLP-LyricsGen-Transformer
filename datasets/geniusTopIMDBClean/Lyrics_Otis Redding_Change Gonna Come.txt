I was born by a river oh man in this little old tent
Oh just like this river Ive been running ever since
Its been a long long long time coming
But I know but I know a change is gotta come now
Ooh yes it is
On my oh my oh my oh my
Its been too hard living oh my
And Im afraid to die
I dont know whats up there
Beyond the clouds
Its been a long long long time coming
But I know but I know a change is gotta come
Oh yes it is
On my
There was a time I would go to my brother oh my
I asked my brother Will you help me please Oh my oh my
He turned me down and then I ask my dear mother oh
I said Mother
I said Mother Im down on my knees
Its been a time that I thought
Lord this couldnt last for very long oh now oh
But somehow I thought I was still able to try to carry on
Its been a long long long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
