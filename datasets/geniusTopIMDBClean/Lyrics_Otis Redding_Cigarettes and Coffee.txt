Its early in the morning
About a quarter til three
Im sitting here talking with my baby
Over cigarettes and coffee now
And to tell you that
Darling Ive been so satisfied
Honey since I met you
Baby since I met you
All the places that Ive been around
And all the good looking girls Ive met
They just dont seem to fit in
Knowing its particularly sad yeah
But it seems so natural darling
That you and I are here
Just talking over cigarettes and drinking coffee
And oh my heart cries out
Love at last Ive found you oh now
And honey wont you let me
Just build my whole life around you
And while how complete how complete my whole life would be yeah
If you would take things under consideration
And walk down this aisle with me
And I would love it yeah

Over cigarettes and drinking coffee now lord
