Your precious love
Means more to me
Than any love than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you
I was so lonely and so blue
Thats what love thats what love really made me do
And darling oh they keep saying
That our love wont grow now
But honey I wanna tell them
And I just wanna show them
How in the world do they know that
If only all all night long
For as long as youve been in love with me now
I know our love will grow wider
And so deeper
Than any any other seen
Of all the things I want now
In this whole wide world is just
For you to say for you to say
That you will be my my girl now
And I promise I wont leave you
I just keep wanting you all night all night
Im wanting you nobody but you now nobody but you now
Ooh I wanna tell you just one more time
For your precious love now
Oh my
It means everything in the world to me
Everything in the world to me
And Im just so wilding
Just to have you right home with me
