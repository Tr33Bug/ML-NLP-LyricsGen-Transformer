Turn me loose
There aint no use
Free me darling
Dont hang me up
Let me go from your love now
Just like a prisoner
You got me chained and bound
Unlock em Let me go let me go
Get em from around
Turn me loose
There aint no use
Free me baby Let me go Turn me loose
From your love now
You know I did love you yeah
Do anything in the world for you
I try my best I try my very best yeah please
The way your treating me
Keep me in misery
Im so weak Im so weak Im so weak
To walk away
Its up to you
To say were through
Oh free me baby let me go turn me loose baby
From your love
I got to tell you Listen this
I know sometime
I wonder do you really love me
And if you dont if you dont
You got to let me know
Let me go
Your love is not shown
Break these chains
Break them tear them apart
Let me love again

Turn me loose
There aint no use
Let me go darling
If you dont want me
Free me
Let me go
Unchain me
From your love
