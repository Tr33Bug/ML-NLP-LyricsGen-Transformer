I Cant Get No  Satisfaction LyricsI cant get no satisfaction
I cant get no satisfaction
I have tried I have tried
I have tried I have tried
I cant get me no ha ha
I cant get no uh now
When Im driving in my car
And the man talks on the radio
Keep tellin me more and more
About that useless information
Hes tryin to mess up my imagination
And I cant get me no no no
And I cant get me no
Hey hey hey what I say
You gotta gotta gotta groovy
We gotta have it we gotta have it

Keep on grooving keep on grooving

Whatever why wont you wait for time
This little girl is tryin to put me down
I keep on runnin round in my sleep
I keep on messin up any beat
I keep on rockin I try to find me
Somebody to love me
And give me some reaction
And I can find nobody no no nobody
Give me no faction faction
Faction got to have it
Satisfaction we got to have it
Satisfaction earlier in the morning
Satisfaction later in the evening
Satisfaction and dont make my
