Please let me sit down beside you
Ive got something to tell you you should know
I just couldnt wait for not another day
I love you for more than words can ever say
Honey living without you is so painful yeah
I was tempted to call it a day yeah yeah
Youve got me in your hand why cant you understand
I love you baby for more than words can say yeah
I just cant sleep when I lay down in my bed
The thoughts of you babe just linger in my head
Living without you is so painful oh
I was tempted to call it a day
Youve got me in your hand why cant you understand
I love you honey for more than words can say yeah
I love you honey for more than words can say
Yes I do
