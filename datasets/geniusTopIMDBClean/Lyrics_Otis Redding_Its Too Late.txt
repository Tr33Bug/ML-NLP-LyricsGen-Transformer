Wished I had told her
Ooh she was my only one
But its too late its too late
Shes gone
Its too late shes gone now
I know shes gone now
Its too late my babys gone now
I need her loving
Oh more than anyone ooh
But its too late I know its too late
Shes gone
Its a weak man that cry now
So I guess I better
Guess I better dry my weeping eyes now
I need her loving
More than anyone oh
But its too late
It seems like its too late
Shes gone
Shes gone my babys gone
Shes gone oh my baby shes gone
Shes gone my babys shes gone
But where can where can my my baby be
Lord I wonder sometimes
Does she really know
Does she really know
Does she really know when she left me
Oh it hurt my little heart so now
I need your loving
Please dont make me wait
Lord but its too late its too late
Shes gone

I need your loving
Oh more than anyone
Dont let it be too late
No dont let it be too late
But shes gone
Wished I had told her
Ooh she was my only one
Ooh but its too late
I know its too late
Shes gone
Wished I had told her
Oh she was the only one
Please dont let it be too late
No dont let it be too late
