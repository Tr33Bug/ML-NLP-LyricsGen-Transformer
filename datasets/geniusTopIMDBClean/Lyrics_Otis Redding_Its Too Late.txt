Itâ€™s Too Late LyricsWished I had told her
Ooh, she was my only one
But it's too late, it's too late
She's gone
It's too late, she's gone now
I know she's gone now
It's too late, my baby's gone now
I need her loving
Oh, more than anyone, ooh
But it's too late, I know it's too late
She's gone
It's a weak man that cry now
So I guess I better
Guess I better dry my weeping eyes now
I need her loving
More than anyone, oh
But it's too late
It seems like it's too late
She's gone
She's gone, my baby's gone
She's gone, oh my baby, she's gone
She's gone, my baby's she's gone
But where can, where can my my baby be
Lord, I wonder sometimes
Does she really know
Does she really know
Does she really know when she left me
Oh, it hurt my little heart so now
I need your loving
Please don't make me wait
Lord, but it's too late, it's too late
She's gone
You might also likeI need your loving
Oh, more than anyone
Don't let it be too late
No, don't let it be too late
But she's gone
Wished I had told her
Ooh, she was my only one
Ooh, but it's too late
I know it's too late
She's gone
Wished I had told her
Oh, she was the only one
Please don't let it be too late
No, don't let it be too lateEmbed
