Ive got dreams dreams to remember
Ive got dreams dreams to remember
Honey I saw you there last night
Another mans arms holding you tight
Nobody knows what I feel inside
All I know I walked away and cried
Ive got dreams dreams to remember
Listen to me  Ive got dreams  rough dreams  dreams to remember 
I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw him kiss you again and again
These eyes of mine they dont fool me
Why did he hold you so tenderly
Ive got dreams dreams to remember
Listen honey  Ive got dreams  rough dreams  dreams to remember 
I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway
I dont want you to ever leave
Girl you just satisfy me oohwee ooh yeah
I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw you kiss him again and again
These eyes of mine they dont fool me
Why did he hold you so tenderly
Ive got dreams dreams to remember
Listen to me mama  Ive got dreams  bad dreams rough dreams  dreams to remember 
Dont make me suffer  Ive got dreams  rough dreams  dreams  bad dreams  dreams to remember
