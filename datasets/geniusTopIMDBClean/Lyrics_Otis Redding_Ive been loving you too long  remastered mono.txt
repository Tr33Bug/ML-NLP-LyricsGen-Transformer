Ive been loving you too long to stop now
You were tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger as you become a habit to me
Oh Ive been loving you a little too long
I dont want to stop now oh
With you my life
Has been so wonderful
I cant stop now
You were tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair affair grows old
Ive been loving you a little too long long
To stop now
Oh oh oh
Ive been loving you a little bit too long
I dont want to stop now no no no
Dont make me stop now no baby
Im down on my knees please dont make me stop now
I love you I love you
I love you with all of my heart
And I cant stop now
Please please dont make me stop now
