Just One More Day LyricsI've been missing you for so many days
I keep wanting you, lord, in so many ways
I can't get you off of my mind
But true love is so hard to find
I want yet another day
Ooh, I need another day
Darling, let me have another day
And I can be anything that you want me to be, now
The sweet things you used to do to me
Sometimes you used to say them to me
I can't forget those lovely days
But this is the price I am about to pay
Ooh, I want another day
You can let me have just one more day
Ooh, I need one more day, yeah
And I will do anything that you want me to do
I will do anything that you want me to do, now
Say anything that you want me to say
Buy you anything you want me to buy
And I can cherish you till the day I die
If you let me have another day
Please let me have one more day
Ooh, I want just one more day, Lord
And it can be everything that you want me to be
Just one more day now
You can let me have just another day, now
Please I want to stay and the day after and the day after
And I want all the days
I want all the days
I want you here by my side
And I don't want you do leave me
And you can let me have one more dayYou might also likeEmbed
