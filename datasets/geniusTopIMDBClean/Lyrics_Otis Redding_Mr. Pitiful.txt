Mr Pitiful LyricsCall me Mr Pitiful
Baby thats my name now oh
Call me Mr Pitiful
Thats how I got my fame
But people just dont wanna understand that
What make a man feel so blue
Ooh they call me Mr Pitiful
Cause Ive lost someone just like you now
They call me Mr Pitiful
This everybody know now
They call me Mr Pitiful
Most everyplace I go
But nobody seems to understand now
How can a man sing such a sad song
Ooh when he lost everything
When he lost everything that he had
How can I explain to you
How somebody can get so very blue now
How can I tell you about my past
If all things wont end
Mr Pitiful
Thats my name now
They call me Mr Pitiful
Thats how I got my fame
But nobody seems to understand
Oh what make a man can feel so blue now
They call me Mr Pitiful
Cause Im in love with you
Can I explain to you
Everything is going wrong
Ive lost everything veI had
I have to sing these sad songs to get back to her
And I want you and I want you and I want you
And I want you and I wanna tell you that now
That everything is going through my mind
And I wanna sing
And I dont wanna sing this song with you
And Im gonna sing this song for everybody
Cause I want them to understand what I talkin about
I want you to understand what Im sayin
