Mr. Pitiful LyricsCall me Mr. Pitiful
Baby, that's my name now, oh
Call me Mr. Pitiful
That's how I got my fame
But people just don't wanna understand that
What make a man feel so blue
Ooh, they call me Mr. Pitiful
'Cause I've lost someone just like you, now
They call me Mr. Pitiful
This everybody know, now
They call me Mr. Pitiful
Most everyplace I go
But nobody seems to understand, now
How can a man sing such a sad song
Ooh, when he lost everything
When he lost everything that he had
How can I explain to you?
How somebody can get so very blue, now
How can I tell you about my past?
If all things won't end
Mr. Pitiful
That's my name, now
They call me Mr. Pitiful
That's how I got my fame
But nobody seems to understand
Oh, what make a man can feel so blue, now
They call me Mr. Pitiful
'Cause I'm in love with you
Can I explain to you?
Everything is going wrong
I've lost everything 'veI had
I have to sing these sad songs to get back to her
And I want you and I want you and I want you
You might also likeAnd I want you and I wanna tell you that now
That everything is going through my mind
And I wanna sing
And I don't wanna sing this song with you
And I'm gonna sing this song for everybody
'Cause I want them to understand what I talkin' about
I want you to understand what I'm sayin'Embed
