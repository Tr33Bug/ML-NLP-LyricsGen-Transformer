Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day
And its cold outside Ive got the month of May
Oh I guess youd say
What can make ooh me feel this way
Its my girl
Talkin bout my girl
Ive got so much loving oh the bees envy me
Ive got a sweeter song that I can sing than the birds in the trees
Oh I guess you will say
Ooh what can make me feel this way
Its my girl
Talkin bout my girl ooh hoo
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh ooh yeah
I dont need no money all I need is my fame
Ive got all the riches baby one big man can claim
Oh I guess youd say
Ooh What can make you feel this way
My girl
Talkin bout my girl
Ooh Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day with my girl
Ive even got the month of May with my my my girl
Talkin bout talkin bout talkin bout ooh ooh ooh
