This is my lovers prayer
I hope itll reach out to you my love
This is my lovers prayer
And I hope you can understand it my love
My life is such a weary thing
But it might be old pressure bringing rain
You keep me wanting waiting and wishing
When I know deep down Im not to blame
What you gonna do tonight
When you need some lovin arms to hold you tight
Tell me what you gonna do tonight
When you need my heavy voice to tell you goodnight
Honey but you cant let that be no problem
Youve got to come on home and help me solve em
Then I wont be missing you
And honey my lovers prayer would be all over oh my
What can the matter be now
It cant be too serious we cant talk it over
Living in this misery darling
You cant make my life all over
Honey but dont you let that be no problem
Just come on home and help me solve em
Then I wont be missing you I wont be missing you
And my lovers prayer would be all over
It got to be all over honey all over
Dont keep my life going round in so many circles
This is my lovers prayer come on come on come on home
This is my lovers prayer
Im singing out to you and I hope it will reach you darling
This is my lovers prayer I hope to get the message to you
