Nobody Knows You When Youâ€™re Down And Out Lyrics
Once I lived the life of a millionaire
People spending my money
Honey, know that I just didn't care now, no
Taking my friends out trying to have a good time
We'd drink that spoiled bootleg liquor, huh
And that good old champagne and wine
But oh, just as soon as my money got so low
I couldn't find my friends, Lord
And I just didn't have no place to go now, no
But if I ever
And if I ever get my hands on them green dollars again, yeah
I'm gonna hold on 'til that big eagle grins
I'm tryin' to tell y'all that nobody wants you, huh
People, nobody wants you When you're down and out

Because in your pocket
No, there is not one penny
And all of them so-called friends
I'm tryin' to tell y'all that you haven't got any
But, uh, huh, yeah
And just as soon as you get back on your feet again
People, I'm tryin' to tell you that here they come
Telling you all of your long lost friends now, oh
But I'm tryin' to tell everybody, Lord, without a doubt

That nobody wants you, oh
Nobody wants you, no, no
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out, Lord
And nobody have a good thing about you
And nobody can tell you when to turn and when to go
But there is, ha, but
But when you get back on your feet again
Then everybody try to tell you all day long...You might also likeEmbed
