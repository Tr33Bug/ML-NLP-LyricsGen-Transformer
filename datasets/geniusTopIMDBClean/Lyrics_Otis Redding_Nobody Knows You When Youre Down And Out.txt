Once I lived the life of a millionaire
People spending my money
Honey know that I just didnt care now no
Taking my friends out trying to have a good time
Wed drink that spoiled bootleg liquor huh
And that good old champagne and wine
But oh just as soon as my money got so low
I couldnt find my friends Lord
And I just didnt have no place to go now no
But if I ever
And if I ever get my hands on them green dollars again yeah
Im gonna hold on til that big eagle grins
Im tryin to tell yall that nobody wants you huh
People nobody wants you When youre down and out
Because in your pocket
No there is not one penny
And all of them socalled friends
Im tryin to tell yall that you havent got any
But uh huh yeah
And just as soon as you get back on your feet again
People Im tryin to tell you that here they come
Telling you all of your long lost friends now oh
But Im tryin to tell everybody Lord without a doubt
That nobody wants you oh
Nobody wants you no no
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when youre down and out Lord
And nobody have a good thing about you
And nobody can tell you when to turn and when to go
But there is ha but
But when you get back on your feet again
Then everybody try to tell you all day long
