If I go a million miles away
Ill write a letter
Each and every day now
Oh honey nothing nothing nothing
Nothing is ever gonna change this love I have for you
No no no no
You you can make me weep
But you can make me moan
Tell me you just got back darling
Ill just say Well welcome home
For honey nothing
Nothing in this world
Could ever stop this love
Could ever stop this love I have for you
Oh no oh no
Oh youre the apple of my eye
My sweet little cherry pie
Darling you can be my cake and ice cream
Sugar and spice everything nice
You can be the girl of my dreams
If you would only meet me at home
When you get back when you get back
Ill just say Well welcome home now
Oh my darling nothing nothing nothing
Nothing could ever change
This love I have for you oh now oh now
