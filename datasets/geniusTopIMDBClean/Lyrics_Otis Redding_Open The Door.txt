Ive been so wrong so many times
And you know what Im talkin about
Weve all been wrong a time in our life
And we all make mistakes sometimes of leaving whats good for us
I made that mistake and now Im tryin to get back to my baby
This runnin round sure nough is killin me
Let me let me in
Let me in let me in
Let me in let me in
Let me in let me in let me in let me in let me ease on in
Look into my eyes
Cant you see I got to come on in
I aint lyin and I aint smilin bout it baby
Open the door or Im bustin in
Because this runnin around
Sure nough sure nough is killin me
Yes it is its killin me baby
I got to come on in
Let me in baby please let me in
I got to come on in honey
Open the door
Open the door
Let me in let me in let me in let me ease on in
Mama mama got to come in
Open the door
I cant stand this cold
Let me in this house
Im tired of this runnin around
Tired of being tired of being all alone
Standing out here and walkin with walkin with
Or walkin with someone
Im tired of just being out here
Im tired of being out here its cold
Open the door open the door
