Pain in my heart shes treating me cold
Where can my baby be Lord no one knows
Pain in my heart just wont let me sleep
Where can my baby be Lord where can she be
Another day has began to get tough
Said I want you to come back come back come back baby
Till I had enough oh
A little pain in my heart just wont let me be
I wake up at restless nights Lord and I cant even sleep
Mmm hmm yeah
Another day has began to get rough
Said I want you to love me love me love me baby
Until I get enough oh
Pain in my heart
A little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Someone stop this pain
Someone stop this pain oh
