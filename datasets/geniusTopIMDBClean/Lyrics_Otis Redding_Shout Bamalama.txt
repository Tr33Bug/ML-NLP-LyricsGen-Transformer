Shout Bamalama Lyrics
Bamalama, okay, hold it, hold it right there
Hold it, hold it
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four

He's down in Alabama
I'm shoutin' Bamalama
Way down in Louisiana
Well, well, well
Nobody's gonna set him down
Lord have mercy on my soul
How many chickens have I stole
One last night and the night before
I'm going back and tryin' to get ten or 'leven more
Startin' to get 'em and I
I love a chicken, baby
Shoutin' Bamalama
Well, well, well
Nobody's gonna set him down

9 feet and 10 feet we're goin' for the build
An' 9 feet left on a ten feet of hill
10 feet turn around a 9 feet fence
His teeth fell out and his tongue stayed in
His cousin said so
He got the chicken, baby
Shoutin' Bamalama
Well, well, well
Nobody's gonna set him down

A Leo demarket told a line one day
A bad little fella comin' down the way
We were talkin' 'bout his family, it's a cryin' shame
He tell ya, "Mother is workin' on the chain gang"
You might also likeShe busts his britches now
She's good at workin' hard
Shoutin' Bamalama
Well, well, well
Nobody's gonna set him down

The preacher and the deacon were prayin' one day
Along come a bear comin' down that way
The preacher told the deacon to say a prayer
He said, "Lord, a prayer won't kill this bear"
I gotta make it, baby
Shout Bamalama
I gotta run for it
Well, well, well
Nobody's gonna set him down
He's down in AlabamaEmbed
