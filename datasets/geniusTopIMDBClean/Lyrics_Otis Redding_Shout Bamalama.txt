One last night and the night before
Im going back and tryin to get ten or leven more
Startin to get em and I
I love a chicken baby
Shoutin Bamalama
Well well well
Nobodys gonna set him down
9 feet and 10 feet were goin for the build
An 9 feet left on a ten feet of hill
10 feet turn around a 9 feet fence
His teeth fell out and his tongue stayed in
His cousin said so
He got the chicken baby
Shoutin Bamalama
Well well well
Nobodys gonna set him down
A Leo demarket told a line one day
A bad little fella comin down the way
We were talkin bout his family its a cryin shame
He tell ya Mother is workin on the chain gang
She busts his britches now
Shes good at workin hard
Shoutin Bamalama
Well well well
Nobodys gonna set him down
The preacher and the deacon were prayin one day
Along come a bear comin down that way
The preacher told the deacon to say a prayer
He said Lord a prayer wont kill this bear
I gotta make it baby
Shout Bamalama
I gotta run for it
Well well well
Nobodys gonna set him down
Hes down in Alabama
