Sittin On  The Dock of the Bay Lyrics
Sittin in the mornin sun
Ill be sittin when the evenin come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch em roll away again yeah
Im sittin on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh Im just sittin on the dock of the bay
Wastin time
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco bay
Cause Ive had nothing to live for
And look like nothins gonna come my way
So Im just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh Im sittin on the dock of the bay
Wastin time
Look like nothings gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I cant do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess Ill remain the same yes
Sittin here resting my bones
And this loneliness wont leave me alone
Its two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
Now Im just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Oohwee sittin on the dock of the bay
Wastin time
Whistling
