When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only
Only light we see
No I wont be afraid
No no no no no no
No I wont be afraid
Just as long just as long
Just as long as you stand by me
Now darling darling
Whenever Im in trouble
Darling wont you stand
I need just a little helping hand
Now now now
And darling darling
Wont you stand by me
If the sky we look upon now now
Should tumble and fall
All of the mountains may crumble
May crumble to the sea
I wont cry I wont cry
No no no no no I wont shed no tears
Just as long just as long
Just as long as you stand by me
Now darling darling

Need someone to come pick me up
And let you stand by me
