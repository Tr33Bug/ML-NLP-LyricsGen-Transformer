If I was the sun way up there
Id go with love most everywhere
Ill be the moon when the sun goes down
Just to let you know that Im still around
Thats how strong my love is whoa
Thats how strong my love is
Thats how strong my love is baby baby
Thats how strong my love is
Ill be the weeping willow drowning in my tears
And you can go swimming when you are here
And Ill be the rainbow after the tears are gone
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm
Thats how strong my love is darling
Thats how strong my love is baby
Thats how strong my love is whoa
Thats how strong my love is
Ill be the ocean so deep and wide
And catch all the tears whenever you cry
Ill be the breeze after the storm is gone
To dry your eyes and love you all warm
Thats how strong my love is baby
Thats how strong my love is now
Thats how strong my love is darling
Thats how strong my love is again now
Thats how strong my love is so deep and wide
Thats how strong my love is
So much to love yes so much to love whoa
Theres so much love theres so much love
Anything the sun can do I will do it for you
Any kind of love you want Ill be with you
