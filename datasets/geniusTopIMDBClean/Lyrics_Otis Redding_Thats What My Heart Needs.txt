Thatâ€™s What My Heart Needs Lyrics
You left me for another
You told me he was your lover
So I'm begging and I'm pleading
And I'm down on bended knee, oh baby
That's what my heart needs

Baby, oh baby
I'm calling you out loud and clear, baby
Oh baby
I love you, yes I do
And I want to be with you, oh baby
That's what my heart needs
Darling, my my darling
I need you here right by my side, baby, darling
If you hadn't left that day
Then my love wouldn't be this way, oh baby
That's what my heart needs

Come on, baby
I said I need you right here by my side
I said I need you, baby
I need you here to protect me and be my guide
And oh, baby, yeah, yeah, baby
I know you don't know what I mean, baby
Oh, baby, yeah, hey baby
Hey, hey baby
Come on, come on and love me, baby, Lord
Come on, come on and be right by my side
Hey, come on, yeah, yeah, baby...You might also likeEmbed
