You left me for another
You told me he was your lover
So Im begging and Im pleading
And Im down on bended knee oh baby
Thats what my heart needs
Baby oh baby
Im calling you out loud and clear baby
Oh baby
I love you yes I do
And I want to be with you oh baby
Thats what my heart needs
Darling my my darling
I need you here right by my side baby darling
If you hadnt left that day
Then my love wouldnt be this way oh baby
Thats what my heart needs
Come on baby
I said I need you right here by my side
I said I need you baby
I need you here to protect me and be my guide
And oh baby yeah yeah baby
I know you dont know what I mean baby
Oh baby yeah hey baby
Hey hey baby
Come on come on and love me baby Lord
Come on come on and be right by my side
Hey come on yeah yeah baby
