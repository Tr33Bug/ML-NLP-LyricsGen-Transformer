These arms of mine
They are lonely
Lonely and feeling blue
These arms of mine
They are yearning
Yearning from wanting you
And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh how grateful I will be
These arms of mine
They are burning
Burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting
Wanting to hold you
And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh how grateful I will be
Cmon cmon baby
Just be my little woman
Just be my lover oh
I need me somebody
Somebody to treat me right oh
And I need your arms loving arms
To hold me tight
And III need I need your
I need your tender lips
To hold me
