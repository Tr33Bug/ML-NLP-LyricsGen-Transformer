These Arms of Mine Lyrics
These arms of mine
They are lonely
Lonely and feeling blue
These arms of mine
They are yearning
Yearning from wanting you

And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I will be
These arms of mine
They are burning
Burning from wanting you
These arms of mine
They are wanting
Wanting to hold you

And if you
Would let them hold you
Oh, how grateful I will be

C'mon, c'mon baby
Just be my little woman
Just be my lover, oh
I need me somebody
Somebody to treat me right, oh
And I need your arms, loving arms
To hold me tight
And I-I-I need, I need your
I need your tender lips
To hold me...You might also like1Embed
