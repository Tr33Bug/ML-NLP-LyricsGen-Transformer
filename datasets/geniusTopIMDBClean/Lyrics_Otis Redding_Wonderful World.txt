I Dont know much about history
Dont know much about biology
Dont know much about the science book
Dont know much about the French I took
All I do know is I love you
And I wonder  if you love me too
Ooh what a wonderful world this gonna be
I dont know much about geography
Dont know much about trigonometry
Dont know much about the algebra
Dont know what a slide rule is for
All I do know one and one is two
And I wonder if you love me too
What a wonderful world this gonna be
Now I dont claim to be an A student
But thats what Im trying to be
But by being an A student baby
Look like I can win your love for me
Dont know much about the history now
Dont know much about biology
I dont know much about the science book
Dont know much about the good French I took oh
What I do know is I love you
And I wonder if you love me too
Ooh what a wonderful world this could be
Good God I dont claim to be an A student
But thats what Im trying to be
But if I have to be an A student baby
Im gonna win no love for me
I dont know much about geography
Dont know much trigonometry
Dont know much about the algebra
Dont know what a good slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two
And I wonder if you love me too
What a wonderful world this gonna be
Cha cha cha cha cha
Ive been trying Ive been trying Ive been trying
