In the beginning you really loved me
I was too blind I could not see now
But now that youve left me
Oh how I cried out I keep crying
You dont miss your water till your well run dry
I kept you crying sad and blue oh my
I was a playboy I just wouldnt be true
But now that you left me
Good Lord how I cried I keep crying I keep crying
Ive been missing my water
No I never missed my water till my well run dry
I sit here and wonder
How in the world this could be my oh my
I never thought oh I never thought youd ever leave me
But now that youve left me
Good Lord good Lord how I cried out
You dont miss your water
You dont miss your water till your well run dry
You dont miss your water
You dont miss your water till your well run dry
I miss my water
I keep missing my water
I keep missing my water
And I want my water
I need my water
I love my water
And I want my water
And I am little thirsty now
And Iam little thirsty now
I want my water
I need wanting my water
