Your Love Has Lifted Me  Higher  Higher Lyrics
Your love keeps lifting me higher
Than Ive ever been lifted before
So give me love which is my desire honey
Im gonna be at your side forevermore
Now you know your love keeps lifting me higher
Than Ive ever been lifted before
So give me love oh which is my desire
Im gonna be at your side forevermore
Now I was once down and broken hearted
And disappointment was my closest friend
And then you you came in heated hearted
And you know he never showed his face again
Now you know your love keeps lifting me higher
Than Ive ever been lifted before
So give me love which is my desire
Im gonna be at your side forevermore
Know your love lifting me higher
Than Ive ever been lifted before
So give me love which is my desire
Im gonna be at your side forevermore
Now you know your love keeps lifting me higher
Than Ive ever been lifted before
So give me love which is my desire honey
Im gonna be at your side forevermore
Oh Ive got to tell you bout it
Keep me lift me on up lift me
Lift me little higher now keep me going all up
I wanna higher higher higher higher
Get me up there I gotta get on up there
Lift me lift me lift me lift me
Keep on lifting me up up up up up up
Gotta get on up gotta gotta get on up there
Lift a little little bit
