Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential levelwhat are we doing
Fooling ourselves clowning ourselves playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We cant babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we cant get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture thats painted
Tainted as the mind whos blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mindnumbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and dont look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon
Like memories of yesterday
Ninetysix gonna be that year
Ninetysix gonna be that year
Ninetysix gonna be that year
Ninetysix gonna be that year
I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see theyre making their paper so I guess I cant complain
Or can I I feel theyre disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving aint tasting right
My stomach cant digest it even when I bless it
Im confessing one more lesson from the South we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go head and diss it while real hophippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
Uhh born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
Its the nigga the BIG be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
Im thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew thinking theyre robbing you you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems Im reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Dont expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust us we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin niggas dippin
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
Our dearly beloved we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh like Liberty Bells yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we aint gon stop until we hit the big screen
Psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
So we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old
Like some eagles people dont understand
Just like their parents dont be caring
Im speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it get it but you aint pimping no bitches
Cause you flauging falling like leaves into driveways
Isnt it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old
Somethings gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
See all them leaves must fall down growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellowbrown
Autumn caught em see all them leaves must fall down growin old
See all them leaves must fall down growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellowbrown
Autumn caught em see all them leaves must fall down growin old
See all them leaves must fall down growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellowbrown
Autumn caught em see all them leaves must fall down growin old
