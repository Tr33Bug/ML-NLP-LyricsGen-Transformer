Well its the MIcrooked letter aint no one better
And when Im on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
Cause Im cooler than a polar bears toenails
Oh hell there he go again talking that shit
Bend corners like I was a curve I struck a nerve
And now you bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard its not where youre from but where you pay rent
Then I heard its not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows amongst other things but Im not worried
Cause when we step up in the party like a mouse you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax BIG BOI
Its that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try to warn you not to test but you dont listen
Giving the shoutout to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
Now my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender aint nothing better
Let me know when its wet enough to enter
If not Ill wait because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone
Or will it feel that if we tune it it just might get picked on
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone
They alienateus cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach aint no lie
Ill be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker breaker 104 can I get some reply
Now everybody say
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer


Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like ES to the PN cause we adjust to the beat in the zone  zone 
Honey Im home but Im not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now Im sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team and like your daddys wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens so back the hell up off me
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The worlds a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so Im ready for war okay
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just dont care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say OYeayer
