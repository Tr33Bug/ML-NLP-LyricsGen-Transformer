Stay in your little hole then coward duck your head
You dont know who you be fucking with yous better off
Dead is what I say best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown yall can break now
My kitchen full of heat if you cant take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around dont be getting yall nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck bullets fly niggas die
By getting blasted how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw I take that back thats my problem
Turning and walking away
This aint gon work when they be robbing
As long as Big Bois still living never standing by my lonesome
Step up nigga if you want some
Aint no thang but a chicken wang
Wes having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
Its just a pimps  players  Mack daddies  East Point

Original ghetto bastard so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope but in 1994
Im making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect cause wes gon be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah it was so hard to say goodbye Im a man now
Im at the end of my street so its time to take my stand now
I call the wild because its time to take the streets
So if you aint got the vertebrae or big enough nuts retreat
Im ready to wet em up like cereal
Just an international playa coming through your stereo
Aint no thang but a chicken wang
Wes having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
Its just a pimps  players  Mack daddies  East Point 
Its all about that cess in yo chest  Its the joint 
Aint no thang but a chicken wang
Wes having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane

Therell be mo dead cause Im a pro kid
But Lord forgive me I gots to keep my Milli right Vinear me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me
Off my street but in my hoodhood they hollering ghetto
Dont got no neighbors they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Aint shit that we can do but rest in peace pour a brew
On the concrete remember when we ran deep
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy
They know not to test us test me do me try me
Tripping with that drama my Berettas right beside me
One is in the air and one is in the chamber
Yall ask me what the fuck Im doing Im releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger Im taking it one day
At a time I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre Ill take it to the HoJo bitch
Just to let you know yeah

Its on my friend on the road again Im traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
Id do it if I have to busting caps with this a heater
Load it clip up after clip Im packing my gauge if I feel it
The Glock the gat the nine the heaters
See I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you
You posed to be the quickest draw but man I hail em faster
123 you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips Ill send you to an early grave
You fucking slave you better try another way
To take me out is truly something difficult
Dont even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
Im out of bullets letting loose my last clip
Ima kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
Yeah thats how I do
You know thats how I do you know thats how I do
Aint no thang but a chicken wang
