Yuh
Uhhuh
Even the Sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes Y
Nothing is for sure nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever but until they close the curtain
Yall know 
Its him and I Aquemini
Yeah
Now is the time to get onlike Spike Lee said Get on the Bus
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpingits a must
Is you on that dust or corn starch Familiar with that smack man
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sackman
Pacman how in the fuck you think we gon do that man
Riding round Old National on eighteens without no gat man
Im strapped man and ready to bust on any nigga like that man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you aint got no rims nigga dont get no woodgrain steering wheel for real  Real 
You can go on and chill out and still build
Let your paper stack stead of going into overkill
And pay your fuckin beeper bill bitch
Yeah
Yuh yuh  Yeah 
Even the Sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes Y
Nothing is for sure nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever but until they close the curtain
Its him and I Aquemini


Twice upon a time there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after but thats another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors baby ballers bowlingball Impalas
Street scholars majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese and dough from scratch
But see the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling what you bought so cut that big talk
Lets walk to the bridgemeet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
Its them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
Its looking bad
Need some hope like the words maybe if or probably
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly they dont fall
Im sorry yall I often driftIm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Dont want to be it but its needed so what have you
Now question Is every nigga with dreads for the cause
Is every nigga with golds for the fall
Naww so dont get caught up in appearance
Its OutKast Aquemini another Black experience
Okay
Even the Sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes Y
Nothing is for sure nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever but until they close the curtain
Its him and I Aquemini
The name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that some say we proBlack but we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks you bust round we bust back
GGet back for real niggas thats out here tryna spit facts
You ear that You cant come near that maybe you need to quit  Quit 
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and the Gemini running shit
Like this yeah yeah yeah yeah
My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andr Ben welcome to the lions den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make itthats the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again cause I swear I spot one every now and then
Its happening again wish I could tell you when
Andr this is Andr yall are just gon have to make amends
Even the Sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes Y
Nothing is for sure nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever but until they close the curtain
Its him and I Aquemini
