BOB Lyrics
One two
One two three yeah
Inslumnational underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground  Whoo 
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
You cant stop the train
Who want some dont come unprepared
Ill be there but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin us it aint gon rain
So now we sittin in a droptop soakin wet
In a silk suit tryin not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But thisll be the year that we wont forget
1999 Anno Domini anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig I might just touch hellhot
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm  Hammer
Soulgold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home things are wrong
Well not really it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello ghetto let your brain breathe
Believe theres always more ha
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Uno dos tres its on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac bout five niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
Cause we get crunk stay drunk at the club
Shouldve bought an ounce but you copped a dub
Shouldve held back but you throwed the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl fouryearJordan
Never turned my back on my kids for them
Shouldve hit it quit it ragtop
Before you reup get a laptop
Make a business for yourself boy set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four but we on a roll
Hold up slow up stop Control
Like Janet Planet Stankonias on ya
Moving like Floyd comin straight to Florida
Lock all your windows then block the corridors
Pullin off my belt cause a whippings in order
Like a threepiece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell then I hit the border
Pittypat rappers trying to get to five
Im a microphone fiend tryin to stay alive
When you come to ATL boy you better not hide
Cause the Dungeon Family gon ride ha


Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Dont pull the thang out unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah dont even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Bombs over Baghdad
Bombs over Baghdad
Bombs over Baghdad
Bombs over Baghdad
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
Bob your head ragtop
