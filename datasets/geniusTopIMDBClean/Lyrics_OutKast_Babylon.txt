I came into this world high as a bird
From secondhand cocaine powderI know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but its in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snapback
And bitches they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route turn each other out burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me cant even get no backrub these days
Aint that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down cause they shut you down when you speak from your heartnow thats hard
While we ranting and raving bout gats
Nigga they made them gats they got some shit thatll blow out our backs from where they stay at
Ooooh I fear the battles just begun
Ooooh though were here someday we will be gone
So Im hoping  Hoping  wishing  Wishing  praying
To keep my faith in you  Keep my faith 
In you in you
Im fascinated by the way your nipples peak at me through your blouse
Freaky me freaky you cant help but be aroused
Scuse me Lord lustful thinking but thats the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During PE wed be exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on until we felt excited then  Aaaah 
Oh now its on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what Im talking about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and Ill see you on the next song
They call it horny because its devilish now see we dead wrong
Ooooh I fear the battles just begun
Ooooh though were here someday we will be gone
So Im hoping wishing praying
To keep my faith in you  Keep my faith in you 
In you  Oh ooh 


People dont know the stress Im dealing with day to day  Day 
Speaking about the feeling Im possessing for Renee
Moping around and wondering where she stay saw her last that she lay
Give it another day I say but the Lord he taketh away
Now give it back Lord cause thats like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store crack cocaine pimps and whores
Living up on this earth before a nigga like Daddy was born
But they be making it seem that my music and crime are a team
But Im speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean my lyrics aint clean
Ooooh I fear the battles just begun
Ooooh though were here someday we will be gone  So I keep hoping 
So Im hoping wishing praying  Praying 
To keep my faith in you  Keep my faith in you 
In you
Ooooh I fear the battles just begun
Ooooh though were here someday we will be gone
So Im hoping wishing praying
To keep my faith in you  My faith in you 
In you
Ooooh I fear the battles just begun
Ooooh though were here someday we will be gone  I keep hoping 
So Im hoping wishing praying
To keep my faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you  Keep my faith 
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith
