Something I cant handle
Yo unkay
Yo this is my story this is my song
And to them rudypoots dont attempt to try this at home
Its just a poem until yall learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation when to grab the chrome
But its back on another stormy night in Atlanta Georgia
Overcast but on behalf of OutKast I cordially
Invite you to an emotionfilled theater
Bring your umbrellas cause young fella it gets no weirder
We reign reign supreme preme
Dungeon dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats mice snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
Now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats mice snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
Now now just hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride
You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High yeah yeah my Lord
To make one bob they head would be the track job
Your jobs to spit that fire
Some of yall MCs take this rhymin for granted I wont comply
With that slackin poppin and crackin fourth ward say we snappin
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
Whats happenin see if do what you wont do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you cant even live cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin when I see you nigga you packin
Understand that though you behind a 75000 car doe
But still stay with mom though playing the King like Don doe
You choked up you was the nigga that supposed to be so locced up
Makin them think Hip Hop is dead exhume the body if you aint scared
And if I see you in the streets Id dap you down like you was Greg yeah


We reign reign supreme preme dungeon dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats mice snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
Now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats mice snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
Now now just hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats mice snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
Now hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats mice snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire spliced with rock nroll indubitably piper pied
Now now just hold on my brother no no no no cant stop the stride
