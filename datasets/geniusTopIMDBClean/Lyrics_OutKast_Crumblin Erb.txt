Yessuh let me dig into your brain folks falling like rain
Poverty got me selling thangs guess Im gon explain
Jane is rolled up no gangs be throwed up
But still Andr got action they Sweat like Keith all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine thinking that you gots
Ample time to do this have you shot I thought you knew this
Im crumbling no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks watching my back
Wetting em up like splish leaving em in a splash
Of blood the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
Im putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less bet be ready
When they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest and
Yous gone up outta here for good
Yall be bobbin back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah wassup
Theres only so much time left in this crazy world
Im just crumblin erb Im just crumblin erb
Niggas killing niggas they dont understand  thats the master plan 
Im just crumblin erb Im just crumblin erb
So check me out see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but shit they missed me huh
Im getting nice with them thangs because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and yes my man Im true to dat
I run my lyrics the way yall wanna hear em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks em
Nigga so ring around the roses diamonds around my neck from flexing
But Im running niggas over like a ninetyfo Lexus test it
Ten millimeters count em nigga fuck a nine
See I added a millimeter for yall niggas doing crimes
And drivebys kiss yo ass byebye sayonara suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page
Aint scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets
Like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas Im hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over


Theres only so much time left in this crazy world
