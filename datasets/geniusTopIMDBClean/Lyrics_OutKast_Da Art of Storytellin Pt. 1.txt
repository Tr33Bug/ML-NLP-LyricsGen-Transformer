Da Art of Storytellin  Pt 1  Lyrics
Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew
Lets say her name was Suzy Skrew cause she screwed a lot
Makin a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya playa
Im dickin the ho down  never said I paid her
Straight laid her slayed the bitch like Darth Vader made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada her wig was sharp and sporty  that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
Its foggy I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me seven oclock its gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though  maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall wearin a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck  I wanted to sex the ho up
She said Lets hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck
I said Cool I really wanted to cut you but thisll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too
She said she understood and everythin was kosher
I gave her a Lil Wil CD and a fuckin poster
Its like that now
Its like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Its about fo or five cats off in my Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now  Yeah 
Its like that now ts like that now
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin yawnin dancin under street lights
We chillin like a villain and a nigga feelin right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb but in spite of all the bullshit
We on our back starin at the stars above  Aww man 
Talkin bout what we gonna be when we grow up  Mm 
I said What you wanna be She said Alive
It made me think for a minute then looked in her eyes
I coulda died time went on I got grown
Rhyme got strong mind got blown
I came back home to find lil Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin her wrong  Man 
I kept on singin my song and hopin at a show
That I would one day see her standin in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm baby two months due
Sasha Thumper


Its like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Its about fo or five cats off in my Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
Its like that now its like that now
Its like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Its about fo or five cats off in my Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
Its like that now its like that now
