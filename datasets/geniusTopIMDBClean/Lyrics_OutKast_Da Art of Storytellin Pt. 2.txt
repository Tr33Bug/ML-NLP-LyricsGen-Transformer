Da Art of Storytellin  Pt 2  Lyrics
Baby did you hear that Yeah baby I heard it too
Look out the window golly the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals havent a clue as to what the fuck is going on
Im on the telephone dialing the Dungeon  Hello 
This Dre bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby grab the baby cause baby it aint much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and thats a sign
Omega nigga IFOs are landing in Decatur
Hope Im not over your head but if so you will catch on later
Played the track guess she could not take it anymo
Raping her heavenly body like a ho coochie so
From niggas constantly fucking her never loving her
Never showing appreciation busting nuts in her face when they done
Who said good folks is not supposed to die
The sky is falling nobody balling they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs but the Hornets they won
Nigga we slum kept all the guns I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew theyd try to ram me
But Im stabbing making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky east west no clouds
Him coming now fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay Yeah yeah she chillin
We should be at The Dungeon shortly aint nobody on they porch see
Approaching the final exit Im thinking I see four horsies
But I dont though nigga you wont know until its on ya
I put that on my dope boys from ATown to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know theyre smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion
Who said good folks is not supposed to die
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
Alls well nothings well
