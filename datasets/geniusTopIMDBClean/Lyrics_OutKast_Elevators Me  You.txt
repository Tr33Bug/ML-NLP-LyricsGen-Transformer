Elevators  Me  You  Lyrics
One for the money yes sir two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now every day we looked up at the ceiling  Yuh 
Watching ceiling fans go round tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot knowing that we could rock
Doing the holeinthewall clubs this shit here must stop
Like Freeze We making the crowd move but we not making no Gs and thats a nono
Check it aonetwo aone
Two dope niggas in the Cadillac they call us
Went from Players Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say Motherfuck that playin they payin we stayin layin vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
OutKast yeah them niggas they making big noise
Over a million sold to this day niggas they take it lightly
96 gon be that year that all yall playerhaters can bite me
Im out this bitch
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Back in the day when I was younger hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys bullshit
Pull shit off like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses passes getting throwed like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So so fine intertwined but we aint sipping wine
Wes just chilling Im the rabid villain and Im so high
Smoking freely me Lil B Reek Mone and Shug
And my little brother James things changed in the hood
Where I live at them rats know Momma I want to sing
But momma I want to trick  Trick  and momma Im sucking dicks now
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew we pimps like 82
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone  Yeah yeah 
Like this East Point and we gone
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from  Ayy 
Some nigga was saying something
Talking bout smoke something
Hey man you remember me from school No not really
But he kept smiling like a clown facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me What kinda car you drive
I know you paid I know yall got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that yall done made
And I replied that Id been going through the same things that he has
True Ive got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live checktocheck
If it dont move your feet then I dont eat so we like necktoneck
Yes we done come a long way like them slimass cigarettes
From Virginia this aint gon stop so we just gon continue
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
