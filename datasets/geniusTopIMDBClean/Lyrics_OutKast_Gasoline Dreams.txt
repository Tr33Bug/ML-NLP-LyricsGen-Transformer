Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Dont everybody like the taste of apple pie
Well snap for yo slice of life Im tellin ya why
I hear that Mother Nature nows on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere to go
All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga round me playing married or paying child support
I cant cope
Never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And thats that sport sport
Pray I live to see the day when Sevens happily married with kids
Woe woe
The world is moving fast and Im losing my balance
Now time to dig low low
To a place where aint nowhere to go but up you with me
Say shit sho sho
Now let me ask yall this
Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Dont everybody like the taste of apple pie
Well snap for yo slice of life Im tellin ya why
I hear that Mother Nature nows on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere to go
Its shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time
On a first offense drug bustfuck the holice
Thats if youre racist or youre crooked
Arrest me for this dope I didnt weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it
Look at me Im out of your jurisdiction now youre lookin stupid
Officer get off me sir
Dont make me call LAhell have you walking sir
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law
They think they monsters they love us reality rappin
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage we scream
Dont everybody everybody
Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Dont everybody like the taste of apple pie
Well snap for yo slice of life Im tellin ya why
I hear that Mother Nature nows on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere to go
Officer of the most high
You touch me you touch the apple of his eye
If they kick us out where will we go
Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kinfolk
Still eating pork
Abomination desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe woe to the man that strive with his maker on Judgment Day
Hiphiphooray
Mystery Babylon the great
The mother of harlots is falling prophecy must be fulfilled
The lake of fire is calling
Dont everybody like the smell of gasoline
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Dont everybody like the taste of apple pie
Well snap for yo slice of life Im tellin ya why
I hear that Mother Nature nows on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire aint got nowhere to go nowhere to go
