You got to git up git out and git something

Back up in my crib eat my shit break out quick in my slick

Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog

They laying my mama off of work General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips over to East Point still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school Id rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class Id rather be up in some ass
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rollypollies
Damn thats fucked up I shouldve listened when my mama told me
That if you play now you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
