My name is Cupid Valentino the modern day Cupid
And I just want to say one thing
Happy Valentines Day  Every day the 14th 
I dont think yall heard me
I just wanna say Happy Valentines Day  Every day the 14th 
Can yall dig that
Now when arrows dont penetrate see  Cupid grabs the pistol 
Uh yeah now now lookie here
He shoots straight for your heart now and he wont miss you
But thats alright yall wont believe in me anyway but
Ya wont believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you Easter Bunny
Theres all this talk about Santa Claus but see
Love will rule supreme
Happy Valentines Day  Every day the 14th 
You got it when Cupid knocks at your door  You cant ignore me 
Theres no need to run
So Happy Valentines Day hey  Every day the 14th 
Now I may have it all wrong see
If you know what love means well
Well somebody tell me
Cause they just dont believe in me
Ya wont believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you Easter Bunny
Theres so much fuss about Santa Claus but see
Cupid will not be defeated
Happy Valentines Day every day the 14th
Now I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now I understand cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know you tryin to protect your lil feelings
But you cant run away
Hooh
Ya wont believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey dont you supposed to be
Some kind of player or something
Bunny
Well keep on running player
Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got em tied up tight
So you gon find out tonight
Got a sweet lil darlin back in my corner
Below I know I love her but act like I dont want her
Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because shit I never tell her
Ask me how Im feeling Id holla that its irrele
I dont get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record have you ever rode a horse
Like for you to send me to Pluto I said Of course
But if you aint a sweety indeedy I wont endorse
Han Solo til Im hit by the bullet so may the force
Be with you and Ill hit you when better time permits
For now show me samples examples why youre the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that Im in
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend
