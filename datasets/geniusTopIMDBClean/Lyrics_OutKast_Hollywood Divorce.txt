Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce
And Im a star
Yea and I dont have to go to Hollywood
Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think theyre stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day wed take it back like hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
Oh but you right if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you dont even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python I meant Cobra
Im so not sober Im high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda you can call me a roller
Hold up your grills glistenin
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
Whats the real sense of it
Bling bling I know and did you know
Im the creator of the term I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long they just makin it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle but they earn
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece
Thats why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I bes the little nigga cooler than antifreeze
Defrost on your window pane  Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood its Little Wayne dont make me none
So thats why I got a prenup
I do
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce
Yeah Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is for Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I dont
If she aint got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve I dont be on no curb
She aint no junkie neither I aint no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap she aint know how to act
Now that Ive got your undivided attention Im
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon stack promise me you gon ball
Promise me youll invest three fourth of it all
For what So your kids kids kids can have some cheese
Cant get with it Get get get get get on your knees
Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Dont like what I write Shoot me a bird


Starts off 
Tenth grade the way was paved for me and Dre to create
Like Dr Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make ah a difference
Antwan Patton and Andr Benjamin
Been jammin for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
Thats quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think its dismissed
Part two the sequel all new Kast
Just aint the same gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
Theyre lame and their life is pretty plain
MMs with no nuts
Wont show up facetoface straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a casebycase basis like the judge
What about these lyin ass hoes tryin to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
Nigga please 
But even she can walk well miss her we aint gon fake it
But God dont make mistakes must be something bigger waiting
Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce Hollywood divorce
I do love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights camera action its game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife
To love her and cherish her for all your life
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair
Its been a long time we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence  is that right
But you love the Dogg gave me the spotlight
And now Im growin up showin up blowin up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me need me dress me
Now its so messy straight cut out and left me
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues rock jazz rap
Not even talkin about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood its over
But its cool
We just keep it goin and make new shit
Take our game take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb thats a cold thang
