Hootie Hoo follow the funk from the skunk
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
It goes on and on and on like that
Going out to the Jeeps and the hoes in the llac
Ah suki suki all day err day any day every damn day
I be thinking about the good ol days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss but now it be them draws Im after
Im just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to slang a fat rock but now Im serving hemp
I never even smoked a crumb of crack but yo Im dope
Mo doper than a junkie or a Pookie cause its on
So each one teach one I be claiming true
To East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL home of the pimps and the money makers
Club Nikki Magic City and them Southern playas
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah Hallelujah
One for the playas at the crib drinking drinks
And two is for the sound Hootie Hoo that I make
Hootie Hoo
Tight like hallways smoked out always  Hootie Hoo 
Yeah Hootie Hoo
Big Bois on my left Andres on my right
Tight like hallways smoked out always  Hootie Hoo 
Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport
But aint no game when they be calling your name in the court
Oh its Saturday night I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack fully packed its so tight
That its busting out the seams yes sir Im set
Oh but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp you got a light  Hootie Hoo 
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call yes we macking em all
We met em up in the mall recall Players Ball
Well its Players Ball 2 so I guess Ill call you
Later on and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek now let me see what do we got here
Draws falling down like niggas in a driveby
I got up in them hoes and I told em bye bye
About two weeks later she called me with some bullshit
Talking bout her period late guess what I did

Hootie Hoo Big Bois on my left Andres on my right
Tight like hallways smoked out always  Hootie Hoo 
Yeah Hootie Hoo
Big Bois on my left Andres on my right
Tight like hallways smoked out always  Hootie Hoo 
Well you know we getting blizzard
Cause we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope
But some of you niggas cant cope with it
So Opie hip hop to the front to the back and it dont stop
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park
So God Almighty know its Outkast for the 94 era
You heard the players call we taking it to another level
So lujah Halle let me get a swallow of that Martell
And you may go to hell
Set sail with a nigga from ATL Southwest that is
Its that Southern sess in your chest that is
One mo gain for my friend who dont take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I aint the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you
Silly of you to think that I would but I will lay you
Down like some vocals you can quote those
Head till Im dead yes its down yo throatholes
Dont get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit
But if you fall in this category then youse a bitch
