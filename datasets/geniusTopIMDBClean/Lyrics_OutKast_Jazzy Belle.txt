Yeah yeah
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian
Want a description My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there cant be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that man fuck them niggas Im going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems thinking its better for em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it had it talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy wanna pretend
Like you Ms Goody FourShoes even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chillun
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
Im willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my seorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now its real Jazzy Belle
See what if you was a playa real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life lobster steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes life as you conceived it
But your conception deception looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and its depressing
Theyre digging up in your thighs leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bailbonds
Steadily calling me Antwan cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch dont play me cause youre janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame a nigga dont even know yo name
Its a shame you cracking em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
Im leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake dont get me
See I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
Cause youll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber yeah you know what Im saying
See me and ol girl in the blackonblack Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps sticking together like grandma and grandpapa
In this dogeatdog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school now they dyking


Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds dumb
Deaf and fine they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be I know shes sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
Cause they burning anyway Big Boi use her and abuse her
