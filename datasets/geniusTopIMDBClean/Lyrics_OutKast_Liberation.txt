Theres a theres a theres a theres a fine line
Its too late to pray that Im on it yeah yeah yeah  Yo yo uhhuh 
Theres a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late but baby Im on it
Theres a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late but baby Im on it
Cant worry bout what a nigga think now see
Thats liberation and baby I want it
Cant worry bout what another nigga think
Now thats liberation and baby I want it
Lemme hear it lemme hear it lemme though lemme hear it
How many times I sit back and contemplate
Im fresh off the dank but Im tellin my story
My relationship with my folks is giveandtake
And I done took so much now give me my glory
To have a choice to be who you wants to be
Its left upa to me and my momma nem told me  Yes she did 
I say to have a choice to be who you wants to be
Its left upa to me and my momma nem told me
No no no  Ah 
Im so tired its been so long struggling hopelessly
Seven and forty days  Hey 
Oh I sacrifice every breath I breathe
To make you believe Id give my life away
Oh Lord Im so tired Im so tired  Tired 
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own  Own 
All on my own  Yeah 
We alive but we aint livin thats why Im givin until its gone
Cause I dont wanna be alone  I dont wanna be alone 
I dont wanna be alone  Yeah   No no no 
If theres anything I can say to help you find your way
Touch your soul make it whole the same for you and I
Theres not a minute that goes by that I dont believe we could fly
But I can feel it in the wind beginning or the end
But people keep your head to the sky

Folk in your face youre a superstar
Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars make a million mo
First class broad treat you like a nigga po
You wanna say Wait but youre scared to ask
As your world starts spinning and its moving fast
Tryin to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds then you go on home
I must admit they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain from the host of cocaine
From them whores from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
Theyre from the Glock rounds and lockdowns and burials
The seeds that sow get devoured by the same locusts
Cause its a hard row to ho
If your ass dont move and the rain dont fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong so some survive
So youre surprised now Im bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride fool I dont wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted without infanticide
Its like that red sprite you cant imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid twofold on technicalities
Clickin your heels scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe though
I dont think we in Kansas no mo though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldnt be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel
Runnin with they pack tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin helpin the shacklin of your brethren happening
Just by rappin
Libertad
