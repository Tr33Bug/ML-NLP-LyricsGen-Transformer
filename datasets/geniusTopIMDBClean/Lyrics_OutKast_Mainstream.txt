Water splash 
Uh yall know what it is
Uh yall know what it is
Uh yall know what it is
Revolutionary scary
Thought provoking spoken
Words of a change I dont feel but I see
Visions from me at 23
Making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Aint thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it til I get with
Adapt and overcome oh hum hum
Go get my gun load up for fun and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from MLK to Cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes now its quarter kis stacking Gs
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga selling but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing
Fatal killings and fed time to writing rhymes
It aint just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it cant happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes its just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
Thats why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
They swan diving
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin to finish their album then you find them
Lost dog paddling backstroking what done happened
Be rhyming catch of the day when the recipe calls for blackened
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and its enticing how them Joness sing
So Im gonna sing just like them to get where they at
Ill even break my by back to touch their rim if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever thats looking tasty water it down and then swallow
I hope you vomit wont call no names cause thats not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
But if you dont you never will you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing get rid of all them jokers
Face down face down face down


Think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
Thats why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
I let you stay in my crib
Now you know where I live
When you was hungry fed you a hot meal
Look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business niggas giving inches so here take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbits feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you dont mind me eating off of yours
Process smmmoking like Jerry
Meanwhile fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test the potency
Why laying here they scheme over one another mouth to feed
Deceased with a decision to make now words shake your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
I wish I never did what I did now face this bid
It was the company you kept the many places you slept
When you shouldnt have geeking like a rat jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
They got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
Thats why thats why thats why
Think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
Thats why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Everybodys a player wearing them Kangols on their head
Thinking its all about your clothes nigga its all about your self
The way you feel about your life the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family up and down like hoes give head
To dicks oh six serving them in the mix but aint no mystery
You know the history about this clique bitch
Oh what you want me to call you slut
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS Im afraid thats why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut every month thinking Ill let that fire roll
Like chimneys and smoke signals maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream home team banging them with these hits
In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish
Think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
Thats why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
Thats why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
Thats why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it aint all peaches and cream
Thats why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
