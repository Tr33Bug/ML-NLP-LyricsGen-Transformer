Mahogany Team Queens up on the rise
Be careful watch your back blackbirds dont wear disguise
How we comin comin hard camels too slow
Stick up kids do anything hustlers keep loot to show  what 
The game is hot you could never be a winner
Just begun a game so considered a beginner
Masada for real this shorty here is here to stay
Mahogany go platinum after that we just parlay
Im from the Bricks we get kicks offa loud gun shot licks
Fuck stones and sticks loudmouths get nixed
This life is plush I be the billbeboard Scarface want
Italiano Im the real McCoy nigga what
Cant be a joke Ive been through too many games
Niggas laugh but my expression wasnt hardly the same
Show me respect cause its due you keep the fear
Cause Ill get over and believe Ill come back at you

Yo now you and your nigga shit shaky
And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
Lump in your throat feel like a trachea oh dummy
The pain thats in your chest done made its way down to your tummy
You wide open you start smokin with your girl
She niggabashin sayin You dont need em in your world niggas all dogs
If niggas all dogs then what you call broads
Felines in heat meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and her done got to drankin
Oh now its really crunk cause yall silly drunk and your girl done got to thinkin
She talkin bout Girl you look so beautiful
You say thank you bein nice you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice But shes back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get
Dont let her have her way with you shes gonna have a fit
Youre the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Heres what you do  you
Grab her by her neck throw her on the wall
Say Bitch dont ever disrespect me never not at all
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause
Then black ball laws of balance at all cost

Let me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair
