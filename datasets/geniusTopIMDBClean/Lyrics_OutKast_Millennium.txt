Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now Im pacin back and forth
Inside Im melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending dont even get to say amen
I hope He understands I be on bended knees
At times I think Im crazy then I say forget it
Or maybe its the devil infiltrating and like Riddick
Bowe Ive been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty when Im through repeat the phrase
Its just a phase its gon all pass but that gets old too
Im weakenin like a deacon doing dirt
What am I sposed do
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Planets and stars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Earth Jupiter Mars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Clothes hoes cars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Its who you are 
See from bedknobs to broomsticks we lookin to start some new shit
Im writing this rhyme in faith so when you hear it hope you true it
My nigga you do it like swooshes the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your craniums with juices
See Mo goes on my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah Georgia but the SWATS is my home
Never go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito now we goes Im proud of you people
For selling your crack in sacks Im glad Im white not black
Shit on the real thats how them mighties really act
When your back was turned them slackers learned and now we fallin apart
You lookin me in my eye but you aint feelin me in your heart
Yes yes Lord give me the power we live in the final hour
These niggas they leavin me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never lets stick together and overcome
But they dont feel like marching cause they shoes is overrun
Aint that a bitch
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Planets and stars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Earth Jupiter Mars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Clothes hoes cars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Its who you are 
Planets and stars
Earth Jupiter Mars
Clothes hoes cars
Its who you are
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Planets and stars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Earth Jupiter Mars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh Clothes hoes cars 
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh  Its who you are 
Planets and stars
Earth Jupiter Mars
Clothes hoes cars
Its who you are
