Ms Jackson Lyrics
Yeah this one right here goes out
To all the babys mamas mamas
Mamas mamas baby mamas mamas
Yeah go like this
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
My babys drama mama dont like me
She be doin things like havin them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
Thats my house Ill disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school daycare shit medical billsI pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see I aint the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries cookouts for my childs birthday I aint invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you do is defend that lady when I call you yeah
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


Me and your daughter got a special thang goin on
You say its puppy love we say its fullgrown  Arroof 
Hope that we feel this feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you cant predict the weather
Ms Jackson
Ten times out of nine now if Im lyin find
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and Ill decline
King meets queen then the puppy love thing
Together dream bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree I hope we feel like this forever
Forever forever ever Forever ever
Forever never seems that long until youre grown
And notice that the daybyday ruler cant be too wrong
Ms Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me thoughts of she thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it need some knee pads
It happened for a reason one cant be mad
So know this know that everythings cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Look at the way he treats me
Shit look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosyass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl aint speakin no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what Im talkin about
Jealousy infidelity envy cheating beating
In the year 2G they be the same thing
So who you placin the blame on
You keep on singin the same song let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on you and your mama
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Im sorry Ms Jackson ooh I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
