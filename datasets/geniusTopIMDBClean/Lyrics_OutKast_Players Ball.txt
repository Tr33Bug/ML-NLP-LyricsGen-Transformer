Man let me hit that
You gon pass that
Man the scene was so thick
Lowriders 77 Sevilles El Dogs
Nothing but them Lacs
All the players all the hustlers
Im talking bout a black man heaven here nahmsayin yeah
Its beginning to look a lot like what
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
Is bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season heres my ghetto rep
I kept to say the least no no it cant cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract so shut up that nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk if it aint real aint right
Im like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth I chill with Wesson got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought Id break my neck to help yall deck the halls
Oh naw I got other means of celebrating
Im getting blizzard at HoJo I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year cant ask for nothing much more
Its OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know lets go
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangsta rides
Now Im here to tell you theres a better day
When the players ball is happening all day eryday
Hallelujah hallelujah
Yknow I do some things more different than I used to
Cause Im a player doing what the players do
The package store was closed okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous Im getting serious Im getting curious
Cause the house is smelling stank the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause Im mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses cause its in the air
I hit the parks I hit the cuts Im hitting switches
Cause Im switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
Im wide open on the freeway my pager broke my vibe
Cause a junkie is a junkie threesixtyfive
Its just another day of work to me the spirit just aint in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
Cause its like that yeah
Forever pimpin never slippin thats how it is


All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangsta rides
Now Im here to tell you theres a better day
When the players ball is happening all day eryday
Aint no chimneys in the ghetto so I wont be hanging my socks on no chimney
Im full as a tick fix me a plate I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham not
Dont need no ham hocks dont play me like Im smoking rocks
I got the munchies we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in 93 thats how we coming
So ho ho hoes check my kingass fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so um
It goes give me ten and Ill serve you then now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pittypat for no rat
Im leaning back my elbows out the window
Coke rum and indo fills my body wheres the party
We roll deep we dip to Underground see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five fo a three two here comes the one
A new year has begun PFunk spark another one
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangsta rides
Now Im here to tell you theres a better day
When the players ball is happening all day eryday
Heres a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point College Park Decatur Da Briar
You know niggas worldwide
Down for theirs
All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids kicking them gangsta rides
Now Im here to tell you theres a better day
When the players ball is happening all day eryday
All the players came from far and wide
