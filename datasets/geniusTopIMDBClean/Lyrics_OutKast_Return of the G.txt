Yeah yeah it goes like this right here
Like uh niggas always be hollering peace
You know what Im saying peace my brother
Peace this peace that you know what Im saying but
Every time I uh try to get a peace of mind
Niggas try to get a piece of mine
So I gotta grab my piece
Its the return of the gangster thanks ta
Them niggas thats on that blow that run up in your crib
Which contains your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue bout this music but
They do not want to hear it
Because theyd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta
Them niggas that think you soft and say yall be gospel rappin
But they be steady clappin when you talk about
Bitches and switches and hoes and clothes and weed
Lets talk about time travelin rhyme javelin
Somethin mind unravelin get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta
Them niggas that got them kids
That got enough to buy an ounce
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never
Seein light til they end up being like yo sorry ass
Robbin niggas in broadass daylight get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta
Them niggas who get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is Big Boi whats up with Andre
Is he in a cult Is he on drugs Is he gay
When yall gon break up When yall gon wake up
Nigga Im feelin better than ever whats wrong with you
You get down


Gangsta  its the return its the returnturnturnturn 
Ooh  Its the returnturn its the returnturn its the return return 
Gangsta  Its the returnturn its the returnturn 
Ooh  Its the return its the returnturnturn 
Man a nigga dont want no trouble
A playa just want to kick back with my gators off
And watch my lil girl blow bubbles
But still ready to rhyme standing my ground never back down
Willin to rob steal and kill any thang that threatens mine
But good luck couldnt be bought see
Many a fights had to be fought G
For a nigga to ride these Vogues
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck is gon be the first nigga we attack
Dont want that but it comes though most of the time when you dont know
Stickin together like flour and water to make that slow dough
We worked for everything we have and gon stick up for
Each other like we brothers from another mother
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers
And never the nut huggin punk motherfuckers
So quit spreading them rumors
We aint Club Nouveau
Gangsta  its the return its the returnturnturnturn 
Ooh  Its the returnturn its the returnturn its the return return 
Gangsta  Its the returnturn its the returnturn 
Ooh  Its the return its the returnturnturn
