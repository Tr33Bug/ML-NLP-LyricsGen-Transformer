Many a day has passed the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos for these playas thought we was absent
We takin another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin every city then we headed to that Bat cave

Bulldoggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you sounding silly think my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doing doughnuts round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn we the committee gon burn it down
But us gon bust you in the mouth with the chorus now say

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said Baby boy you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past your assll be a haswhat
Thats one to live by or either thats one to die to
I try to just throw it at you determine your own adventure Andr
Got to her station Heres my destination
She got off the bus the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group aint comin wit it
But Im witcha cause you probably goin through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt
Went on out and bought it cause I thought it would be jammin
But examine all the flawskywawsky awfully
Sad and its costly but thats all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shits creek Its weak is the last quote
That I wanna hear when Im goin down
When alls said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin and slowin down
All yall can say is Them niggas earned the crown but until then

Everybody move to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us
