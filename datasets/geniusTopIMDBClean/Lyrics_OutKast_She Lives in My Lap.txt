Whats wrong What are you afraid of
The Love Below
She stays alone never sheds a single tear
She stays in coolest moods clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
Ah but she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap she lives in my lap
Oh she lives in my lap  Forever my fiance 
She lives in my lap  Dont leave dont stay 
She lives in my lap  Ill get the courage one day 
Make me want you make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are then forget you
Girl remind me just who we are
Were oh so close but yet so far
Baby why are you acting like this
I dont care about any of them I care about you
Baby I love you
Youve got me open wide  I love you 
Just come inside  baby 
Its yours  its yours  Im yours  Im yours 
For sure  for sure  play baby play
She lives in my lap she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap she lives in my lap
Oh she lives in my lap  Forever my fiance 
She lives in my lap  Dont leave dont stay 
She lives in my lap  Ill get the courage one day 


I had a woman down 
On my lap at all times 
I had a woman down 
On my lap at all   The Love Below 
I had a woman down 
She lives in my lap
On my lap at all times 
Now Im realizing that I love her 
On my lap at all times 
Youve got me open wide
Oh she lives in my lap
Its yours Im yours
Play baby play
I had a woman down with me 
On my lap at all times 
Now Im realizing that I love her 
On my lap at all times 
Now Im realizing that I love her 
She lives in my lap  Dont leave dont stay 
Baby I love you
Forever my fiance
She lives in my lap
Play baby play
