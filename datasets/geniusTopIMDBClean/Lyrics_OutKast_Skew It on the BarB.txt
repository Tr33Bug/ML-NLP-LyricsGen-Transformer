Old school players to new school fools
Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
Well skew it on the barb we aint tryin to lose
Say Ill be goddamned if they done changed the rules

The common denominator the nigga numerator
Never know who the hater niggas cater to your ego
Im sorry like Atari whos the cousin to Coleco
Vision caught a RICO back on the street like Chico
DeBarge he large and got a Lac in the garage
Few parts here and there I declare hard
My Lord one at Clark one at Spelman
Both know each other and its cool you can tell when
He step off in the party women jump for joy
But all the wild niggas scheming they gon jump the boy
For spittin all that bourgeoi My watch my car
Im a star Id rather be a comet by far  Rrah rrah

Deliver this through your audio ghetto mafioso
Grow hydro then bag it up slow
Price that longevity suggest make moves slow
Take time grow eight react nine blow
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo
Fly ride though shit lookin wild dope
Then glide yo flippin the page I go
Watch fiveo jump on my meat ride slow
Watch those undercovers cop those rock those
Glock blows leave em baggy and collect spot closed
Keep a watch froze lean on the yacht wash clothes
Let the chop blow bag a half a block plot grows what

Boy I bust raps like Dboys bust gats shit
We the type of people that dont bury the axe
Or the hatchet every time we see your link we snatch it
Ridin round our hood talkin that dumb shit your cabbage
Is cracked like plumbers ass and summers grass
I been in the game for a minute seen some suckas like yall passin
Thinkin youre light skinned aight then lil boy why you frightened
The Dungeon Family gon be here nigga so keep writing
I gotta hit The Source I need my other half a mic
Because that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic right
College Park East Point and Decatur they got my back so
We gon keep on jammin and stabbin off in the track I
Think its time to bungee but buddy we will be back
And Im fin to put some Ds on the Lac know dat  Rrah
