From front to back street listen we on a mission
To get right workin street corner in the midnight
Picture the scene these fiends with five
Ten dollar dreams scheme for a sack of that believe that
Im wit whateva like Wheatstraw
Stuck servin my cocaine raw
Drop sixtytwo off the brick jump back
Twenty over now thats mo money to get
Slick we fin to lick on this corner without gettin caught
But time keep a sleepin and money gettin short
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin  fuck him 
That why he ride through the hole with the do swangin
But I make moves shake them tricks up out they shoestrings
Be more precise when we do things
Cause life is like shakin the dice but I buck back twice
Like fivedeuce fotrey okay
Im strictly stressin dirty dirty
Gon represent it to the Ttop
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin Hootie Hoo when we see cops
Im strictly stressin dirty dirty
Gon represent it to the Ttop
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin Hootie Hoo when we see cops
Shit cops and robbers niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin you aint knowin how much money you spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you cause you be buyin all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin everybody smokin em out
When you was broke though they was missin
Now you ridin bout fo deep startin to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support my fault forget to mention
You dont even have a checking account wasnt thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak N Ale Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope its payin the bills so you gon do it
But legislation got this new policy three strikes and youre ruined
Now where your crew at Yeah


Im strictly stressin dirty dirty
Gon represent it to the Ttop
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin Hootie Hoo when we see cops
Im strictly stressin dirty dirty
Gon represent it to the Ttop
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin Hootie Hoo when we see cops
Ay me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin em slabs
We better watch what we doing and look out for Joe Nab
And quit reing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangstaass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talkin cause they making some flow
But still aint did nothin that aint been done befo
You cant be trying to showcase just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
Ima take some of this money go and give some back
Cause people wont forget about the time you gave knowmsayin
And start thinkin bout a path to pave
Im strictly stressin dirty dirty
Gon represent it to the Ttop
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin Hootie Hoo when we see cops
Im strictly stressin dirty dirty
Gon represent it to the Ttop
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin Hootie Hoo when we see cops
