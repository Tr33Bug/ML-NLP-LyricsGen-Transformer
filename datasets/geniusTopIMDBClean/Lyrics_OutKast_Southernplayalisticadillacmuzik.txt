Well its the MIcrooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please aint nothing but incense in my atmosphere
Im bending corners in my Lac boi
Cause thats how we be rolling here
Deep the slang is in effect because its Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo heaters cause you sposed to cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now Im just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid cause it aint nothing to see
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No my heart dont pump no KoolAid
Jump and youll get too sprayed
Who raise yo block The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting swiftly
They aint gon get me got something fo em
The devil up in yo grill and you still dont even know em
Show em whos the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes I got soul
Thats something that you aint got
Thats why your style is rotten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell swollen got my pockets business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that its that
Its that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you dont abuse it
We gonna get cha high  Southernplayalistic 
High  Southernplayalistic 
Time to drop these bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ho and knock em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do
Is in the house like a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
Im packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue its funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true
Well okey dokey Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville can you handle that you rat
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge PUMP
You want to do a jack I heat the barrel til its empty get me
See I aint friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but dont try gaffling me
Cause sleep and youll get served with some Southern hospitality
Its that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you dont abuse it
We gonna get cha high  Southernplayalistic 
High  Southernplayalistic 
Well Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day be rolling like that today hoe
So back up off it get up on it if you want it yall
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Players Ball yup
So now I step rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac
Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue the sun is beaming its seeming
That Im glistening rather gleaming
2020 got me leaning to the side full of pride
Now aint that something
Im dipping into your hood this aint Braille but Im bumping
Thumping out the roaches Dungeon if yall missed it
Big Gipp Goodie Mob PA OutKast Southernplayalistic
Its that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you dont abuse it
We gonna get cha high  Southernplayalistic 
High  Southernplayalistic 
Its that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you dont abuse it
We gonna get cha high  Southernplayalistic 
High  Southernplayalistic 
Its that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
