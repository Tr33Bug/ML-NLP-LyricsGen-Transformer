Damn damn damn James
Damn damn damn James
Damn damn damn James
Damn damn damn James
Dickie shorts Lincolns clean
Leanin checking out the scene
Gangsta boys Biggas lit
Ridin out talkin shit
Nigga where you wanna go
You know the club dont close til four
Lets party til we cant no more
Watch out here come the folkDamn
Oh Lord
As the plot thickens it gives me the dickens reminiscent of Charles
A lil discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville USA
Via Atlanta Georgia
A lil spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me Well Ive never been there
Well perhaps once but I was so engulfed in the Ol E I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine bowlegged girl fine as all outdoors lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with Set It Off in the right
But it all blends perfectly if you let the liquor tell it
Hey heylook baby they playin our song
And the crowd goes wild as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality its only about 3 am and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance sliced up
Two niggas done started bustingWham Wham
And one nigga done took his shirt off talking bout Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court
Its just my interpretation of the situation
Damn damn damn James
Damn damn damn James
Damn damn damn James
Damn damn damn James


Yes When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on you know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappyass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes you dig
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and the next four years you and somebodys daughter raisin yall own youngn
Now thats a beautiful thang
Thats if youre on top of your game and man enough to handle reallife situations that is
Cant gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didnt call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap
Just that trapped
Gon and marinate on that for a minute
