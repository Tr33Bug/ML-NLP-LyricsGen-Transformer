Okay here we go
Yeah Im afraid like Im scared as a dog
But Ive got a new song and I want yall to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When its rainin inside and youre all alone
All alone yeah
Cause the whole world loves it when you dont get down
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when youre in the news
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
Take a little trip hater pack up your mind
Look forward not behind then youll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin cause he thought he could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her dont take no shorts I dont use abbrevi
ation I dont even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
Im a cool type of brother but yep your head Ill sever from the neck
See aint nothing changed hit the stage
Set a date sucker in battle we can engage
Ill slice you wife you marry you divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what Im forced to do
With my back against the wall crack his back yall
Naw it aint went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes you still might see a disguise
Because the wholewhole worldworld
Cause the whole world loves it when you dont get down
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when youre in the news
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 


Player I grind my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme Im slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit em polish look how they shine
Glitter glisten gloss floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
Im rollin my stones gather no moss
Mommy Im coming I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back back forth forth
Get that sailor on course course
Make that track a corpse corpse
Rap roll utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast just wont stop
Cause the whole world loves it when you dont get down
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when youre in the news
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet PeptoBismol
Need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal fresh up off the plate
Wait back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate
Debate now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo commercial break
Hate extreme prejudice lets dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin to we in this to replenish yo musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all thats pursuable
Doing Godwilling all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself Dre
Set it on the right and Ill set it on the left cause
Cause the whole world loves it when you dont get down
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when youre in the news
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da 
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
Bah bahda bah bah bahda da
