Two Dope Boyz  In a Cadillac  Lyrics
Greetings earthlings
From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South the ATLiens aint changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga thats from the ATown see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality fallacy butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for yall Im looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows bwoi
The nigga the BIG like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks cause yall niggas jokes like the Joker
Im sick of these wack ass rappers like Im tired of hoes in chokers
Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from South Coast slums
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac
This ol sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged Andr to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low I guess you wilding
I say Look boy I aint for that fuck shitso fuck this
Let me explain only child style so you dont dis
I grew up to myself not round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments
Now who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from South  Coast slums
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac
Its just two dope boys in a cadillac


It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods Coupes to De Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill
In this atmosphere this aint no practice here
We cutting the fool now
Im doing ya at the house and throwing you out because Im through now
Dont you love the way we claiming Bankhead stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb thats never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop
Yeah tight like nuts and bolts sluts and hoes they get evicted
Im dealing wit Queens in my castleaint worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like Im they way up out the projects
Cant put you on my payroll and no I aint got no Rolex
Or no diamond at the exit with a sign saying Well rap for food
My face is bawled up cause I aint in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error
Bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out cause this be a freestyle
Now who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion
This side niggas dustin that side niggas lacin
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop
Explosion
