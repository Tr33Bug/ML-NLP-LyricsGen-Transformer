Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher
Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher
Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher
Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher
Sometimes when its late at when its late at night
And you have no one to talk to
Heres what you do
You go through that raggedy cell phone bout two or three times
Tracy aint home Tina aint home
The Love Below starts talkin to ya
Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher
Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher


The circumcision has already begun
Desensitizing the very thing or thang
That brought you into this motherfucker in the first place
And when I say motherfucker I do mean motherfucker
Because Mother Earth is dying
And we continue to fuck her to death
Play with your own score sheet
Become the master of your own bation
And yes God is watching you
But no need to be embarrassed
For the future is in your hands
No the future is in your hand
Play with your own score sheet
Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher
Every boy and girl woman to man
When you feel youve done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band
Vibrate vibrate higher
