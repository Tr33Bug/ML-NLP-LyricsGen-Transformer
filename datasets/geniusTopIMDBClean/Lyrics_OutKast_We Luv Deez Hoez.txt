Just like your mama Sunday cookin turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes be dumpin that cocaine
You ready to turn your fro from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill now shes in your Coupe De Ville passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re blow me Fa So La Ti Da Ha Im tellin the truth
You suckin your tooth you treatin her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a Herringbone
From droppin her off to takin her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin the baby now she after yo ass
Yeah I told yall niggas

They aint goin do nuthin
But try to take all your motherfuckin cheese  Yeah
