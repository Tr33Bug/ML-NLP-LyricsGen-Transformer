Yeah Im back off in this bitch one more time
To drop this rhyme about where my roots at
Yeah Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah GA is in the house so check it
February 1st 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack now hes gots responsibilities
Stayed at me grannys while me mammy was at work
And she couldnt watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home down in the Westside projects
Changin over foodstamps and hittin a lick was next see
Im just a playa like that my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white tshirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin or floatin a Brougham is what Im sportin
Sade is in my tape deck Im moving in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets thats where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts lickin leaves rolling reefer papers
Im slightly slouched in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave and the hoes they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
So follow the fiends follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
Its everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go head on with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because Im true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars you shit out of luck
Because the Westside aint taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
like that now like this and it dont quit and it dont stop 
Nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
and it dont stop and it dont quit its like that and ah 
See niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years so these niggas aint gone change
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearing furry Kangols so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your moneys spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as theres that tic tic followed by that bump
Im down to stick a ho if she got a Gstring
Cause the niggas in the Point aint changed man
You might call us country but wes only Southern
And I dont give a fuck PFunk spot to spark another
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
like that now like this and it dont quit and it dont stop 
Nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
and it dont stop and it dont quit its like that and ah 
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
like that now like this and it dont quit and it dont stop 
Nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
and it dont stop and it dont quit its like that and ah 
Now now now nine in my hand ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch mmmmhmmmm
like that now like this and it dont quit and it dont stop
