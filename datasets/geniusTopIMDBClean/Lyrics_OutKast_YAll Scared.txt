Piece by piece this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys let the lies go
If you wanna be a ho go head and dont be scared
Many a bitch represents and is led
Whichever way no Im not gay
And really dont give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my Southwest GA warriors
To come in packs to feed takin what we need
To succeed you know what we gon do on this road
We gon explode now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth long as breath is in my body
I got proof Im not scared
If you scared say you scared
Whos scared
In this world Im Gipp in second the mutant
The third the Geechee how many ways can you reach me
Now most be scully went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine the season to rhyme
Been down like brown like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high while others were duds
Live high up on the hills to escape the floods
Situation they change like faces and names
Went from cool to plain from lame to flame
Man down or not man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think we aint movin out this spot
And Im out
If you scared say you scared
Yo paragraph indent I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dopehint hint
At age fifteen they start smokin Billy Clint
Now hes twentyone and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey whats the haps Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap
Baboon on your back but whats sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyones undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you cant hide it
Maybe your son tried it
Rehab too crowded
You scared she scared they scared I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it
If you scared say you scared
February 1st 1975s my birthdate
The player the BOI was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave you betta believe I tote that shank
So what yall thought bruh
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums this one feel like the beginning
The intro the Goodiewe kinfolk
Nigga its fin to jump off
But now its time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon cut off
Psych the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart dont pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone like Marilyn Manson
You cant hush me yeah
Heatll make anything move
Even Tyson can get laid down with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind dont give me mine
I go off like mines blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings and die like fuckin men
I dont care how rough you roll we cant be shut down
Aint no openin up shop we already established
You lap doggin we boss hoggin
Grown men dont beg for attention
Keep wishin high heels clickin
Paper champions leavin with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin at twelve
On the bottom bunk holla at me
Six to the left last one cant turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead devils dont have enough to purchase my essence
In da head missin ounces zip code eight miles
Suckas think I got they package
But they still eatin moomoo oinkoink
And fowlfowlfowlfowl repeats
The truth hurts but you cant be scared of it
So remember that OutKast Goodie MoB
Still standin for somethin while yall fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our powers in numbers
You can deny the lie but you cant deny the truth
You scared you scared say you scared
