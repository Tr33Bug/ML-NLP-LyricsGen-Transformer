Atomic Dog  World Tour Remix  LyricsOh yeah I just gotta get my paws on it
You know what Im saying
Do it let me see ya do it
Something in my bloodline ya know
Yeah
Yeah this is the story of famous dogs
For the dog that chases his tail will be dizzy
These are the clapping dogs rhythmic dogs
Harmonic dogs house dogs street dogs
Dogs of the world unite
Dancin dogs
Clappin dogs funky dogs
Nasty dogs
Atomic dog
Atomic dog
Life on all fours
When youre out here walkin the streets  Walkin the streets 
Make you compete  Make you compete 
Nothin but the dog in ya
Bowwowwowyippieyoyippieyeah
Bowwowyippieyoyippieyeah
Bowwowwowyippieyoyippieyeah
Bowwowyippieyoyippieyeah
Life on all fours 
Untied dog in a telematic society
When theyre out there walkin the streets 
Aint your average huckleberry hound
Make ya compete 
Nothin but the dog in ya 
Why must I feel like that
Oh why must I chase the cat
Never seen a kitty on a leash
Why it gotta be this way for me  Why 
Must be the beast
All I wanna do is run the streets  Yes 
Like my OG
Shout out SN double OP
Indeed Im a different pedigree
Got a pretty nice bite but the ruff kinda mean
Got a little bit of hindsight
Im older than you think
Living life on all fours and we runnin til we free
Peace
Life on all fours
When youre out there walkin the streets  On the streets man 
Make you compete  Yes Lord 
Nothin but the dog in ya  Must be the dog 
Ruff  Must be 
Ruff  I cant stand it
