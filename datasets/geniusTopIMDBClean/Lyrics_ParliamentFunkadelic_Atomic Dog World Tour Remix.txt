Atomic Dog (World Tour Remix) LyricsOh yeah, I just gotta get my paws on it
You know what I'm saying?
Do it, let me see ya do it
Something in my bloodline, ya know?
Yeah

Yeah, this is the story of famous dogs
For the dog that chases his tail will be dizzy
These are the clapping dogs, rhythmic dogs
Harmonic dogs, house dogs, street dogs
Dogs of the world unite
Dancin' dogs
Clappin' dogs, funky dogs
Nasty dogs
Atomic dog
Atomic dog

Life on all fours
When you're out here walkin' the streets (Walkin' the streets)
Make you compete (Make you compete)
Nothin' but the dog in ya

Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah
Bow-wow-yippie-yo-yippie-yeah

(Life on all fours)
Untied dog in a telematic society
(When they're out there walkin' the streets)
Ain't your average huckleberry hound
(Make ya compete)
(Nothin' but the dog in ya)

Why must I feel like that?
Oh. why must I chase the cat?

Never seen a kitty on a leash
Why it gotta be this way for me? (Why?)
Must be the beast
All I wanna do is run the streets (Yes)
Like my OG
Shout out S-N double O-P
Indeed, I'm a different pedigree
Got a pretty nice bite but the ruff kinda mean
Got a little bit of hindsight
I'm older than you think
Living life on all fours and we runnin' 'til we free
Peace
You might also likeLife on all fours
When you're out there walkin' the streets (On the streets, man)
Make you compete (Yes, Lord)
Nothin' but the dog in ya (Must be the dog)

Ruff (Must be)
Ruff (I can't stand it)
Ruff

Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Nothin' but the dog in me
Nothin' but the dog in me (Must be, must be, oh)
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Nothin' but the dog in me (Must be)
Nothin' but the dog in me (Must be that, ayy, come on)
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Nothin' but the dog in me
(Nothin' but the, nothin' but the dog in me, double O-G, oh, oh)
Why must I feel like that? (Come on)
Why must I chase the cat?
Nothin' but the dog in me
(I must be into the better or something, you know, I can't help it, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Do the dogcatcher, baby, do the dogcatcher (I try to fight it)
Why must I feel like that?
Why must I chase the cat?
Why must I feel like that?
Why must (Take it to the beat)
