Waitin watchin the clock
Its four oclock its got to stop
Tell him take no more she practices her speech
As he opens the door she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
She lies and says shes in love with him
Cant find a better man
She dreams in color she dreams in red
Cant find a better man
Cant find a better man
Cant find a better man
Oh
Talking to herself Theres no one else
Who needs to know she tells herself
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew him now she swears hes gone
She lies and says shes in love with him
Cant find a better man
She dreams in color she dreams in red
Cant find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him
Cant find a better man
She dreams in color she dreams in red
Cant find a better man
Cant find a better man
Cant find a better man
She loved him yeah
She dont want to leave this way
She feeds him yeah
Thats why shell be back again
Cant find a better man  Cant find a better man 
Cant find a better man  Cant find a better man 
Cant find a better man  Cant find a better man 
Cant find a better
Man
