Hey hey yeah uh
Sheets of empty canvas untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Mm and all I taught her was everything
Mm I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside Im surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter so why do I sear
Mm and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
Im spinning oh Im spinning how quick the sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see all that I am all Ill be yeah
Mm mhm oooh
I know someday youll have a beautiful life
I know youll be a star in somebody elses sky but why
Why why cant it be oh cant it be mine
Ooh ah yeah ah ooh
