And now you want me to breathe
And be so grateful
For the air that I need
Dont make me pitiful
And in the morning light
Were just the same you and me
Out on the go send officials
My propensity to breed
The higher the farther the faster you fly
You might be rich but you cant deny me
Got nothin got nothin but the will to survive
You cant control and you cant deny me
Your lies are sick theyre sick and theyre vile
You cant deny me
Try to talk down to me
My mind it aint so simple
Wheres your vocabulary
Your ignorance is sinful
You plant your lying seeds
Watch as the roots take hold
The country you are now poisoning
Condition critical
The higher the farther the faster you fly
I know its true and you cant deny me
Got nothin got nothin you got nothin to hide
Little bullshit whore and you cant deny me
The higher the farther the faster you fly
Its all so sick and you cant deny me
You cant deny me
You cant deny me
You dont defy me
You cant deny me
The higher the farther the faster you fly
You know youre sick and you cant deny me
Got nothin just nothin you got somethin to hide
We see right through you and you cant deny me

Darkness darkness darkness and light
You cant deny me
