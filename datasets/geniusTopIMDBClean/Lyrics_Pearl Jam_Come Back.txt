If I keep holdin out
Will the light shine through
Under this broken roof
Its only rain that I feel
Ive been wishing out the days
Oh oh oh come back
I have been planning out
All that Id say to you
Since you slipped away
Know that I still remain true
Ive been wishing out the days
Please say that if you hadnta gone now
I wouldnt have lost you another way
From wherever you are
Oh oh come back
And these days they linger on
And in the night I been waitin for
The real possibility that I may meet you in my dreams
I go to sleep
If I dont fall apart
Will my memories stay clear
So you had to go
And I had to remain here
But the strangest thing today
So far away and yet you feel so close
And Im not gonna question it any other way
There must be an open door for you
Oh oh oh to come back


And the days they linger on yeah
And every night what Im waitin for oh oh
Is the real possibility I may meet you in my dream
Sometimes youre there and youre talking back to me
Come the morning I could swear that youre next to me
And its okay
Its okay its okay
Ill be here come back come back
Ill be here come back come back
Ill be here come back come back
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Hoo oohoohoohooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Hoo oohoohoohooh
