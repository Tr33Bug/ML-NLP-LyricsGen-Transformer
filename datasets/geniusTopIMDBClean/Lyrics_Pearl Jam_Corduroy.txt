The waiting drove me mad
Youre finally here and Im a mess
I take your entrance back
Cant let you roam inside my head
I dont want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run but I cant walk
Guess Ill lie alone just like before
Ill take the varmints path
Oh and I must refuse your test
Apush me and I will resist
This behaviors not unique
I dont want to hear from those who know
They can buy but cant put on my clothes
I dont want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before
I dont want to be held in your debt
Ill pay it off in blood let I be wed
Im already cut up and half dead
Ill end up alone like I began
Everything has chains
Absolutely nothings changed
Take my hand not my picture
Spilled my tincture
I dont want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your breast
All the things that others want for me
Cant buy what I want because its free
Cant buy what I want because its free
Cant be what you want because I
Why aint it supposed to be just fun
Oh to live and die let it be done
I figure Ill be damned
All alone like I began
Its your move now
I thought you were a friend but I guess I
I guess I hate you
