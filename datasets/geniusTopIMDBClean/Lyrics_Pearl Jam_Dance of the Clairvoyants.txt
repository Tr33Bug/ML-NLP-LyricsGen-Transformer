Confusion is to commotion
What love is to our devotion
Imperceptibly big
Big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
And burn your assumptions
Love is friction
Ripe for comfort
Endless equations
And tugging persuasions
Doors open up
To interpretation
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the futures no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before
The looser things get
The tighter you become
The looser things get
Tighter
Not one man
Can be greater than the sum
Thats not a negative thought
Im positive positive positive
Falling down not staying down
Coulda held me up rather than tearing me down
Drown in the river
Expecting perfection leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present and the futures no more
When every tomorrow is the same as before
Numbers keep falling off the calendars floor
Were stuck in our boxes
Windows open no more
Couldnt lift up the forgetmenots
Not recalling what theyre for
Im in love with clairvoyants
Cause theyre out of this world
I know the girls wanna dance
Fall away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
I know the girls wanna dance
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow
Their dicks and fix and file things
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
I know the girls wanna dance away their circumstance 
I know the boys wanna grow their dicks and fix and file things 
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
