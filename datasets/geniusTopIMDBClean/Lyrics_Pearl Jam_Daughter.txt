You guys ready 
Alone listless
Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl violence
Center of her own attention
The mother reads aloud child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down its in her head
Painted room cant deny theres something wrong
Dont call me daughter not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Dont call me daughter not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Dont call me
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above
Oooh ooh
Dont call me daughter not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Dont call me daughter not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Dont call me daughter not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Dont call me daughter not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Dont call me
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go gogo
