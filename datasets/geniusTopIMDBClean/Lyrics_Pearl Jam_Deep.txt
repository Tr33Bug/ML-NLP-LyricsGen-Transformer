On the edge a windowsill
Ponders his maker ponders his will
To the street below he just aint nothing
But hes got a great view
And he sinks the needle deep yeah
Oh cant touch the bottom
In too deep yeah
Uhhuh cant touch the bottom
Oh on the edge of a knownothing town
Feeling quite superior the age had come
To the sky above he just aint nothing
But hes got a great view
And he sinks the burning knife deep yeah
Cant touch the bottom
In too deep yeah
Uhhuh cant touch the bottom
In too deep
Ohohoh
Ohoh
On the edge of a Christmasclean love
Young virgin down from heaven visiting hell
To the man above her she just aint nothing
And she doesnt like the view she doesnt like the view
She doesnt like the view but he sinks himself deep
Oh cant touch the bottom
In too deep yeah
Uhhuh cant touch the bottom
Cant touch the bottom deep yeah
Ohohoh the bottom  yeah 
Ohohoh hey the bottom  yeah 
Ohohoh hey the bottom  yeah 
Ohohoh hey the bottom  yeah 
Ohohoh hey the bottom  yeah 
Ohoh
