She nursed him there ooh over a night
I wasnt so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say What to say
But soon she was down soon he was low
At a quarter past a holy no
She had to turn around
When she couldnt hold oh she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh a dissidence a dissident is here
And to this day shes glided on
Always home but so far away
Like a word misplaced
Nothing said what a waste
But when she had contact with the conflict
There was meaning but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around
When she couldnt hold she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh a dissidence a dissident is here oh
Oh
Oh ohohoh 
She gave him away when she couldnt hold
No she folded a dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh a dissidence a dissident is here
Oh couldnt hold on she couldnt hold
No she folded a dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place
Oh a dissident is here
