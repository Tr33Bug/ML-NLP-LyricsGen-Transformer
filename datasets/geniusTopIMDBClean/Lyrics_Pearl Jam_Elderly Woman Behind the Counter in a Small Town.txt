I seem to recognize your face
Haunting familiar yet I cant seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place
I wish Id seen the place
But no ones ever taken me
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
I swear I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me you wouldnt recall for Im not my former
Its hard when youre stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps thats what no one wants to see
I just want to scream Hello
My god its been so long never dreamed youd return
But now here you are and here I am
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade
