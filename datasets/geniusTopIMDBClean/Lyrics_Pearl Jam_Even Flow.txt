Freezin
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh feelin
Maybe hell see a little better set of days ooh yeah
Oh hand out
Faces that he sees time again aint that familiar ooh yeah
Oh dark grin
He cant help when hes happy he looks insane hm yeah
Even flow thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh he dont know so he chases them away
Oh someday yet hell begin his life again
Life again life again
Kneelin
Looking through the paper though he doesnt know to read ooh yeah
Oh prayin
Now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh feelin
Understands the weather of the winters on its way
Oh ceilings
Few and far between all the legal halls of shame hey
Even flow thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh he dont know so he chases them away
Oh someday yet hell begin his life again
Ah whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away him away
Yeah
Woo ah yeah fuck it up
Hey man you got a dollar
Come on just some spare change man I know you got
Well God bless you man God bless you


Even flow thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh he dont know so he chases them away
Oh someday yet hell begin his life again
Oh whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away him away yeah
Woo ah yeah
