Dont even think about reachin me
I wont be home
Dont even think about stoppin by
Dont think of me at all
I did a what I had to do
If there was a reason it was you
Ah I dont even think about getting inside
Voices in my head
Ooh voices
I got scratches all over my arms
One for each day since I fell apart
I did a what I had to do
If there was a reason it was you
A Footsteps in the hall
It was you you
Oh pictures on my chest
It was you
It was you
I did a what I had to do
Oh and if a there was a reason
Oh there wasnt no reason no
And if theres something youd like to do
Oh just let me continue to blame you
A Footsteps in the hall
It was you you
Oh pictures on my chest
It was you you
