If I ever were to lose you
Id surely lose myself
Everything I have found dear
Ive not found by myself
Try and sometimes youll succeed
To make this man of me
All my stolen missing parts
Ive no need for anymore
I believe
And I believe cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
Back when I was feeling broken
I focused on a prayer
You came deep as any ocean
Did something out there hear
All the complexities and games
No one wins but somehow theyre still played
All the missing crooked hearts
They may die but in us they live on
I believe
And I believe cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
When hurricanes and cyclones raged
When winds turned dirt to dust
When floods they came or tides they raised
Ever closer became us
All the promises at sundown
Ive meant them like the rest
All the demons used to come round
Im grateful now theyve left
So persistent in my ways
Hey Angel I am here to stay
No resistance no alarms
Please this is just too good to be gone
I believe
And I believe cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
You and me
Days of you and me
