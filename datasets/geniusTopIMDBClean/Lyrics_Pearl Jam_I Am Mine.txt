The selfish theyre all standing in line
Faithin and hopin to buy themselves time
Me I figure as each breath goes by
I only own my mind
North is to south what the clock is to time
Theres east and theres west and theres everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that Ill die
The inbetween is mine
I am mine
And the feeling it gets left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
Theres no need to hide
Were safe tonight
The ocean is full cause everyones cryin
The full moon is lookin for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrows denied
I only know my mind
I am mine
And the meaning that gets left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
Theres no need to hide
Were safe tonight
Whoo
And the feelings that get left behind
All the innocents broken with lies
Significance between the lines
We may need to hide
And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Were all different behind the eyes
Theres no need to hide yeah
