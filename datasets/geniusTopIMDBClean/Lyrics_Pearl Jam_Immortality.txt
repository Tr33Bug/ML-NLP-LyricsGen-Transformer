Vacate is the word vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find the comfort in this world
Artificial tear vessel stabbed next up volunteers
Vulnerable wisdom cant adhere
A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on
But theres a trapdoor in the sun
Immortality
As privileged as a whore victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than thou  how  surrendered executed anyhow
Scrawl dissolved cigar box on the floor
A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on to
But saw the trapdoor in the sun
Immortality
Cannot stop the thought of running in the dark
Coming up a which way sign
All good truants must decide
Oh stripped and sold mom an auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink truants move on
Cannot stay long
Some die just to live
