I will light the match this morning so I wont be alone
Watch as she lies silent for soon night will be gone
Oh I will stand arms outstretched pretend Im free to roam
Oh I will make my way through one more day in hell
How much difference does it make
How much difference does it make
I will hold the candle til it burns up my arm
Oh Ill keep taking punches until their will grows tired
Oh I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Hey I wont change direction and I wont change my mind
How much difference does it make
Mmm how much difference does it make
Ill swallow poison until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out til it fills this room
How much difference
How much difference
How much difference does it make
How much difference does it make
Ooh
