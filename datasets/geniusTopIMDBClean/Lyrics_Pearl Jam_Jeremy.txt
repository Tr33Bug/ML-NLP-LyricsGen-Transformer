At home drawin pictures of mountain tops
With him on top lemon yellow sun
Arms raised in a V
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didnt give attention
Oh to the fact that mommy didnt care
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooh but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess ladys breast how could I forget
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting ooh dropped wide open
Just like the day oh like the day I heard
Daddy didnt give affection no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldnt wear
King Jeremy the wicked
Oh ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Try to forget this  Try to forget this 
Try to erase this  Try to erase this 
From the blackboard


Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in spoke in
Jeremy spoke in spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
Spoke in spoke in 
Spoke in spoke in spoke in spoke in 
Spoke in spoke in 
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh  Spoke in
