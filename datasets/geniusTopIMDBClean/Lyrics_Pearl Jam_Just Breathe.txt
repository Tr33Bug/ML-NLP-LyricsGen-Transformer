Yes I understand that every life must end uhhuh
As we sit alone I know someday we must go uhhuh
Oh Im a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one yeah others they got none uhhuh
Stay with me oh lets just breathe
Practiced all my sins never gonna let me win uhhuh
Under everything just another human being uhhuh
Yeah I dont wanna hurt theres so much in this world to make me bleed
Stay with me youre all I see
Did I say that I need you
Did I say that I want you
Oh if I didnt Im a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean
I wonder everyday as I look upon your face uhhuh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take uhhuh
Nothing you would take everything you gave
Did I say that I need you
Oh did I say that I want you
Oh if I didnt Im a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean ah
Nothing you would take everything you gave
Hold me til I die meet you on the other side
