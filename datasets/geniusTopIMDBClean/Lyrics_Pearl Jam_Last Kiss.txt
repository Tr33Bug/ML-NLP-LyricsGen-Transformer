Oh where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddys car
We hadnt driven very far
There in the road straight ahead
A car was stalled the engine was dead
I couldnt stop so I swerved to the right
Ill never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last
Oh where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
When I woke up the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head she looked at me and said
Hold me darling just a little while
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now shes gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love my life that night
Oh where oh where can my baby be
The Lord took her away from me
Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
Ooh oohooh
