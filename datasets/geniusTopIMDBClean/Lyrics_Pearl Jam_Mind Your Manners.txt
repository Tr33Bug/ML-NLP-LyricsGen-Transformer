Ive got an unfortunate feeling
I been beaten down
I feel that Im done believing
Now the truth is coming out
What theyve taken
Is more than a vow
Theyve taken your innocence
And then they throw em on a burning pile
All along theyre saying
Mind your manners
I caught myself believing
That I needed God
And if its out there somewhere
We sure could use hymn now
Try my patience
My patience tried
This worlds a long love letter
That makes me want to cry ah ah ay ay
All along theyre saying
Mind your manners
Thats all theyre saying
Selfrealized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else
And all along theyre saying
Mind your manners
Always praying
Selfrealized and metaphysically redeemed
May not live another life
May not solve all mysteries
Right around the corner
Could be bigger than ourselves
We could will it to the sky
Or we could something else
Go to Heaven thats swell
How do you like your living hell
Go to Heaven thats swell
How do you like your living hell
Go to Heaven thats swell
How do you like your living hell
Living hell
