Restless soul enjoy your youth
Like Muhammad hits the truth
Cant escape from the common rule
If you hate something dont you do it too  too 
Small my table sits just two
Got so crowded I cant make room
Oh where did they come from Stormed my room
And you dare say it belongs to you to you
This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh not for you not you
Scream my friends dont call me
Friends no they dont scream
My friends dont call my friends dont
All thats sacred comes from youth
Dedication nave and true
With no power nothing to do
I still remember why dont you dont you
This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh never was for you fuck you
This is not for you
Oh this is not for you yeah you
This is not for you
Oh not for you oh you
