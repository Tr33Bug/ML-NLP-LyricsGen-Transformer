Once divided nothing left to subtract
Some words when spoken cant be taken back
Walks on his own with thoughts he cant help thinking
Futures above but in the past hes slow and sinking
Caught a bolt of lightning
Cursed the day he let it go
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isnt it something nothingman
She once believed in every story he had to tell
One day she stiffened took the other side
Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
One just escapes ones left inside the well
And he who forgets
Will be destined to remember oh oh ohh
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isnt it something nothingman
Ooh she dont want him  she dont want him 
Oh she wont feed him after hes flown away
Oh into the sun
Ah into the sun
Burn  burn  burn burn
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isnt it something nothingman
Nothingman
Nothingman
Coulda been something nothingman
Uh uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh oh
