Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards you
Know somethings left
And were all allowed
To dream of the next
Of the next time we touch ooh
Oohooh oohooh
You dont have to stray
Though oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
I will be I will be there once more ooh
Oohooh oohooh
Oohooh oohooh
Oohooh oohooh
