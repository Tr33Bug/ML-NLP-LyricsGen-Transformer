Know a man his face seemed pulled and tense
Like hes riding on a motorbike in the strongest winds
So I approach with tact suggest that he should relax
But hes always moving much too fast
Said hell see me on the flip side of this trip hes taking for a ride
Hes been taking too much on
There he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothes
There he goes
Hes yet to come back but Ive seen his picture
It doesnt look the same up on the rack
We go way back
I wonder about his insides
Its like his thoughts are too big for his size
Hes been taken where I dont know
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
There he goes
And now I rub my eyes for he has returned
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned
For he still smiles and hes still strong
Nothings changed but the surrounding bullshit That has grown
And now hes home and were laughing like we always did
My same old same old friend
Until a quarter to ten
I saw the strain creep in
He seems distracted and I know just what is gonna happen next
Before his first step he is off again
