I admit it whats to say
Ill relive it without pain
Hm backstreet lover on the side of the road
I gotta bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes I play
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself yeah
Oh try and mimic whats insane
I am in it where do I stand
Hm Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a back street lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket so determined discreet I pray
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself yeah
You think I got my eyes closed
But Ive been looking at you the whole fucking time
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself yeah
Once upon a time I could love myself yeah
Once upon a time I could love you yeah yeah
Once Once Once Once Yeah
Once Once Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh once
