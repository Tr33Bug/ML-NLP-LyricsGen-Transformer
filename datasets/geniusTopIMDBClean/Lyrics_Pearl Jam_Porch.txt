What the fuck is this world running to
You didnt leave a message
At least I could have learned your voice one last time
Daily minefield this could be my time by you
Would you hit me Would you hit me
Oh ohoh
Oh ohoh aw
All the bills go by and initiatives are taken up
By the middle there aint gonna be any middle anymore
And the cross Im bearing home aint indicative of my place
Left the porch left the porch
Oh ohoh
Oh ohoh
Hear my name take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand walk beside me
I just need to say
Oh ohoh
Hear my name take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand lie beside me
I just need to say
I could not take oh just one day
I know when I would not ever
Touch you hold you feel you in my arms
Never again
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
