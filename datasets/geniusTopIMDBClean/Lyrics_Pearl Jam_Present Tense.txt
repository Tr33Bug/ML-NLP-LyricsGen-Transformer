Do you see the way that tree bends Does it inspire
Leaning out to catch the suns rays a lesson to be applied
Are you getting something out of this all encompassing trip
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets oh
Or you can come to terms and realize youre the only one who cant forgive yourself oh
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense
Have you ideas on how this life ends
Checked your hands and studied the lines
Have you the belief that the road ahead ascends off into the light
Seems that needlessly its getting harder
To find an approach and a way to live
Are we getting something out of this all encompassing trip
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets oh
Or you can come to terms and realize youre the only one who cannot forgive yourself oh
Oh makes much more sense to live in the present tense
