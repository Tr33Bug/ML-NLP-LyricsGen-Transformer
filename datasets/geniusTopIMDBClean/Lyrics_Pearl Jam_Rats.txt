They dont eat dont sleep
They dont feed they dont seethe
Bare their gums when they moan and squeak
Lick the dirt off a larger ones feet
They dont push dont crowd
Congregate until theyre much too loud
Fuck to procreate till they are dead
Drink the blood of their socalled best friend
They dont scurry when something bigger comes their way
Dont pack themselves together and run as one
Dont shit where theyre not supposed to
Dont take whats not theirs they dont compare
They dont scam dont fight
Dont oppress an equals given right
Starve the poor so they can be wellfed
Line their holes with the dead ones bread
They dont scurry when something bigger comes their way
Dont pack themselves together and run as one
Dont shit where theyre not supposed to
Dont take whats not theirs they dont compare
They dont scurry when something bigger comes their way
Dont pack themselves together and run as one
Dont shit where theyre not supposed to
Dont take whats not theirs
They dont compare
Rats they dont compare
Rats they dont compare
Ben the two of us need look no more
Ben the two of us need look no more
Ben the two of us need look no more oh
Ben the two of us need look no more oh oh yeah oh
Ben the two of us need look no more
Ben the two of us need look no more
