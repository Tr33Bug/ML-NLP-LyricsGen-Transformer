I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings made me wise
But Im not about to give thanks or apologize
I couldnt breathe holding me down
Hand on my face pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive
I seem to look away
The wounds in the mirror waved
It wasnt my surface
Most defiled
Head at your feet fool to your crown
Fist on my plate swallowed it down
Enmity gaged united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive yeah
Saw things saw things
Saw things saw things clearer clearer
Once you were in my rearview mirror
I gathered speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all Im far away
Hard to believe finally the shades are raised
Hey yeah
Saw things so much clearer
Once you once you  Rearview mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you once you  Rearview mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you once you  Rearview mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you  Oh yeah
