I see the world feel the chill
Which way to go windowsill
I see the words on a rocking horse of time
I see the birds in the rain
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh dear Dad can you see me now
I am myself like you somehow
Ill ride the wave where it takes me
Ill hold the pain release me
Oh oh I
Oh oh
Oh dear Dad can you see me now
I am myself like you somehow
Ill wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
Ill open up release me
Release me release me ah release me
Oh oh I
Oh whoa ah ooh ooh
