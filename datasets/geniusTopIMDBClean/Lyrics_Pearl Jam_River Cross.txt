I always thought Id cross that river
The other side distant now
As I got close it turned and widened
Horizon now fading out
Drifting off in the undertow
Cant spot a figure on dry land
And afterthoughts of safety
When in truth none to be had
None to be had
I used to tell time by my shadow
Til the thunderclouds they took the stage
These days will end as do the lights rays
Another read of the same page
Wide awake through this deepest night
Still waiting on the sun
As the hours seem to multiply
Find a star to soldier on
Living beneath a lions paw
Knowing nothing can be tamed
Can be tamed
I want this dream to last forever
A wish denied to lengthen our time
I wish this moment was never ending
Let it be a lie that all futures die
While the government thrives on discontent
And theres no such thing as clear
Proselytizing and profitizing
As our will all but disappears
Folded over forced in a choke hold
Outnumbered and held down
And all these talk of rapture
Look around at the promise now
Here and now
Here and now
Cant hold me down
Cant hold me down
Wont hold us down
Wont hold us down
Live it out
Let it out
Get it out
Shout it out
Wont hold us down
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Share the light
Wont hold us down
Hold us down
