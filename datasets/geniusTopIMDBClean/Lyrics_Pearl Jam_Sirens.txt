Hear the sirens hear the sirens
Hear the sirens hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know were safe I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear
Oh had to take your hand and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didnt care before you were here
I danced in laughter with the ever after
But all things change let this remain
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer will they come for me next time
For every choice mistake I made its not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay Ill wait Ill understand
Oh its a fragile thing this life we lead
If I think too much I can get over
Whelmed by the grace by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know that should I go
I always loved you held you high above too
I studied your face the fear goes away
Its a fragile thing this life we lead
If I think too much I can get over
Whelmed by the grace by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know that should I go
I always loved you held you high above too
I studied your face the fear goes away
The fear goes away the fear goes away
The fear goes away
