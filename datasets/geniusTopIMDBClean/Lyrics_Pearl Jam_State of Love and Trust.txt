State of love and trust as I busted down the pretext
Sin still plays and preaches but to have an empty court uh huh
And the signs are passin grip the wheel cant read it
Sacrifice receiving the smell thats on my hands hands yeah
And I listen for the voice inside my head
Nothin Ill do this one myself
Lay her down as priest does should the Lord be accountin
Will be in my honor make it pain painfully quick uh huh
Promises are whispered in the age of darkness
Want to be enlightened like I want to be told the end end yeah
And the barrel shakes aimed a directly at my head
Oh help me help me from myself
And I listen from both sides of a friend
Nothin Ill do this one myself
Myself myself
Hey na na na na hey thats something
Hey na na na na hey thats something
Hey na na na na hey thats something
Wanna back back it away yeah
And I listen yeah for the voice inside my head
Nothin Ill do this one myself
Oh ah and the barrel waits trigger shakes
Aimed right at my head wont you help me
Help me from myself
Mm state of love and trust
In a state of love and trust
In a state of love and trust
In a state of love and yeah yeah
