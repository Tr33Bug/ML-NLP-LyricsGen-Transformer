Took her away too soon
Superblood wolfmoon
Took her away too soon
I can hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once you were somewhere and now youre everywhere
Im feeling selfish and I want whats right
I ask for forgiveness I beg of myself
Feeling angry knock it off the shelf
Right now I feel a lack of innocence
Searching for reveal hypnotonic resonance
I feel not much of anything
And the cause is life or death
Throughout the hopelessness focus on your focusness
Ive been hoping that our hope dies last
I dont know anything I question everything
This life I love is going way too fast
Both my eyes are swollen my face is broken
And Im hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your
Hoping that I hurt your fist
She was a stunner and I am stunned
And the first thought and second thought was could be the one
I was a prisoner her keys and the cuffs
Yeah I was feeling fortunate to be locked up
But the world kept aspinning always felt like it was ending
And love notwithstanding we are each of us fucked
I would hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once you were somewhere and now youre everywhere
Im feeling selfish and I want whats right
I ask for forgiveness I beg of myself
Feeling angry knock it off the shelf

Superblood wolfmoon
Took her away too soon
I can hear you singing in the distance
I can see you when I close my eyes
Once you were somewhere and now youre everywhere
Im feeling selfish and I want whats right
Focus on your focusness dont allow for hopelessness
Ive been hoping that our hope dies last
I dont know anything I question everything
This life I love is going way too fast
