WMA Lyrics
He won the lottery when he was born
Took his mothers white breast to his tongue
Trained like dogs color and smell
Walks by me to get to him
Police man
Police man
All my pieces 
All my pieces 
He won the lottery by being born
Big hand slapped the white male American
Do no wrong so clean cut
Dirty his hands it comes right off
Police man
Police man
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man
Police man
Jesus greets me looks just like me
Do no wrong so clean cut
Dirty his hands it comes right off
Police man police man
Police man
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man police man
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man police man
Police man
Heyum heyum heyum
Heyum heyum heyum
Heyum heyum heyum
Heyum heyum heyum
All my pieces set me free  all my pieces set me free
All my pieces set me free  all my pieces set me free
Human devices set me free  human devices set me free
All my pieces set me free  all my pieces set me free
Human devices set me free  human devices set me free
