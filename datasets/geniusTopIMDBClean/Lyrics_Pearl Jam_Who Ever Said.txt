Drowning in their dissertations
Random speakers in my mind
Yeah they never stop their fortifications
And blocking my precious time
You used to let it go and let it float away
You dont get to speak with twice as much to say
Its all in the delivery
I said the messenger who is now dead
Was all on the periphery
I didnt see him but I heard what he said
Aw sideways talk poisoning our thoughts
Everyone walks and its no ones fault
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Home is where
The broken heart is
Home is where
Every scar is
Blinking stars beneath you roam
Room to tomb and cradle to grave
All the answers will be found
In the mistakes that we have made
Oh oh oh
One bad ear and one eye blind
It takes a village but dont take mine
Living forwards in a backwards town
I feed em drinks just to watch em drown
Swallow my pencil and bleed out my pen
Surrender the wish well be together again
And I wont give up
I wont give up
On satisfaction satisfaction
Gave up on satisfaction
Pull myself aside on a sleepless night
Sadness blurs Im in need of a light
Out of balance balance balance this time
Im feeling fading calling as Im falling out of sight
As the silence gets louder my heart gets pounding
And ventricles pumping working overtime
Our freedoms fraught with danger being circumscribed
A life cut short and circumcised
A rubble of commandments from the road step aside
A rubble of commandments in the road step aside
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Whoever said its all been said
Gave up on satisfaction
Satisfaction
