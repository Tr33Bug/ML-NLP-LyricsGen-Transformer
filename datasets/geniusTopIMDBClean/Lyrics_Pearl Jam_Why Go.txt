She scratches a letter into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday another child wont feel as alone as she does
Its been two years and counting since they put her in this place
Shes been diagnosed by some stupid fuck and mommy agrees
Why go home Why go home
Why go home
She seems to be stronger but what they want her to be is weak
She could play pretend she could join the game boy
She could be another clone
Ooh Ah Ah yeah
Why go home Why go home
Why go home Why go home
What you taught  Why go home 
Put me here  Why go home 
Dont come visit  Why go home 
Mother sing me  Why go home 
Why go home Why go home
Why go home Why go home
What you taught me  Why go home 
Put me here  Why go home 
Dont come visit  Why go home 
Mother mother yeah  Why go home 
Why go home Why go home
Why go home Why go home
Why go home Why go home
Why go home
Why
