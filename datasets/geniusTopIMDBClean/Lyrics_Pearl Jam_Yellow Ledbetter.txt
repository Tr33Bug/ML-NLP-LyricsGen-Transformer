Unsealed on a porch a letter sat
Then you said I wanna leave it again
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave it again yeah
On a weekend wanna wish it all away
And they called and I said that I want what I said
And then I call out again
And the reason oughta leave her calm I know
I said I dont know whether Im the boxer or the bag
Oh yeah can you see them
Out on the porch
Yeah but they dont wave
I see them
Round the front way yeah
And I know and I know I dont want to stay
Make me cry
I see
I dont know theres something else
I wanna drum it all away
Oh I said I dont I dont know whether Im the boxer or the bag
Oh yeah can you see them
Out on the porch
Yeah but they dont wave
I see them
Round the front way
And I know and I know I dont want to stay oh
I dont wanna stay
I dont wanna stay
I dont wanna stay oh no
Yeah


Oh
