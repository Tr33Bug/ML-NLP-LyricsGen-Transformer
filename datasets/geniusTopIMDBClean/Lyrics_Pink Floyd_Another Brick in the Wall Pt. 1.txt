TranslationsEspaolAnother Brick in the Wall Pt 1 Lyrics
Daddys flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me
Daddy whatd ya leave behind for me
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
Hey
Children playing
