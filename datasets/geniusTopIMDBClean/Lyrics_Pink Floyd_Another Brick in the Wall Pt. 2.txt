We dont need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave them kids alone
Hey Teacher Leave them kids alone
All in all its just another brick in the wall
All in all youre just another brick in the wall
We dont need no education
We dont need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey Teacher Leave us kids alone
All in all youre just another brick in the wall
All in all youre just another brick in the wall
Wrong do it again  Children playing 
Wrong do it again
If you dont eat your meat you cant have any pudding
Wrong do it again 
How can you have any pudding if you dont eat your meat
Wrong do it again 
You Yes You behind the bike sheds Stand still laddie
If you dont eat your meat you cant have any pudding
How can you have any pudding if you dont eat your meat 
You Yes You behind the bike sheds Stand still laddie 
Children playing
Phone beeping sound
