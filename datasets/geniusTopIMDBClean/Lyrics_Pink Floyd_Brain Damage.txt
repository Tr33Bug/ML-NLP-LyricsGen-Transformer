The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
Ill see you on the dark side of the moon
The lunatic is in my head  Hahahahahahaha Hehehehehehehe 
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade
You make the change
You rearrange me till Im sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
And theres someone in my head but its not me
And if the cloudbursts thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band youre in starts playing different tunes
Ill see you on the dark side of the moon
I cant think of anything to say except
Hahahahahahaha Hehehehehehehe
I think its marvellous
Hahaha
