Breathe breathe in the air
Dont be afraid to care
Leave but dont leave me
Look around and choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles youll give and tears youll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be
Run rabbit run
Dig that hole forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Dont sit down its time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave
