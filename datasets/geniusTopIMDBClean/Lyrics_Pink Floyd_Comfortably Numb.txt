Hello  Hello hello hello 
Is there anybody in there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home
Come on  Come on come on  now
I hear youre feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax  Relax relax relax 
Ill need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now Ive got that feeling once again
I cant explain you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
I have become comfortably numb
Okay  Okay okay okay 
Just a little pinprick
Therell be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up  Stand up stand up 
I do believe its working good
Thatll keep you going through the show
Come on its time to go
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb
