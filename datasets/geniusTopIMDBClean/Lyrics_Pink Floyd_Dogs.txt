You got to be crazy you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when youre on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while you can work on points for style
Like the club tie and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
Youll get the chance to put the knife in
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know its going to get harder and harder and harder
As you get older
Yeah and in the end youll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer
And when you lose control youll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And its too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone
Stone stone stone 
Got to admit that Im a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if Im just being used
Gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I dont stand my own ground how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending
That everyones expendable and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everythings done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyones a killer


Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone
