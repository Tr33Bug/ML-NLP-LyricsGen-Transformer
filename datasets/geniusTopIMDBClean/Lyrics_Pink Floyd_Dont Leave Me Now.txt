Ooh babe dont leave me now
Dont say its the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you babe
To put through the shredder in front of my friends
Oh babe dont leave me now
How could you go
When you know how I need you
Need you need you need you need you need you need you 
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
Oh babe dont leave me now
How can you treat me this way
Running away
Ooh babe why are you running away
Ooh babe
Ooh babe
Ooh babe
Ooh ooh
Argh
