Come in here dear boy have a cigar youre gonna go far
Youre gonna fly high youre never gonna die
Youre gonna make it if you try theyre gonna love you
Well Ive always had a deep respect an I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic that is really what I think
Oh by the way which ones Pink
And did we tell you the name of the game boy
We call it riding the gravy train
Were just knocked out we heard about the sellout
You gotta get an album out you owe it to the people
Were so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green have you seen the chart
Its a hell of a start it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team
And did we tell you the name of the game boy
We call it riding the gravy train
