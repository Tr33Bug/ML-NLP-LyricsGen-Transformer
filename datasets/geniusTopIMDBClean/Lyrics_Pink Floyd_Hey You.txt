Hey you out there in the cold getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me
Hey you standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me
Hey you
Dont help them to bury the light
Dont give in without a fight
Hey you out there on your own sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me
Hey you with your ear against the wall waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart Im coming home
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain
Hey you out there on the road always doing what youre told
Can you help me
Hey you out there beyond the wall breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me
Hey you dont tell me theres no hope at all
Together we stand divided we fall


We fall we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall we fall
