TranslationsNederlandsIn the Flesh  Reprise  Lyrics
Three two fire
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion that space cadet glow
Ive got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isnt well he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
Were gonna find out where you fans really stand
Are there any queers in the theater tonight
Get them up against the wall
Against the wall 
Now theres one in the spotlight he dont look right to me
Get him up against the wall
Against the 
And that one looks Jewish and that ones a coon
Who let all of this riffraff into the room
Theres one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way Id have all of them shot
