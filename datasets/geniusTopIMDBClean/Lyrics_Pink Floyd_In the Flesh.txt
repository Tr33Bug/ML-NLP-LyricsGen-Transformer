we came in
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion that space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine
Is this not what you expected to see
If you wanna find out whats behind these cold eyes
Youll just have to claw your way through this disguise
Lights
Roll the sound effects
Action
Drop it drop it on em
Drop it drop it on them
Airplane descending
Baby Crying
