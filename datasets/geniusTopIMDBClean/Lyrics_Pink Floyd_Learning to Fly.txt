TranslationsNederlands
Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp
Cant keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tonguetied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension thats learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Cant keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tonguetied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit I
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
Theres no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation a state of bliss
Cant keep my mind from the circling skies
Tonguetied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit I
