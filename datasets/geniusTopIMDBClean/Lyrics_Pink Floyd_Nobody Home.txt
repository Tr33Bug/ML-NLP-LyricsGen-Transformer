But theres somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington
Whos that
Rose Pilchitt
Rose Pilchitt Whos that
Kid screams in background
Shut up 
362436 Laughs does that answer your question
Oi Ive got a little black book with me poems in 
Whos she
She was Miss Armoured Division in 1961 
Ive got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When Im a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
Ive got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from
Ive got electric light
And Ive got second sight
Ive got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home
Ive got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
Ive got nicotine stains on my fingers
Ive got a silver spoon on a chain
Ive got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
Ive got wild staring eyes
And Ive got a strong urge to fly
But Ive got nowhere to fly to  Fly to fly to fly to 
Ooh babe when I pick up the phone
Surprise surprise surprise 
Theres still nobody home
Ive got a pair of Gohils boots
And Ive got fading roots
