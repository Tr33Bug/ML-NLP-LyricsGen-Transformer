Oh my God What a fabulous room Are all these your guitars
Im sorry sir I didnt mean to startle you 
God This place is bigger than our apartment
Let me know when youre entering a room 
Yes sir 
Um can I get a drink of water
I was wondering about 
You want some huh
Yes 
Oh wow Hey look at this tub Wanna take a bath
Ill have to find out from Mrs Bancroft what time she wants to meet us for her main 
What are you watching
If youll just let me know as soon as you can Mrs Bancroft Mrs Bancroft 
Hello
I dont understand 
Are you feeling okay
Day after day the love turns gray
Like the skin of the dying man
And night after night we pretend its all right
But I have grown older and you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum
Run to the bedroom in the suitcase on the left
Youll find my favourite axe
Dont look so frightened this is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway
Would you like something to eat Would you like to learn to fly
Would ya Would you like to see me try
Ah no
Would you like to call the cops
Do you think its time I stopped
Why are you running away
