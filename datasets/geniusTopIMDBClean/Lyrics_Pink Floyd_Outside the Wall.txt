TranslationsNederlands
All alone or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand
And when theyve given you their all
Some stagger and fall after all its not easy
Banging your heart against some mad buggers wall
Isnt this where
