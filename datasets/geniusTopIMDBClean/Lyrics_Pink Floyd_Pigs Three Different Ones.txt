Pig snorts
Big man pig man
Haha charade you are
Wooh
You wellheeled big wheel
Haha charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
Youre nearly a good laugh almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying Keep on digging
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine
Youre nearly a laugh
Youre nearly a laugh but youre really a cry
Bus stop rat bag
Haha charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Haha charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
Youre nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
Youre hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a handgun
Youre nearly a laugh
Youre nearly a laugh but youre really a cry
Hey you Whitehouse
Haha charade you are
You houseproud town mouse
Haha charade you are
Youre trying to keep our feelings off the street
Youre nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused
You
Gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside


Mary youre nearly a treat
Mary youre nearly a treat but youre really a cry
