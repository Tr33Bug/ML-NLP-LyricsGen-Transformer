TranslationsNederlands
Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
Ive looked over Jordan and I have seen
Things are not what they seem
What do you get for pretending the dangers not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No this is no bad dream
Stone stone stone 
The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leader me the silent waters by
With bright knives He released my soul
He made me to hang on hooks in high places
He converted me to lamb cutlets
For lo He hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo we shall rise up
And then well make the buggers eyes water
Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream
Have you heard the news
The dogs are dead
You better stay home
And do as youre told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old
