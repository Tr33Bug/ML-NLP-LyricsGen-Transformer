TranslationsEnglishShine On You Crazy Diamond Pts 15 Lyrics
Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now theres a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger you legend you martyr and shine
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light


Shine on  Shine on  you crazy diamond  You crazy diamond 
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver you seer of visions
Come on you painter you piper you prisoner and shine
