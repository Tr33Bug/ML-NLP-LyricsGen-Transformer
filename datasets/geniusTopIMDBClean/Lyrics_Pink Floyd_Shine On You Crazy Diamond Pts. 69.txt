Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers
And Ill be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And well bask in the shadow of yesterdays triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion and shine
