You Yes you Stand still laddie
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children in any way they could  Oof 
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kid
But in the town it was well known when they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives
