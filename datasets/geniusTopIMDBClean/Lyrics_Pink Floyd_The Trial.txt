TranslationsEnglish
Good morning Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show the prisoner
Who now stands before you
Was caught redhanded showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster
I always said hed come to no good in the end your honour
If theyd let me have my way I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied the bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder let me hammer him today
Crazy toys in the attic I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away
Crazy toys in the attic he is crazy 
You little shit youre in it now I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did but no
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately
Just five minutes Worm your honour him and me alone
Babe
Come to mother baby let me hold you in my arms
Mlud I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Whyd he ever have to leave me
Worm your honour let me take him home
Crazy over the rainbow I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
Crazy over the rainbow he is crazy 
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
Theres no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
Go on Judge shit on him 
Since my friend you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers

Tear down the wall
Tear down the wall
Tear down the wall
Tear down the wall
Tear down the wall
