Us  Us us us us us  and them  Them them them them 
And after all were only ordinary men
Me  Me me me me me  and you  You you you you you 
God only knows its not what we would choose to do
Forward he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side
Black  Black black black black  and blue  Blue blue blue blue 
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up  Up up up up up  and down  Down down down down 
And in the end its only round and round and round
Havent you heard its a battle of words
The poster bearer cried
Listen son said the man with the gun
Theres room for you inside
I mean theyre not gonna kill ya
So like if you give em a quick short sharp shock
They wont do it again
Dig it I mean he got off lightly
Cause I wouldve given him a thrashing
I only hit him once
It was only a difference of right and wrong innit
But really I mean good manners dont cost nothing do they eh
Down  Down down down down  and out  Out out out out 
It cant be helped but theres a lot of it about
With  With with with with  without
And wholl deny its what the fightings all about
Out of the way its a busy day
Ive got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died
