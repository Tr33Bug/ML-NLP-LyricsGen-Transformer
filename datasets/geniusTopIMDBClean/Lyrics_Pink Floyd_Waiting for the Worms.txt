Eins zwei drei alle
Oohooh you cannot reach me now
Oohooh no matter how you try
Goodbye cruel world its over
Walk on by
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come  Worms to come 
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
Testing One Two One Two The worms will convene at 115 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going in force
Waiting  To cut out the deadwood
Waiting  To clean up the city
Waiting  To follow the worms
Waiting  To put on a black shirt
Waiting  To weed out the weaklings
Waiting  To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
Waiting  For the final solution to strengthen the strain
Waiting  To follow the worms
Waiting  To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
Waiting  For the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews
Waiting  To follow the worms
Would you like to see Britannia rule again
Would you like to see us rule again 
My friend
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again
Would you like to send them home again 
My friend
All you need to do is follow the worms


The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station where well be moving along at about 12 oclock down Stockwell Road
At that point well be heading towards Lambeth Road where we will walk calmly with resistance leaving twelve minutes to three as we move along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge were in Westminister Borough area Its quite possible that we may encounter some Jew boys all the way from 4 5 and 6 on the way as we go
Now is the time to clean up the city for this is the beginning We need to secure our people We cant stand around and let ourselves be robbed maimed and killed
And when we make it to the Highclock Corner I want you to spread out and find them
Storm the halls and then tear the walls and the doors Break down the doors and hunt them where they are
Hammer Hammer Hammer Hammer 
Stop
