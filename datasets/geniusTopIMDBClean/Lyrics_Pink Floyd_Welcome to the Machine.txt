Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been
Its alright we know where youve been
Youve been in the pipeline filling in time
Provided with toys and Scouting for Boys
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
You didnt like school
And you know youre nobodys fool
So welcome to the machine
Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream
Its alright we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine
