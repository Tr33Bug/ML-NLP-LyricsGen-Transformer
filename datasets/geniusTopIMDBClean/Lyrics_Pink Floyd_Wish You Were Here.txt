And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um Im with you Derek this star nonsense
Yes yes now which is it
I am sure of it
So so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change Did you exchange
A walkon part in the war
For a lead role in a cage
How I wish how I wish you were here
Were just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground what have we found
The same old fears wish you were here
