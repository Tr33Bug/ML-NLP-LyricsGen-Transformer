So here we go yall
Little by little you know
We got the power
And the knowledge to move em
And still rock
A super song for the cause so
Feel the load on your brain for the episode
And we just begun its number one yall
Brother Black the B is back
So check this out
And ya dont I wont if ya still I will
Take 3 jams and hold em this what I told em
Rock the other side the sucker lied
Said he would shock but never tried and so I
Took em away I never stayed yall
I called Flavor Flav another record to get played
He made a jam to get you slammed
Back to back in the place where the suckers are basin
Whatever it takes to make it hardcore
We gonna roll it raw
Thats what you buy it for cmon
You roll in your ride the DJ decides
To play it on the radio the A side
He gives it a try but never really gives it a try
And the people request the best on the B side
Food for the brain beats for the feet
People on the dance floor never claimin a receipt
Had a good time rockin rollin on the go rhyme
The rhythm supplied by the superior B side
They had to twist and turn and shout
Turn the jam out getcha ready now cmon
The situation put you in
To where youre sweatin in
Hysterical B side cmon inside
I quest the best to give a test
And never given a rest
Your guess is good as my guess
And while Im guessin your guessin yo listen this is
A DJ to play to give a lesson
And his name is Terminator X


And the suckers on the right get cynical
Cause the records to the left and political
And you search the stores
Attack the racks with your claws
For the rebels without a pause
Cause the B side
Wins again again again
Yo Black some of you are all in
To make sure the crowd
Get loud wit it on the dance floor
Cause the B is pure sure
I never knew the crowd was this hype
But you thought we was that type
To start a riot we aint quiet
In a thunderstorm with a song
Why would we dare you to come along
Pump up the music pump the sound
Once again we gonna do it like this now
And while Im throwin youre goin
And you know its time for man on a mission
To listen cause hes in the house
Hes Terminator X
