Bass for your face London
Everybody in the house make some noise
I want everybody in the house to say Ho  Ho 
Yo Chuck kick it to em man
A ballad behind bars or you could say real rock from the rock An unusual musical happening in a most unusual place The state prison
Get in that cell nigga
I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself because they never did
I wasnt with it but just that very minute it occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweating as I dwell in my cell how long has it been
They got me sitting in the state pen
I gotta get out but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
Im not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
Word  Public enemy serving time
They drew the line yall to criticize me for some crime
Nevertheless they could not understand that Im a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength the situations unreal
I got a raw deal so Im looking for the steel
They got me rotting in the time that Im serving
Telling you what happened the same time theyre throwing
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves oh well
The same motherfucker got us living in his hell
You have to realize what is a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up  word em up on the level
The reasons are several most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto but only some I can trust yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
But I never did and plus I never been
Im on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked I never clock it yall
Cause time and time again
Time they got me serving to those to them Im not a citizen
But ever when I catch a CO
Sleeping on the job my plan is on goahead
On the strength Ima tell you the deal
I got nothing to lose
Cause Im going for the steel
Dont you know I caught a CO
Falling asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun and he did what I said so
And every mans demand got served
Along with the time they served decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warning I wanted the governor yall
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent because Im militant
Posing a threat you bet its fucking up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like Olivers neck I had to get off
My boys had the feds in check
They couldnt try nothing
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This what it takes for peace
So I just took a piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out to the ghetto no sell out
6 COs we got we ought to put their head out
But Ill give em a chance cause Im civilized
As for rest of the world they cant realize
A cell is hell Im a rebel so I rebel
Between bars got me thinking like an animal
Got a woman CO to call me a copter
She tried to get away and I popped her
Twice right Now who wanna get nice
I had 6 COs and now its 5 to go
And Im serious call me delirious
But Im still a captive I gotta wrap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand now Im looking for the fence
As I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers bruised battered and scarred but hard
Going out with a bang ready to bang out
But power from the sky from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose yes and some came close
I figure I trigger my steel I still stand and hold my post
This is what I mean an antinigga machine
If I come out alive then they wont come clean
Then I threw up my steel bullets flew up
And to my surprise the water tower blew up who shot
What who what the bazooka was who
And to my rescue it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway so I just got away
The joint broke from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher than the average bluffer
Cause the steel was black the attitude exact
Now the chase is on telling you to cmon
53 brothers on the run and we are gone
