Bring tha Noise  Remix  Lyrics
Yeah boy 
Bass how low can you go
Death row what a brother knows
Once again back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The uncannable D Public Enemy number one
FiveO said Freeze and I got numb
Cant I tell em that I really never had a gun
But its the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records they sell
Cause a brother like me said Well
Farrakhans a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you what you ought to do
Follow for now power to the people say
Make a miracle D pump the lyrical
Black is back all in were gonna win
Check it out  Yeah yall come on 
Here we go again
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact thats corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons Im saying inside
Music that the critics are all blasting me for
Theyll never care for the brothers and sisters now
Across the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate come on now
Theyre gonna have to wait til we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black but well see if they play this
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise


Get from in front of me the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm hes X I call him Norm ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what the ride the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control beat is the father of your rock n roll
Music for whatcha for whichin you call a band man
Makin a music abuse it but you cant do it ya know
You call em demos but we ride limos too
Whatcha gonna do Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono beat is for Yoko Ono
RunDMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its own feet get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B and LL as well hell
Wax is for Anthrax still it can rock bells
Ever forever universal it will sell
Time for me to exit Terminator Xit
Turn it up
Bring the noise
Turn it up
Bring the noise
From coast to coast so you stop being like a comatose
Stand my man The beats the same with a boast dose
Rock with some pizzazz it will last why you ask
Roll with the rock stars still never get accepted as
We got to plead the fifth we can investigate
Dont need to wait get the record straight
Hey posses in effect got the Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah Im telling you
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hear the drummer get wicked
Hearhearhearhear hear the hear the
Hearhearhear hear the drum hear the drum
Hear the drummer get wicked
