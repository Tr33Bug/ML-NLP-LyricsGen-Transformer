Too black too strong
Too black too strong
Yo Chuck these honey drippers are still fronting on us
Show em that we can do this cause we always knew this
Haha yeah boy
Bass How low can you go
Death row What a brother know
Once again back is the incredible rhyme animal
The uncannable D Public Enemy Number One
FiveO said Freezeand I got numb
Can I tell em that I really never had a gun
But its the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records they sell
Cause a brother like me said Well
Farrakhans a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you what you ought to do is follow for now
Power of the people say
Make a miracle D pump the lyrical
Black is back all in were gonna win
Check it out  Yeah yall come on  here we go again
Turn it up Bring the noise
Ayo Chuck theyre saying were too black man
Yo I dont understand what theyre saying
But little do they know they can get a smack for that man
Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact thats corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons Im saying inside music that the critics are all blasting me for
Theyll never care for the brothers and sisters now cause the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate come on now
Theyre gonna have to wait till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black but well see if theyll play this
Turn it up Bring the noise
Ayo Chuck they illin we chillin
Yo PE in the house top billin
Yo Chuck show em what you can do boy
Get from in front of me the crowd runs to me
My DJ is warm hes X I call him Norm ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what the ride the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control beat is the father of your rocknroll
Music for whatcha for whichin you call a band man
Making a music abuse it but you cant do it ya know
You call em demos  but we ride limos too 
Whatcha gonna do Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono  Beat is for Yoko Ono 
RunDMC first said a DJ could be a band
Stand on its own feet get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B and LL as well hell
Wax is for Anthrax still it can rock bells
Ever forever universal it will sell
Time for me to exit Terminator Xit
Turn it up Bring the noise
Yo they should know by now that they cant stop this bum rush
Word up better keep tellin me to turn it down
But yo Flavor Flav aint going out like that
Come on
Come on
Come on now
Come on
From coast to coast so you stop being like a comatose
Stand my man The beats the same with a boast toast
Rock with some pizzazz it will last Why you ask
Roll with the rock stars still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth you can investigate
Dont need to wait get the record straight
Hey posse in effect got Flavor Terminator
X to sign checks play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah Im telling you
Hey yo Griff get thirty S1W we got to handle this
We aint goin out like that
Yo man straight up on the Columbo tip
We can do this like Brutus
Cause we always knew this

Theres just one thing that puzzles me my brother
Whats wrong with all these people around here man
Is they clocking Is they rocking Is they shocking
