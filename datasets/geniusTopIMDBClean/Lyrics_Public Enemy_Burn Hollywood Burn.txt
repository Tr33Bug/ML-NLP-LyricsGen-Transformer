Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin on  first theyre guilty now theyre gone
Yeah Ill check out a movie
But itll take a Black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this TV
All this news and views are beneath me
So all I hear about is shots ringing out
About gangs putting each others head out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas lets go hang out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things Ill never forget yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over  smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn
Ice Cube is down with the PE
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big Daddy is smooth word to mother
Lets check out a flick that exploits the color
Roaming through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb getting played like a sucker
Dont fight the power gunshot the motherfucker
As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard
Thinking how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portraying the roles
Of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
Many intelligent Black men seemed
To look uncivilized when on the screen
Like I guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation what else can a nigga do
And Black women in this profession
As for playing a lawyer out of the question
For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So lets make our own movies like Spike Lee
Cause the roles being offered dont strike me
As nothing that the black man could use to earn
Burn Hollywood burn
Now were considering you for a part in our new production How do you feel about playing a controversial negro
