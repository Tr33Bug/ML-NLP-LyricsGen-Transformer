This is Sister Souljah Public Enemy Security of the First World and all allied forces are traveling west to head off a white supremacy scheming to destroy the national celebration of Martin Luther Kings birthday Public Enemy believes that the powers that be in the states of New Hampshire and Arizona have found psychological discomfort in paying tribute to a black man who tried to teach white people the meaning of civilization Good luck brothers show em what you got
Im countin down to the day deservin fittin for a king
Im waitin for the time when I can get to Arizona
Cause my money is spent for the goddamn rent
Neither party is mine not the jackass or the elephant
Twentythousand niggyniggy brothers in the corner
Of the cell block but they come from California
Population is none in the desert and sun
With a gun cracker runnin things under his thumb
Starin hard at the postcards isnt it odd and unique
Seein people smile wild in the heat
A hundredtwenty degree cause I want to be free
Whats a smilin face when the whole states racist
Why I want a holiday Damn it cause I wanna
So what if I celebrate it standin on a corner
I aint drinkin no forty thinkin time with a nine
Til we get some land call me the trigger man
Lookin for the governor huh He aint lovin ya ha
But here to trouble ya hes rubbin ya wrong
Get the point and come along he can get to the joint
I urinated on the state while I was kickin this song
Yeah he appear to be fair
The sucker over there he try to keep it yesteryear
The good ol days the same ol ways that kept us dyin
Yes  you me myself and I indeed
What he need is a nosebleed
Read between the lines and then you see the lie
Politically planned but understand thats all she wrote
When we see the real side that hide behind the vote
And they cant understand why he the man Im singin about a king
They dont like it when I decide to mic it
Wait Im waitin for the date
For the man who demands respect cause he was great cmon
Im on a one mission to get a politician to honor
Or hes a goner by the time I get to Arizona
Well I got twentyfive days to do it
If a wall in the way just watch me go through it
Cause I gotta do what I gotta do
PE number one gets the job done
When its done and over was because I drove er
Through all the static not stick but automatic
Thats the way it is he gotta get his talkin MLK
Gonna find a way
Make the state pay Im lookin for the day
Hard as it seems this aint no damn dream
Gotta know what I mean its team against team
Catch the light beam
So I pray I pray every day I do and praise Jah the maker
Lookin for culture I got but not here from Jamaica
Pushin and shakin the structure bringin down the Babylon
Hearin the sucker that make it hard for the Brown
The hard boulevard I need it now more than ever now
Whos sittin on my freedom oppressor people beater
A piece of the pick we picked a piece of land that were deserving now
Reparation a piece of the nation and damn he got the nerve
Another nigga they say and classify we want too much
My people plus the whole nine is mine dont think I even double dutch
Heres a brother my attitude is hit em hang em high
Im blowing up the nineties started tickin in eightysix
When the blind get a mind better start fearin while we sing it now
There will be the day we know whos down and who will go
Go go go
By the time I get to Arizona
By the time I get to Arizona
By the time I get to Arizona
By the time I get to Arizona
