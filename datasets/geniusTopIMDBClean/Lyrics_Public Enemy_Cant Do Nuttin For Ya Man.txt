Runnin for your life by the knife
Runnin from your wife yikes
You shouldve stuck with home
Off your mind to blow your dome
It was you that chose your doom
You built the maze you cant get through
I tried to help you all I can
Now I cant do nuttin for you man
I cant do nuttin for ya man
You got all these people on your back now
I cant do nuttin for ya man
Flavor Flav got problems of his own
I cant do nuttin for you man
Go lean on Shells Answer Man
I cant do nuttin for ya man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam
Makin love to wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night
Cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
Uzi down the bullets in the gun
Just microwave themselves a ton
Lord you tried to help them all they can
But they couldnt do nuttin for ya man
I cant do nuttin for ya man
They couldnt do nuttin for you man
Yo G listen
Flavor Flav is the sun
Public Enemy number one
Gotcha runnin from the gun  Pow 
Of a brain that weighs a ton
Cant face my facts thats on the shelf
Cause you want a handout for your wealth
Eatin welfare turkey out the can
I cant do nuttin for ya man
I cant do nuttin for ya man
You want six dollars for what
I cant do nuttin for ya man
You better man kiss my butt
I cant do nuttin for ya man
Im busy tryin to do for me
I cant do nuttin for ya man
Thats the way the ball bounces G


Bass for your face
Yo man
I cant do nuttin
Nuttin for ya
I tried to tell ya
Rock that shit homey
Yo G listen
I aint tryin to hear that
Kick that shit
You on welfare
Your mother got gold nipples
You got a rip in your couch
Wash your butt
Kick that shit
