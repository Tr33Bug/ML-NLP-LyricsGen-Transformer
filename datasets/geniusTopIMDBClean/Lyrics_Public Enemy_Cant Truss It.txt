Confusion 
Here come the drums
Alright alright yeah yeah
Alright alright
Here come the drums
Alright alright yeah yeah yeah yeah
Alright alright
Bass in your face not an eight track
Gettin it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin to the joint put the Buddha down
Goin goin deep to the roots
Aint givin it up so turn me loose
But then again I got a story thats harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust Im talkin bout the one still goin on
I know where Im from not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland the place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
And fooled the black and left us faded
King and chief probably had a big beef
Because of that now I grit my teeth
So heres a song to the strong
Bout the shake of the snake and the smile went along
With that cant truss it
You cant truss it
Let them know
You cant truss it
Yo let them know
You cant truss it
Let them know
Kickin wicked rhymes like a fortune teller
Cause the wickedness done by Jack
Where everybody at divided and sold
For liquor and the gold
Smacked in the back for the other man to mack
What
Wicked man wicked man
Get back step back kick it man
Now the story that Im kickin is gory
Little Rock where they be dockin this boat
No hope Im shackled oh plus gang tackled
By the other hand swingin the rope god damn
Wearin red white and blue Jack and his crew
The guys authorized beat down for the brown
Man to the man each one so I teach one
Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
One love who said it I know Whodini sang it
But the hater taught hate thats why we gang bang it
Beware of the hand when its comin from the left
I aint trippin just watch your step
Cant truss it


Cant truss it
Yo let them know
Cant truss it
Yo let them know
Cant truss it
Yo let them know
Cant truss it cant truss it
Cant truss it cant truss it
Cant truss it cant truss it
And Ill judge everyone one by the one
Look here comes the judge watch it here he come now
Dont sentence me judge I aint did nothin to nobody 
I can only guess whats happenin
Years ago he woulda been the ships captain
Gettin me bruised on a cruise what I got to lose
Lost all contact got me layin on my back
Ugh rollin in my own leftover
When I roll over I roll over in somebody else
90 damn days on a slave ship
Count them fallin off 1 2 3 4 hundred at a time
Blood in the wood and its mine
Im chokin on spit feelin pain
Like my brain bein chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But its hot in the day its cold in the night
But I thrive to survive I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that aint it you think I ever quit
Still I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip
3 months passed they brand a label on my ass
To signify Im owned Im on the microphone
Sayin 1555 how Im livin
We been livin here livin aint the word I been givin
Havent got classify us in the havenots
Fightin haves cause its all about money damn
When it comes to Armageddon mean Im getting mine
Here I am turn it over Sam
427 to the year do you understand
Thats why its hard for the black to love the land
Once again bass in your face not an eight track
Gettin it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin to the joint put the Buddha down
Goin goin gettin to the roots
Aint givin it up so turn me loose
But then again I got a story thats harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust Im talkin bout the one still goin on
I know where Im from not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland the place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
And fooled the black and left us faded
King and chief probably had a big beef
Because of that now I grit my teeth
So heres a song to the strong
Bout the shake of the snake and the smile went along
With that cant truss it
Cant truss it cant truss it
You cant truss it you cant truss it
You cant truss it you cant truss it
You cant truss it you cant truss it
You cant truss it you cant truss it
Watch him here he comes now
Watch him here he comes now
