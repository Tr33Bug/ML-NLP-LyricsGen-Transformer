Hell yeah
I like that for the people up top check this out
Order in the court
Yo I cant believe they got the PE in court before the judge on some nonsense
I got the S1s ready
Chuck Flav whats up
Get caught now in court cause I stole a beat
This is a sampling sport
But Im giving it a new name what you hear is mine
PE you know the time
Now what in the heaven does a jury know about
Hell if I took it but they just look at me
Like Hey Im on a mission check it out yall condition
Aint right sittin like dynamite
Goin to blow you up and it just might
Blow up the bench and
Judge the courtroom plus I gotta mention
This court is dismissed
When I grab the mic
Yo Flav
What is this
What yall think yall doin bringin us to court for this time to say were stealin beats
Yall cant copyright no beats man
Yo Chuck is their claim real
Get hyped cmon we gotta
Gather around  gotcha
Mail from the courts and jail
Claims I stole the beats that I rail
Look at how Im livin like
And theyre gonna check the mike right  Sike
Cmon cause Im livin now lower than low
What a sucker know
Found this mineral that I call a beat
Paid zero
Packed the load cause its better than gold
People dont ask the price cause it sold
They say that I sample
But they should sample this my pit bull
We aint goin for this they say that I stole this
Can I get a witness
Understand where were goin
Then listen to this plus my Roland
Comin from down from below
Rebound cmon boost up the stereo
Snakes in the morning
Wake up scared afraid of my warning
They claim that Im violent
Now I choose to be silent can I get a witness


Yo Griff
Move the S1s out on the judge and the jury
Hold them hostage
Time for Terminator X to step in and show em that hes in effect boy
Yeah ha ha
Cold Medina ha ha

Ignorance is at an alltime high
Yo Chuck I think they need to be educated
S1s take a stand
Yo Chuck stand up to em
Kick it
Cmon get wit it
Something aint right I got to admit it
Made me mad when I was on tour
That I declared war on black radio
They say that I planned this
On the radio most of you will demand this
Wont be on a playlist
Bust the way that I say this No sell out
Yeah
Hey huh yeah fellas do you we think we gonna sell out
Nah man

I know if we do we get the hell out
Uhhuh  yo Griff you and the S1s do you think we gonna sell out
No not in this damn time my brother
Uhhuh Terminator X hey do you think we gonna sell out
You singers are spineless
As you sing your senseless songs to the mindless
Your general subject love is minimal
Its sex for profit
Scream that I sample
For example Tom you ran to the federal
Court in US it dont mean you
Yeah cause they fronted on you
The posses ready Terminator X yes hes ready
The S1Ws Griff are you ready
They say that I stole this
I rebel with a raised fist can we get a witness
