I just came from the crib you know
Im on the go throw your tank into metro
Live lyrics from the bank of reality
I kick the flyest dope maneuver technicality
To a dope track you wanna hike get your backpack
Get out the wack sack
Im in my Flavmobile cold lamping
I took a G upstate cold camping
To the Poconos we call a hideaways
A pack of franks and a big bag of FritoLays
Flavor Flav on a hype tip
Im your hype drink come take a big sip
Im in position you cant play me out the pocket
Ill take the dopest beat you got and Ill rock it
Like chocolate even vanilla
Chocolate strawberry sarsaparilla
Flavors are electric tryin to get a shocker
Didnt I tell you to leave Flavor Flav alone knocker
A clock on my chest proves I dont fess
Im a clocker rocker rocking with the rest
Flav in the house by Chuck Ds side
Chuck got the Flavor Flav dont hide
PE crazy crazy PE
Making crazy Louies for the shopping spree
Youre eating dirt cause you like getting dirt from the graveyard
You put gravy on it
Then you pick your teeth with tombstone chips
Casket cover clips dead women hips you do the bump with
Bones nothing but love bones
Lifestyles of the living dead first you live then youre dead
Died trying to clock what I said
Now I got a murder rap cause I bust a cap with Flavor
Pure Flavor
We got Magnum Brown Shooshki Palooshki
Supercalafragahestikalagoothki
You could put that in your dontknowwhatyousaid book
Tooklookyukdukwuk
Innovative ill factors by the Flavor Flav
Come and ride the Flavor wave
In any year on any given day
What a brother know what do Flavor say
Why do the record play that way
Prime time merrily in the day
Right now this radio station is busy
Brain knowledgeably wizzy
Honey drippers you say you got it
You aint got no flavor and I can prove it
Flavor Flav the flav all of flavors
Onion and garlic Frenchfried potatoes
Make your breath stink breathe fire
Make any onion the best crier
I know it sounds crazy but it fits perfect
Peter perfect picked a perfect Peter
Honey dripper sucker sipper big dipper sucker dripper
Dripping suckers till its going out of style
Creating suckers for the Flavor Flav pile
Flavor Flav the flavor of the pile
Lamping boy Medina style
Kicking the flavor getting busy
Youre going out I think youre dizzy
I think youre hungry cause youre starving for Flavor
Flavor most put it on your toast
Eat it and taste it and swallow it down
Imperial Flavor gives you the crown
Of the king called Flavor the king of all flavors
Rolls and rolls and rolls of life savers
Flavor Flav is in everything you eat
Cause everything you eat got flavor
Flavor Flav is the first taste you get in the morning
Your breakfast is the flavor
In between that your lunch in between that your dinner
In between that your midnight flavor
Thats right boy
