Hammersmith Odeon are you ready for the Def Jam Tour
Let me hear you make some noise
In concert for BBC Television tonight and a fresh start to the week
Let me hear you make some noise for Public Enemy
Peace Armageddon it been in effect go get a late pass Step
This time around the revolution will not be televised Step
London England consider yourselves warned
Alright lets make some fuckin noise
Cmon lets crank this shit up and get busy
