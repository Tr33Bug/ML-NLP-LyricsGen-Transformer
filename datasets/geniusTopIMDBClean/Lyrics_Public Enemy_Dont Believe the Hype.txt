Now heres what I want yall to do for me 
Back caught you lookin for the same thing
Its a new thing check out this I bring
Uh oh the roll below the level cause Im livin low
Next to the bass  Cmon  turn up the radio
They claiming Im a criminal
But now I wonder how some people never know
The enemy could be their friend guardian
Im not a hooligan I rock the party and
Clear all the madness Im not a racist
Preach to teach to all  Cause some they never had this 
Number one not born to run about the gun
I wasnt licensed to have one
The minute they see me fear me
Im the epitome of public enemy
Used abused without clues
I refuse to blow a fuse
They even had it on the news
Dont believe the hype
Dont
Dont
Dont
Dont believe the hype

Dont believe the hype
Yes was the start of my last jam
So here it is again another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics you can hang em Ill hold the rope
But they hope to the Pope and pray it aint dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Dont tell me that you understand until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane insane
Yes to them but to me Im a different kind
Were brothers of the same mind unblind
Caught in the middle and not surrendering
I dont rhyme for the sake of riddling
Some claim that Im a smuggler
Some say I never heard of ya a rap burglar
False media we dont need it do we
Its fake thats what it be to ya dig me
Yo Terminator X step up on the stand
And show these people what time it is boy

Dont believe the hype its a sequel
As an equal can I get this through to you
My 98 booming with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks cant stop the dunk
Coming from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate they drink Clorox
Attack the Black because I know they lack exact
The cold facts and still they try to Xerox
The leader of the new school uncool
Never played the fool just made the rules
Remember theres a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a time bomb
In the daytime radios scared of me
Cause Im mad plus Im the enemy
They cant come on and play me in prime time
Cause I know the time cause Im getting mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know Im living right so here go the micsike
Before I let it go dont rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to Herb yo if you cant swing this
Learn the words you might sing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it defy it I swing Bolos
And then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that some media is the wack
As you believe its true
It blows me through the roof
Suckers liars get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
From them I say dont believe the hype
Yo Chuck they must be on the pipe right 
Their pens and pads Ill snatch cause Ive had it
Im not a addict fiending for static
Ill see their tape recorder and I grab it
No you cant have it back silly rabbit 
Im going to my media assassin
Harry AllenI gotta ask him
Yo Harry youre a writerare we that type 
Dont believe the hype 
Now heres what I want yall to do for me 
Dont believe

I got Flavor and all those things you know
Yeah boy part two bum rush the show 
Yo Griff get the green black and red and
Gold down countdown to Armageddon
88 you wait the S1s will
Put the left in effect and I still will
Rock the hard jams treat it like a seminar
Reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard
Some say Im negative but theyre not positive
But what I got to give  The media says this 
Red black and green you know what I mean
Yo dont believe that hype
They got to be beaming that pipe you know what Im saying
Yo them Megas got em going up to see Captain Kirk
Like a jerk and they outta work
Let me tell you a little something man
A lot of people on daytime radio scared of us
Because they too ignorant to understand the lyrics of the
Truth that we pumping into them cloggedup brain cells
That just spun their little wooden skulls they call caps
You know what Im saying
But the S1sll straighten it out quickfast in a hurry
Dont worry Flavor vision aint blurry you know what Im saying
Yo Terminator X
