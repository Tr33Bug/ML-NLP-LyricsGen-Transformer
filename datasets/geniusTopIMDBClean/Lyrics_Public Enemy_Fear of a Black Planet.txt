Where is Public Enemy Whats the big deal
Whats your latest hit brother
Fear of a Black Planet 
Man dont you worry bout a thing
Bout your daughter nope shes not my type
But suppose she said she loved me 
Are you afraid of the mix of Black and White
Livin in a land where the law say
Mixing of race makes the blood impure
Shes a woman Im a man
Look at your face I see ya cant stand it
Man you need to calm down dont get mad
I dont need your sista
But suppose she said she loved me
Would you still love her or would you dismiss her
What is pure Who is pure
Is it European I aint sure
If the whole world was to come through peace and love
Then what would we be made of
Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know White comes from Black
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose
Man I dont want your wife
Stop screamin its not the end of your life
But suppose she said she loved me 
Whats wrong with some color in your family tree
I dont know hey Im just a rhyme sayer
Skins protected gainst the ozone layers
Breakdown 2001
Might be best to be Black or just Brown countdown
Ive been wonderin why people livin in fear of my shade
Or my hightop fade 
Im not the one thats runnin but they got me on the run
Treat me like I had a gun
All I got is genes and chromosomes
Consider me Black to the bone
All I want is peace and love on this planet
Aint how that God planned it
Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know White comes from Black
No need to be confused
Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose
