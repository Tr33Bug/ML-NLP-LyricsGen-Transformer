This is revolution shit
Uh yeah cmon and get down
Uh yeah cmon and get down
Uh yeah hey
The year is 2020 the number
Another summer get down
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hitting the heart cause I know you got soul
Brothers and sisters
The Information Age
Got em seein whats really wrong with these racist days
I honor the strong and pity the weak
Your thoughts run your life be careful what you think
Haiti beat France a century seventeen
Salute Toussaint and Dessalines
And I do love France know what I mean
Its the system Im talkin nobodys agreein
They say Suicide when dead bodies are swingin
Cowards are huntin black men thats what Im seein
How many Tulsas have been burnt down
And once Central Park was a thrivin black town
Yo Chuck Im fightin the power right now
Thanks to you Flav and PE puttin it down
Puttin your life on the line so I could rap now
The next generation still singin Fight the Power
Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power we got to fight the powers that be
Police think they reign 6ix9ine over the law  Yeah 
When they give us short sticks but we really need a long
To the boys in the hood duckin bullets and batons
From boys in the hood triple Ks on they arm
Four fingers on my palm screamin Fight
Change the policy before I buy back our property
You love Black Panther but not Fred Hampton
Word to the Howards and the Aggies and the Hamptons
They book us wont book us Im Booker
T Washington George killed for twenty
Think about it  Think  thats two thousand pennies
The value of black life the cost of goin to Wendys
For a fourquarter burger ended in murder
Fight for Breonna and the pain of her mother gotta


Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power we got to fight the powers that be
Yeah generations just how long we been at war
The revolution on all platforms
You break a mans mind in his back
Yo solidarity is what Im wearin all black for
For comrades who done fought without me
Its not to try and change yall thoughts about me
Or to redirect your reports about me
Dear white people you should take a course about me
Cause is it the long dingaling Fourfinger ring
The sciences and the arts the songs we can sing
I really wanna know why yall so scared
Prolly cause the promised land we almost there
But look I think of images that fuel my youth
Been influenced by Craig Hodges and AbdulRauf
Examples like Olympic Black Power salutes
To Panther troops I saw as I pursued my truth
If racism is the cancer Black Thoughts the answer
Gotta get up off the back porch emancipate your minds
Get your bodies back from ransom  Cmon 
And all black hands up for the anthem
Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power we got to fight the powers that be
Yo yo check this out man
Bring that beat back man  Bring that beat back 
In two three four hit it
People people stronger than this evil
Smashin your power structure melanin royal regal
System designed to kill and unprotect
Worldwide hit the streets just to get some respect
Our fight and our rights for freedom will never waver
But justice Breonna Taylor salute Chuck and Flava
Feel the same anger since Radio Raheem died
Black power to the people push forward pride
Fight power like its the opp though
Born to fight I made it off the block though
Thought he had a gun and he was black thats the combo
The police killed George havin a convo  George 
They killed Malcolm X they killed Doctor King  Doctor King 
They gave us guns and dope they wanna stop our kings
They tryna erase our history stop and think
History class aint tell us bout Juneteeth
Cops dont give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a negro hes a hero
Fuck livin life on welfare
The last one who cared was Obamacare
Round twelve nose kinda bloody gotta keep fightin
Trump flew to North Korea they respect violence
If you aint tryna have your city on fire
Put some respect on our name we come from gold and diamonds
Fight the power  Fight the power 
Fight the power we got to fight the powers that be
Yo yo
Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight up racist that sucker was simple and plain
Motherfuck him and John Wayne
Cause Im Black and Im proud
Im ready Im hyped plus Im amped
Most of my heroes dont appear on no stamps
Sample a look back you look and find
Nothing but rednecks for four hundred years if you check
Dont Worry Be Happy was a number one jam
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here
Get it  Lets get this party started right
Right on cmon
What we got to say
Power to the people no delay
Make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be
