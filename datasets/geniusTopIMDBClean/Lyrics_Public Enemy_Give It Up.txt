Aight  Aight  aight  Aight 
Aight  Aight  aight  Aight 
Im aight if you aight  Im aight 
I be better  get some of that bass
Word give it up aight 
You know what Im sayin Yeah
Booty quaking body shaking
Nough attacking brains aracking
Clock tocking Chuck rocking
Flavor Flav aint never shaving
One two three four hit it 
Its another record check it mad method
To put my brothers and sisters on a deathbed
You know he cheated took what he wanted but now you blunted
Suckin up to the devil steppin down a level
Its who they fear is you
Who protects us from us and you from you
Yes and it counts fuck the forty ounce
I sued them bastards yeah they got bounced
I did em like a demo  Threw em out the window 
I took a 98 cause I never liked a limo
But pump pump pump pupump pump it up
A mad rhyme for mad times thats whats up
Some aint gonna change I got em in a range
I gotta rearrange so Im buildin back ya brain
Wreckin records with funky stuff
Am I loud enough  Yeah  You got to give it up
Give it up give it up give it up yo
Give it up give it up gotta give it up
Give it up give it up give it up now  Yeah 
Give it up give it up gotta give it up  Youve gots to give it up now 
Give it up give it up give it up yo
Give it up give it up gotta give it up
Give it up give it up give it up now
Give it up give it up gotta give it up


Come again with the same old bounce
Im callin a foul and once again it counts
Mad tense mad tense brothers know
The blunts in the back got the black behind and thats whack
And once again its on
Hey Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin I dont care its on
Im comin with a rhyme  What  Im lettin go a rhyme  Yeah 
I gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times
Call me a Hannibal lecture yes I checked her
They dont hear me though so here I go
Im sick and tired so Slyll take ya higher
While Im taking his sound to bring you down
Rappers rippin a lyrical kickin fingerlickin
But to the rhythm Im givin but never cotton pickin
Like James Brown Im sayin it loud
Am I loud enough Huh you got to give it up
Some aint gonna change some aint gonna change
Some aint gonna never ever change  Louder 
Some aint gonna change some aint gonna change
Some aint gonna never ever change
Give it up give it up give it up yo
Give it up give it up gotta give it up
Give it up give it up give it up now
Give it up give it up gotta give it up
And when Im comin some numb dumb and fulla cum
Some second guessing my lessons about saving young
Some dont know like Run said so here we go  Yeah 
Where it is inside whoop there it is there it is
There it is damn right
My man X is a bad mother  Shut your mouth 
Im talking about Terminator hes the man
There it is can you hit me off with another one
Give it up give it up give it up yo  Yeah 
Give it up give it up gotta give it up  Hey

Give it up give it up gotta give it up  Cmon 
Give it up give it up give it up now
Give it up give it up gotta give it up
I never did represent doing dumb shit
No gangsta lyin Id rather diss Presidents
Dead or alive bring em and Ill swing em
I vocalize I just rap I dont sing em
Flick em and I fling em you can go with em
Hall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing em
Go Grandmama close but no cigar
I got mine for Im using my rhyme
The flow go wherever I want and thats clever
Give a piece of my time to prevent some crime
And whos behind putting the guns to the young ones
The ones that make em is the ones that take em
Rugged for no reason down in duck season
I dont want my mama on the street wearing armor
So check yourself before ya wreck yourself
Respect yourself ha you gotta give it up
Give it up give it up give it up yo  Yeah 
Give it up give it up gotta give it up
Give it up give it up give it up now
Give it up give it up gotta give it up
