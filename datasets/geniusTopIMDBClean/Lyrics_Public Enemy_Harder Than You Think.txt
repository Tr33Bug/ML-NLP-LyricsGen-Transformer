Yo Chuck bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio
Ya know what Im sayin
And this brother stopped me and asked me Yo wassup with that brother Chuckie D He swear he nice
I said Yo the brother dont swear hes nice he knows hes nice
Ya know what Im sayin
So Chuck I got a feelin you turning him into a Public Enemy man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me
On the way out to LA Laurelton Queens
While we was in the car on our way to the Shop
Well yo right now kick the bass for them brothers
And let em know
What goes on
Rolling Stones of the rap game not bragging
Lips bigger than Jagger not saggin
Spell it backwards Ima leave it at that
That aint got nothing to do with rap
Check the facts expose those cats
Who pose as heroes and take advantage of blacks
Your governments gangster so cut the crap
A war going on so where yall at
Fight the Power comes great responsibility
F the Police but whos stopping you from killing me
Disaster fiascos over a loop by PE
If its an I instead of we believing TV
Spitting riches bitches and this new thing about snitches
Watch them asses move as the masses switches
System dissed them but barely missed her
My sole intention to save my brothers and sisters

Screamin gangsta twenty years later
Of course endorsed while consciousness faded
New generation believin them fables
Gangster Boogie on two turntables
Show no love so its easy to hate it
Desecrated while the coroner waited
Any given Sunday so where yall rate it
Wit slavery lynchin and them drugs infiltrated
Im like that doll Chucky baby
Keep comin back to live love life like Im crazy
Keep it movin Rising to the Top
Doug Fresh clean livin you dont stop
Revolution means change dont look at me strange
So I cant repeat what other rappers be sayin
You dont stand for something you fall for anything

Thank you for lettin us be ourselves
