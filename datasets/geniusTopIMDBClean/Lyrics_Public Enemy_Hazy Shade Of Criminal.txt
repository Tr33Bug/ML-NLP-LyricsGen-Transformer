But he like so many other White leaders appears to have missed the point
Once the riot started it went like a forest fire It started in a lot of different places at pretty much the same time
Five hundred FBI agents comin after us with a license to kill
Thirty mil claimin its just a drug bust
They thinkin they making a fly switch
Replace the devil for a witch dirty 
Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people and the beats
Oh yes 
Some people accuse some people of crimes
Some people get away with losin my rhyme  Uh 
They dont like where Im comin from so they play dumb
Dumbdiggetydumbdiggetydumb
But Im tellin you what they do  everybody plays a fool
While the real thief cools in a pool  Yeah 
He who got the finger on the war button
Talkin loud and sayin nothin
TV got em bigger than life
Oh yes  All he needs is a knife
Who the criminal
Blind deaf and dumb hard to see em comin but they come here they come
Dont be dumbdiggetydumb
Politickin write bad checks still they gettin wrecked
Going for a  neck  Uh 
Rolling in a blue and white gang
Ready to bangbiggetybang
Hanging round the hangin rope
Nope nope nope  NOPE
I aint bendin for the soap  Yeah 
Never understood why the hood half a whos in the joint
Now they got me losin my point
Gotta have it goin on
Born criminal born
Take a piece of America back but who had it first
Hear the Indian curse  Uh 
Robbed and stole so many so much it aint funny
Now who got em face on money
Politician passin a bill paid in full
Cnote rockin in a pocket how they livin
Making sure they lockin us up I got a feelin Im  In a minute 
When it come to somethin we say
What they dont like is a brother like me on the mic in fact
To the gritty aint none of us wack
Noriega had back  Yeah 
Jeffrey Dahmer enters the room without cuffs
How the hell do we set stuffed
In the back of a cell on a isle aint it wild
Whats criminal
Power to the people and the beats
Only if I had one more
Time to kick the rhythm that keep rippin down the door
So the real criminals get exposed behind the clothes
Doors and the suits that make and break the law
Lookin for my own cause I had enough bull
I cant understand it must been the crooked way they planned it
Police posed to keep the peace
But I cant trust em so I keep my piece
Loaded and cocked cause I dont miss the block
Talk about the ones who dont get chained to the rock
Those who got away with the dirt and the grime
While we go away for the neighborhood crime
Never liked what I saw in the law
Indiana trees hanging us instead of leaves  Yeah 
We hanging from the roof  Yeah 
By real criminals
They thinkin they making a fly switch
Replace the devil for a witch dirty 
Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people and the beats
Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people and the beats
Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people and the beats
Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people and the beats
Power to the people and the beats
Power to the people and the beats
