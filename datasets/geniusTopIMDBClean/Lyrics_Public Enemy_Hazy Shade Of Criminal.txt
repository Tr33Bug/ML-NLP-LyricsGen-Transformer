But he like so many other White leaders appears to have missed the point
Once the riot started it went like a forest fire It started in a lot of different places at pretty much the same time
Five hundred FBI agents comin after us with a license to kill
Thirty mil claimin its just a drug bust
They thinkin they making a fly switch
Replace the devil for a witch dirty 
Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people and the beats

Take a piece of America back but who had it first

How the hell do we set stuffed
In the back of a cell on a isle aint it wild
Whats criminal
Power to the people and the beats
Only if I had one more
Time to kick the rhythm that keep rippin down the door
So the real criminals get exposed behind the clothes
Doors and the suits that make and break the law
Lookin for my own cause I had enough bull
I cant understand it must been the crooked way they planned it
Police posed to keep the peace
But I cant trust em so I keep my piece
Loaded and cocked cause I dont miss the block
Talk about the ones who dont get chained to the rock
Those who got away with the dirt and the grime
While we go away for the neighborhood crime
Never liked what I saw in the law
Indiana trees hanging us instead of leaves  Yeah 
We hanging from the roof  Yeah 
By real criminals
They thinkin they making a fly switch
Replace the devil for a witch dirty
