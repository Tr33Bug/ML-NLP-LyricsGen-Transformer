He Got Game  Album Version  Lyrics
Yeah thats right this cut goes out to all yall thats been missin us for mad years
One love yall
Yeah thats right He Got Game
PE 1998
If man is the father the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe then why
Is this verse comin six times rehearsed
Dont freestyle much but I write em like such  Word 
Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens
What does it all mean all this shit Im seein
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Signs of a local nigga unravelling  uh huh 
My wanderin got my ass wondering
Where Christ is in all this crisis
Hatin Satan never knew what nice is
Check the papers while I bet on ices
More than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres prayers laced with fear
Beware two triple O is near
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin
But damn the game if it dont mean nothin
What is game Who got game
Wheres the game in life behind the game behind the game
I got game shes got game
We got game they got game he got game
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin
But fuck the game if it aint sayin nothin
Damn was it something I said
Pretend you dont see so you turn your head
Ray scared of his shadow does it matter
Thought of reparations got em playin with the population
Nothin to lose everythings approved
People used even murders excused  You preach to em yo 
White men in suits dont have to jump
Still a thousand and one ways to lose with his shoes
God takes care of old folks and fools
While the devil takes care of makin all the rules
Folks dont even own themselves
Payin mental rent to corporate presidents  My man my man 
Ugh one outta million residents
Bein dissident who aint kissin it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sick missin chips and all the championships
Whats Love Got To Do with what you got
Dont let a win get to your head or a loss to your heart  Word 
Nonsense perseveres prayers laced with fear
Beware two triple O is near
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin
But damn the game if it dont mean nothin
What is game Who got game
Wheres the game in life behind the game behind the game
I got game shes got game
We got game they got game he got game
It might feel good it might sound a little somethin
But fuck the game if it aint sayin nothin
Yeah thats right eerybody got game
But we just here to let yall know
That PE is in full effect from right now till the year 2000
Aiyo my man sing it
Theres something happening here  Yeah yeah 
What it is aint exactly clear
Theres a man with a gun over there  Yeah thats right hah haha 
Tellin me I got to beware
Its time we stop children whats that sound
Everybody look whats goin down
Aiyo I dont think they heard you Stevie
Kick it to em again one more time 
Its time we stop children whats that sound
Everybody look whats goin down

Stop look whats that sound
Everybody knows whats goin down
Stop look whats that sound
Everybody knows whats goin down
Come on sing it
Sing it again yall come on
Hey
Hehey
Aiyo these are some serious times that were livin in G
And a new world order is about to begin yknowhutImsayin
Now the question is  are you ready for the real revolution
Which is the evolution of the mind
If you seek then you shall find that we all come from the divine
You dig what Im sayin
Now if you take heed to the words of wisdom
That are written on the walls of life
Then universally we will stand and divided we will fall
Because love conquers all you understand what Im sayin
This is a call to all you sleepin souls
Wake up and take control of your own cipher
And be on the lookout for the spirit snipers
Tryin to steal your light yknowhutImsayin
Look withinside yourself for peace
Give thanks live life and release
You dig me You got me
