Yeah
One minute worth of shit
Yo this is it
I wanna talk about us and us
Disgusted at the Uncle Toms
Droppin bombs in the hood
Sellout niggas selling drugs
And how could you love living in the projects
Getting checks and giving it back to the government
Bust yo ass to pay the rent
And lets look at that word project
Another word for experiment
One side of the streets is a church
Across the road is a liquor store
Both of them keeping us poor
Keeping us down my hood aint considered a town
And the joint
Packed back to back with black
Full of brothers doing a bid
Who did something but did not think
And a college of forward black thinkers
Who aint doin a damn thing collectively
And the negro where the fuck does he go
Cause right here is apartheid he can run but he cant hide
