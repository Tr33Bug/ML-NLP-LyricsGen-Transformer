On time get it down to pump the Hard Rhymer
Once again back is the incredible 
On time get it down to pump the Hard Rhymer
Once again back is the incredible 
On time get it down to pump the Hard Rhymer
Rhyme animal the uncannable D Public Enemy Number One 
On time get it down to pump the Hard Rhymer
Black is back black is back 
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Engaging on the stage on a track t ell Jack stay in the back
I was born
Every level Im on youre warned
Just in case you forgot I pump in kilowatts
To let em know which direction
To go whats up I wanna know
I test the front row
Forgiven the giving while the living is living it up
So many people are sleeping while standing up
Not dressed to impress or fess it
Thats it test to the brain like FedEx
Treated one and the same beause the name of the game
Dont give em checks above necks
Some dont realize were on the same side
Subdity in the city suburbs or projects
But were living in a different time
Some speed some lead while some just pump rhymes
Then again were all in the same gang
Info to flow and heal all below
Lets go and find the piece of mind thats taken
Or else the black starts breakin
