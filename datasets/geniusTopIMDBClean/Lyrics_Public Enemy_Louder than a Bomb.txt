They claim were products from the bottom of hell
Cause the black is back and its bound to sell
Picture us cooling out on the Fourth of July
And if you heard we were celebrating thats a worldwide lie
Yo Chuck the fat generals man trying to pull a 226 on you G Yo man show em what you got
This style seems wild
Wait before you treat me like a stepchild
Let me tell you why they got me on file
Cause I give you what you lack come right and exact
Our status is the saddest so I care where you at black
And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tappin my telephone
I never live alone I never walk alone
My posses always ready and theyre waitin in my zone
Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be knowin the scheme that of the president
Tappin my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doing harm cause Im louder than a bomb
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
I am a rockhard trooper to the bone the bone the bone
Full grown consider me  stone
Once again and I say it for you to know
The troop is always ready I yell Geronimo
Your CIA you see I aint kiddin
Both King and X they got rid of both
A story untold true but unknown
Professor Griff knows Yo I aint milquetoast
And not the braggin or boastin and plus it aint no secret
Why theyre tappin my phone although I cant keep it a secret
So I decided to kick it yo
And yes it weighs a ton I say it once again
Im called the enemy Ill never be a friend
Of those with closed minds dont know Im rapid
The way that I rap it Is makin em tap it yeah
Never servin em well cause Im an unTom
Its no secret at all cause Im louder than a bomb
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder   Yeah 
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
Its yours 


Cold holdin the load the burden breakin the mold
I aint lyin denyin because theyre checkin my code
Am I buggin cause theyre buggin my phone  for information
No tellin whos sellin out  power buildin the nation so
Joinin the set the pointblank target
Every brothers inside so least not you forget no
Takin the blame is not a waste here taste
A bit of the song so you can never be wrong
Just a bit of advice cause we be payin the price
Cause every brother mans life is like swingin the dice right
Here it is once again this is the brother to brother
The Terminator the cutter
Goin on an on  leave alone the grown
Get it straight in 88 an Ill troop it to demonstrate
The posse always ready  98 at 98
My posse come quick because my posse got velocity
Tappin my phone never leave me alone
Im even lethal when Im unarmed
Cause Im louder than a bomb
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder   Yeah 
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
Come on come on  Louder 
Right 
Cause the D is for dangerous you can come and get some of this
I teach and speak so when its spoke its no joke
The voice of choice the place shakes with bass
Called one for the treble  The rhythm is the rebel
Heres a funky rhyme that theyre tappin on
Just thinkin Im breakin the beats Im rappin on
CIA FBI all they tell us is lies
And when I say it they get alarmed
Cause Im louder than a bomb
