Every black person who says that theyre a leader needs to pen blazing questions about HIV
And get an answer to the question How could it be in a book published in 1969
Under chemical and biological warfare
Tell em
Man to man I dont know if they can
From what I know the parts dont fit  Ah shit 
How hes sharin a needle with a drug addict
He dont believe he has it  Either 
But now he does he doesnt know
Cause he goes straight to a ho
Tell you what who was next on the butt
Wild thingin on a germ runnin wild
Yo stop But the bag popped
Damn
Yo Terminator man yo meet the G that killed me
