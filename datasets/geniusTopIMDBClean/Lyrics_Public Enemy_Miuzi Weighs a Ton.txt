Yo Chuck run a power move on em
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah step back get away give the brother some room
You got to all turn me up when the beat goes boom
Lyric to lyric line to line
And then you yall understand my reputation for rhyme
Cause my rhyme reputation depends on what
Style of record my DJ cuts
His slice and dice super mix so nice
So bad you wont dispute the price
Cause its plain to see its a strain to be
Number one in the public eye enemy
Cause Im wanted in fifty almost in fiftyone
States where the posse got me on the run
Its a big wonder why I havent gone under
Dodgin all types of microphone thunder
A fugitive missin all types of hell
All this because I talk so well
When I
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
The match up title the expression of thrill
For elite to compete and attempt to get ill
If looks could kill Id chill until
All the public catches on to my material you know
The ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
Cant wait to read the headlines of my capture
Accused of assault a first degree crime
Cause I beat competitors with my rhyme
Tongue whipped pushed shoved and tripped
Choked from the hold of my kung fu grip
And if you want my title it would be suicidal
From my end it would be homicidal
When I do work you get destroyed
All the paranoid know to avoid
The Public Enemy seat Ive enjoyed
This is no kid and Im not no toy boy


Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Im a Public Enemy but I dont rob banks
I dont shoot bullets and I dont shoot blanks
My style is supreme number one is my rank
And I got more power than the New York Yanks
If my Uzi wasnt heavy I would probably fire it
Make you walk the plank if I was a pirate
If they made me a king I would be a tyrant
If you want to get me go ahead and try it
Snatcher dispatcher biter never been a
Instead of takin me out take a girl to dinner
The level of comp has never been thinner
Its a runaway race where Im the winner
Its unreal they call the law
And claimed I had started a war
It was war they wanted and war they got
But they wilted in the heat when my Uzi got hot
When I
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
My style versatile said without rhymes
Which is why theyre after me and on my back
Lookin over my shoulder  seein what I write
Hearin what I say then wonderin why
Why they cant ever compete on my level
Superstar status is my domain
Understand my rhythm my pattern of lecture
And then youll know why Im on the run
This change of events results in a switch
Its the lateral movement of my vocal pitch
It eliminates pressure on the haunted
But the posse is around so I got to front it
Plus employ tactics so coy
And leave no choice but to destroy
Soloists groups and what they say
And all that try to cross my way
When I
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Rock  get up  get down
Miuzi weighs a ton
Hold it
Yeah thats right
