Have you forgotten that once we were brought here we were robbed of our name robbed of our language We lost our religion our culture our God And many of us by the way we act we even lost our minds
Here it is bam
And you say Goddamn this is the dope jam
But lets define the term called dope
And you think it mean funky now no
Here is a true tale
While the ones that deal are the ones that fail  Yeah 
Yeah you can move if you wanna move
What it prove Its here like the groove
The problem is this we gotta fix it
Check out the justice and how they run it
Selling smelling sniffing riffing
And brothers try to get swift and
Sell their own rob a home
While some shrivel to bone
Like comatose walking around
Please dont confuse this with the sound

From a corner from a brother keep another below
Stop illin and killing stop grillin

Standing on line checking the time homeboys playing the curb
The same ones that used to do herb  Yo Herb 
Now theyre gone passing it on
Poison attack  the Black word bond  Word word 
My man DaddyO once said to me
He knew a brother that stayed all day in his Jeep
And at night he went to sleep
And in the morning all he had was sneakers on his feet
The culprit used to jam and rock the mike
Yo he stripped the Jeep to fill his pipe
And wander around to find a place
Where they rocked to a different kind of
Come on yall
