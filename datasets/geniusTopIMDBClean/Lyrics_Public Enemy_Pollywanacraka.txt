She wants a lover right now
But not no brother
Her man gotta have a lot of money
To get under her cover
Now shes a fine sister
But up here shes missin it
She says she wanna learn about life
Not old black bull shit
At the age of 15 a brother gave her a baby
Shes 19 now and it drove her crazy
Thats why every time she turns around
All the people in the neighborhood
Look and get mad and sing
Polly
Polly wanna
Polly
Polly wanna
Thats what they say
Polly
Polly wanna
Meet Mr Successful I guess hes blessed yeah
But he happens to be a brother who only wants blue eyes and blonde hair
Now this young mister he dont like sisters
He couldnt find that special one we know why he missed her
He says sisters wasnt good enough
They only wanted his green stuff
Thats why every time he turned around
All the people in the neighborhood looked and got mad and sang
Polly
Polly wanna
Polly wanna
I try to tell my people
There should not be any hatred
For a brother or a sister
Whose opposite race theyve mated
Cus no man is God
And God put us all here  yeah 
But this system has no wisdom
The devil split us in pairs
And taught us White is good Black is bad
And Black and White is still too bad
Thats why everytime I turn around
All the people in my neighborhood
Look and get mad and sing
Polly wanna
Lord have mercy
Peace be upon us
Polly wanna
And you and you too
Get it together
