And you thought the beat slowed down cmon
Power to the people 
Get on up get into it get involved
Feel the bass as the cut revolves
To the brothers wit the 808
Like I said before PE got a brand new funk
Turn it up boom the trunk yeah
Internationally known on the microphone
Makin sure the brothers will never leave you alone
To my sisters
Sisters yes we missed ya
Lets get it together make a nation
You can bet on it dont sleep on it
Cause the troops cold jeepin it pumpin
Power to the people 
Turn us loose we shall overcome
They say where you get that bass from
Hey ohh people people as we continue on
Come along sings this song are you ready for 91
Rhythm nation pump that bass an
We like to know from Chicago New York and LA
Are yall ready cause the plans in the jam
And were ready to roll yo yall got to tell me
Are yall ready to go cmon
Power to the people 
Had to kick it like that as we roll as one
One under the sun to all the cities and to the side
Brothers and sister stateside and the whole wide world
There it is
Peace 1991
