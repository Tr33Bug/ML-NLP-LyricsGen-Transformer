Youre quite hostile
I got a right to be hostile man my people are being persecuted
Chuck Chuck Chuck run run run a power move on them
With vice I hold the mic device
With force I keep it away of course
And Im keeping you from sleeping
And on a stage I rage and Im rollin
And to the poor I pour in on in metaphors
Im not bluffing its nothing that we aint did before
We played you stayed the points made
You consider it done by the prophets of rage
Power of the people say 
Yo Griff you and S1Ws get to the East side
We gotta kick it to the East side G
I roll with the punches so I survive
Try to rock cause it keeps the crowd alive
Im not ballin Im just callin
But Im past the days of yesyallin
I wiggle round and round I pump you jump up
Hear my words my verbs and get  Juiced up juiced up 
I been around a while you cant describe my sound
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Power of the people say 
Ay yo Griff we gotta get to my man Ralph in the South
Lets kick it to the South side G
I rang ya bell can you tell I got feeling
A just peace at least cause I want it
I want it so bad that Im starving
Im like Garvey so you can see B
Its like that Im like Nat leave me the hell alone
If you dont think Im a brother then check my chromosome
And then you check the stage I declare it a new age
Get down for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like this

Ay yo kick it for the West side
You back the track you find were the quotable
You emulate  brothers sisters thats beautiful
Follow a path of positivity you go
Some sing it or rap it or harmonize it through gogo
Little you know but very seldom I do party jams
About a plan Im considered the man
Im the recordable God made it affordable
I say it you play it back in your car even portable
Stereo stereo  Describes my scenario
Left or right Black or White
Attack lies in the books that youre readin
Its knowledge of yourself that youre needin
Im like Vesey or Prosser we have a reason why
To debate the hate thats why were born to die
Mandela cell dweller Thatcher
You can tell her clear the way for the prophets of rage

Yo yo North side North side G
Its raw and keeping you on the floor
Its soul and keeping you in control
Its part two cause Im pumping what youre used to
Till the whole Juice Crew gets me in my goose down
I do the rebel yell  And Im a Duracell 
I call it plain insane brothers causing me pain
When a brothers a victim
And the sellers a dweller in a cage
Yo rock the acapella G 
Power of the people say 
Youre quite hostile
