Public Enemy No 1 Lyrics
Yo Chuck bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio you know what Im saying
And this brother stopped me and asked me Yo whats up with that brother Chuckie D he swear he nice
I said Yo the brother dont swear he nice he knows hes nice you know what Im saying
So Chuck we got a feeling you turning into a Public Enemy man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me on the way out to LA Laurelton Queens while we was in the car on our way to the shop
Well yo right now kick the bass for them brothers and let em know What goes on
What goes on Well
Im all in put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
One two three down for the count
The result of my lyrics oh yes no doubt
Cold rock rap fortyniner supreme
Is what I choose and I use I never lose to a team
Cause I can go solo like a Tyson bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers ducks hohum emcees
You cant rock the kid so go cut the cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My raps red hot hundred ten degrees
So dont start bassing Ill start placing
Bets on that youll be disgracing
You and your mind from my beating from my rhymes
A time for a crime that I cant find
Ill show you my gun my Uzi weighs a ton
Because Im Public Enemy number one
One one one
One one one one
One one one hoohah 
You got no rap but you want to battle
Its like having a boat but youve got no paddle
Cause I never pause I say it because
I dont break in stores but I break all laws
Written while sitting all bidding not hidden
Giving me the juice that youre not getting
Im not a law obeyer so you can tell your mayor
Im a nonstop rhythm rock poetry sayer
Im the rhyme player the ozone layer
A battle what Heres a bible start your prayer
This word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened just admit you lied
You just got caught up for going out of order
And now youre serving football teams their water
You messed with the Master word to Chuck
And I waxed cold taxed make sure you got dunked
You just got dissed all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees you get me pissed
Its no fun being on the run
Because they got me Public Enemy number one
One one one
One one one one
Dont you know dont you know
I got a posse of a force to back me up
Watch out we got mettle to match
Ambush attack on my back doubleteam you get creamed
So we have it so you wont catch
Wanna hear it again We got a force enemy down
The LI circuit sound
And Chuckie D myself and KJee
Flavor DJ MeloD
Oh yes I presume its the tunes that make us groom
To make all the ladies swoon
But its also the words from our direction the homeboy section
Kicking like Bruce Lees Chinese Connection
On stereo never ever mono
On wax yes Im talking about vinyl
They said Stop Freeze I got froze up
Because Im Public Enemy number one
One one one
One one one
One one one
For all you
Suckers liars your cheap amplifiers
Your crossed up wires are always starting fires
You grown up criers now heres a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires your father fixes tires
You try to sell your equipment but you get no buyers
Its you they never hire youre never on flyers
Cause you and your crew is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic political lyrical son
Im Public Enemy number one
One one one
One one one
One one one
Yeah thats right Chuck man
Thats what you gotta do
You gotta tell em just like that you know what Im saying
Cause yo man let me tell you a little something man
These brothers running around hard headed
They get a little jealous you know what Im saying
Just like that you know theyre trying to bring you down with them
But yo Chuck you got to let them know whos who in the world to be
You got to let them know that this is the 80s
And we can get all the ladies
And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes
And thats the way the story goes
Thats just the way the story goes
Let me tell you a little something man
