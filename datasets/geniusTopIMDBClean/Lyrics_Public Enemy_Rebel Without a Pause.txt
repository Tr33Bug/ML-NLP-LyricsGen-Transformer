Brothers and sisters Brothers and sisters I dont know what this world is coming to
Yes the rhythm the rebel
Without a pause Im lowering my level
The hard rhymer  where you never been Im in
You want stylin You know its time again
D the enemy tellin you to hear it
They praised the music this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album The Show
Bum Rush the sound  I made a year ago
I guess you know you guess Im just a radical
Not on sabbatical yes to make it critical
The only party your body should be partyin to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you
Ay yo Chuck man I dont understand this man
Yo you got to slow down man you losin them
Radiosuckers never play me
On the mix they just okay me
Now known and grown when theyre clocking my zone its known
Snaking and taking everything that a brother owns
Hard  my calling card
Recorded and ordered supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud kicking live next poet supreme
Loop a troop bazooka the scheme
Flavor  A rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime
They on my time ticket
Ay yo Chuck they think we takin shorts
Show em this is cold medina man
Come on kick it
Terminator X Terminator X
Terminator X Terminator
Yo Chuck you gettin em nervous
They cant handle this they gonna break down
From a rebel its final on black vinyl
Soul rock and roll coming like a rhino
Tables turn suckers burn to learn
They cant disable the power of my label
Def Jam tells you who I am
The enemys public they really give a damn
Strong Island where I got em whylin
Thats the reason theyre claiming that Im violent
Never silent no dope getting dumb  nope
Claiming where we get our rhythm from
Number one we hit ya and we give ya some
No gun and still never on the run
You wanna be an S1  Griff will tell you when
And then youll come again youll know what time it is
Impeach the president pulling out my ray gun
Zap the next one I could be your Shogun
Suckers  dont last a minute
Soft and smooth I aint with it
Hardcore  raw bone like a razor
Im like a laser I just wont graze ya
Old enough to raise ya so thisll faze ya
Get it right boy maybe I will praise ya
Playing the role I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
Smooth  Not what I am
Rough  Cause Im a man
No matter what the name were all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
Yeah  The voice of power
Is in the house  go take a shower boy
PE a group a crew  not singular
We wear black Wranglers
Were rap stranglers you cant angle us
I know youre listening
I caught you pissin your pants
Youre scared of dissing us
The crowd is missing us
Were on a mission yall
Yo Chuck yo Yeah man
Yo you got em runnin scared
Terminator X Terminator X
Terminator X Terminator
Attitude when Im on fire
Juice on the loose electric wire
Simple and plain give me the lane
Ill throw it down your throat like Barkley
You see my car keys youll never get these
They belong to the NineEight posse
You want some more son You wanna get some
Bumrush the door of the store  pick up the album
You know the rhythm the rhyme plus the beat is designed
So I can enter your mind boys
Bring the noise  my time
Step aside for the flex Terminator X
Yeah thats right
This jam is rated cold medina boy
Thats right cold medina thats right
We showin up in EFFECT also known as effect
You understand what Im sayin
Yeah Yeah boy
Bring that beat back
Bring that beat back one more time Chuck
Yall wanna hear that beat right
Bring that beat back
