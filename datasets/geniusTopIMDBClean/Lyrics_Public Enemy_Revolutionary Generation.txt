I get down to what it is
And if it aint funky  Round round roundround 
See ya  Round 
People askin me whats goin on my mind
Huh  Hey 
Wait a minute
The true worth of a race must be measured by the character of its woman
Just a matter of race
Cause a black males in their face
Step back for the new jack swing
On the platter scatter huh
We got our own thing 
Yes just jam let the rhythm run  Boy 
Day to day America eats its young
And defeats our women
There is a gap so wide we all can swim in
Drown in  Uh get down  and get it
Got it goin on with it
Sister  hey  soul sister we goin be all right
It takes a man to take a stand
Understand it takes a woman to make a stronger man
As we both get strong 
Theyll call me a crazy Asiatic while Im singin a song
Oh oh  Oh my God oh my lord I cant hold back
So I get exact on a track
Its an eye for eye tooth for tooth
Forget about me just set my sister free  Sisters 
RESPECT
My sisters not my enemy
Cause well be stronger together to make them all say
Damn  This generation 


I dont know what this worlds coming to 
They dont know what we got goin is  sound 
See you  To turn it all around
To my sisters I communicate with the bass and tone
Thru speakers and the microphone
Cause Im tired of America dissin my sisters
For example like they dissed Tawana 
And they try to say that shes a liar
My people dont believe it but even now theyre getting higher
Off the feeling inspiration
We must know that in this nation
Every single generation
They teach us how to diss our sisters 
Strange as you say I say revolution
Need for change brings a revolution
The great book look see solution
God chooses what and who for the bruisin
Theres been no justice for none of my sisters
Just us been the one thats been missin her
Now we got to protect
To get together and damn  This generation 
I said so to what it is
Where it is she needs a lil respect  There it is 
I would say she needs a lotta
Brother from a mother like me has gotta
Give it up  Give it now 
And pass it all around to my soul sister
They disrespected mama and treated her like dirt
America took her reshaped her raped her
No it never made the paper
Beat us mated us
Made us attack our woman in black
So I said sophisticated B  Dont be one 
Not to heed the warning crack of dawn
Or is it the dawn of crack  Uh oh 
Stop the talk they say but we talk and say whats right or wrong
Some say we wasting time singing a song
But why is it that were many different shades
Black womans privacy invaded years and years
You cannot count my mamas tears
Its not the past the futures what she fears
Strong we be strong the next generation
Its what not who were facin
The fingers pointed to us in our direction
The blind state of mind needs correction
Word to the mother we tighten connection
To be a man you need no election
This generation generates a new attitude  Yeah 
Sister to you we should not be rude
So we come together
And make em all say damn  This generation
