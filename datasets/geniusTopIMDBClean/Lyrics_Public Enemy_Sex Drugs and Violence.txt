We like those gangsta rhymes
Just make sure they dont corrupt our minds
These rappers kill and thieve
A lot of times its only make believe
Once upon a time not long ago
A rapper got shot and no one knows
Who pulled the trigger on the kid and laid him in his grave
And after the prayers and the street parade
Shit got forgot and now hes dead
And all the fans loved everything he said
So understand this you dont wanna miss
Sex drugs and violence
We like those gangsta rhymes
Just make sure they dont corrupt our minds
These rappers kill and thieve
A lot of times its only make believe
Ayy yo once upon a time in Jamaica Queens
An icon gets shot and no one knew what it means
It was just another murder scene but lets get on with the bling bling
Chingching and half naked chicks that cant sing
Murder weapon never found police never around
The respect the intellect and the suspect all out of town
Its all out of bounds KRS Chuck D makin our rounds man
While they takin us down man
Were takin you down I got another new sound
Its really an old sound but you know how me and Chuck get down
We got peace love unity and having the fun
But you all want sex drugs violence 101
Here it is bam 
Stop being a little boy with a little toy stand up and be a man
Now you see the plan from west to east
Instead of sex drugs and violence we got love purpose and peace
We be hurtin the least we be workin no seats
Bringing it to America like Geronimo and Cochise
Get that but make sure when you spit rap
If you aint really ready to die yo dont spit that


We like those gangsta rhymes
Just make sure they dont corrupt our minds
These rappers kill and thieve
A lot of times its only make believe
Once upon a time I was on Long Island
A man got shot and he wasnt smilin
He was bleedin from his guts yo
A policeman was sittin and he drove up on the spot yo
Now when police light came on
When the man died who was the blame on
Wasnt me Not you
I didnt kill nobody cause my records dont do that
I make the records for the kids
Gangsta rap flippin peoples kids lids
We like those gangsta rhymes
Just make sure they dont corrupt our minds
These rappers kill and thief
A lot of times its only make believe
