Youre blind baby
Youre blind from the facts on who you are
Cause youre watching that garbage
The woman makes the men all pause
And if you got a woman she might make you forget yours
Theres a fiveletter word to describe her character
But her brains being washed by an actor
And every real man that tries to approach
Come the closer he comes he gets dissed like a roach
I dont think I can handle she goes channel to channel
Cold looking for that hero she watch channel zero
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
Zero
Yo baby you got to cut that garbage off
Yo I wanna watch the game
What is you doing
Hey yo let me tell you a little something
Imma take all your soaps and then Im gonna hang em on a rope
You know what Im saying
Cause that garbage youre watching dont make no sense
Hey yo let me tell you a little something baby
Imma take your set and Imma throw it out the window G
2 7 5 4 8 she watched she said
All added up to zero and nothing in her head
She turns and turns and she hopes the soaps
Are for real she learns that it aint true nope
But she wont survive and rather die in a lie
Fall a fool for some dude on a tube
I dont think I can handle she goes channel to channel
Cold looking for that hero she watch channel zero
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch

Yo baby you think Im joking Do I look like Im joking

Yo cut that garbage off now
Yo I got the Tyson fight on you know what Im saying
Yo so you cant be coming here staganating like that you know what Im saying
Yo we getting ready to watch the Super Bowl
We got a black quarterback so step back
Trouble vision for a sister cause I know she dont know I quote
Her brains been trained by a twentyfour inch remote
Revolution a solution for all of our children
But her children dont mean as much as the show I mean
Watch her worship the screen and fiend
For a TV ad and it just makes me mad
I dont think I can handle she goes channel to channel
Cold looking for that hero she watch channel zero
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch
She watch she watch she watch she watch

Youre blind from the facts on who you are
Cause youre watching that garbage
Youre blind baby
