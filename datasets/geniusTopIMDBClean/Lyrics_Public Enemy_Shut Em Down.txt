Hold it now
Oh Come on come on
Huh Alright yall
I testified my mama cried
Black people died when the other man lied
See the TV listen to me double trouble
I overhaul and Im coming from the lower level
Im taking tabs sho nuff stuff to grab
Like shirts and it hurts with a neck to wreck
Took a poll cause our soul took a toll
From the education of a TV station
But look around here go the sound of the wrecking ball
Boom and pound when I shut em down
I shut em down  Shut em down shut em shut em down 
I shut em down  Shut em down shut em shut em down 
I shut em down  Shut em down shut em shut em down

Huh Alright yall
Alright
One two three four five six seven eight nine
What I use in the battle for the mind
Hit it hard like it suppose pull no blows to the nose
Like Uncle L said Im rippin up shows
Then what it is is only five percent of the biz Im adding woes
Thats the way it goes
Then you think I rank I never drank point blank
I own loans suckers got me running from the bank
Civil liberty I cant see to pay a fee
I never saw a way to pay a sap to read the law
Then become a victim of a lawyer
Dont know ya never saw ya
Tape cued getting me sued
Playing games with my head what the judge said
Put me in the red got me thinking bout a trigger to the lead
No no my educated mind say
Suckers gonna pay anyway there gonna be a day
Cause the troop they roll in to posse up whole from the ground
Ready to go throw another round
Sick of the ride its suicide for the other side of town
When I find a way to shut em down
I shut em down  Shut em down shut em shut em down 
I shut em down  Shut em down shut em shut em down 
I shut em down  Shut em down shut em shut em down 
I shut em down  Shut em down shut em shut em down

Hey
Who count the money in the neighborhood
But we spending money to no end looking for a friend
In a war to the core ripping up the poor in the stores
Until they get a brother kicking down doors
Then I figure I can get bigger look em dead in the eye
And they wince defense is pressurized
They dont really want it to be another racial attack
In disguise so give some money back

All corporations owe they gotta give up the dough
To my town or else we gotta shut em down
