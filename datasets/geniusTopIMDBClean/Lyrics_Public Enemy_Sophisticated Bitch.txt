That woman in the corner cold playin the role
Leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold
Knowin for a fact that girl is whack
If you hold your hand out shell turn her back
Better walk dont talk shes all pretend
Cant be her friend unless you spend
Wall to wall after all
Get ready to throw only money at the bitch
Cause she thinks shes
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
Peekin and seekin inside a book
Her demands for a man with a chemical look
Wishes and desires getting worse with age
She dont want a man all she wants is a page
Aint got a man so she goes to a club
She think its classy but its really a pub
But thats the kind of place where she likes to go
The bitch got a problem
Cause she thinks shes
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
Jackets shoes everyday ties
The girl only wants one of those guys
Suckers who front like it aint no thing
Pretend to be friends dont want that thang
Talk like this uh dont talk slang
Do anything to get that thang
Tries to be chic and playin it off
Peekin through the window I saw her take her clothes off
Nasty girl a stone cold freak
Stayin in the bed a whole goddamn week
Comin and leavin guys servin up storms
From execs with checks boys from the dorms
Never kept a name never seen a face
She could pass em in the street like it never took place
I know shes a ho so Ima go
Expose the funky bitch
Cause she thinks shes


So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
Now she wants a sucker boy with an attache
And if you aint got it shell turn you away
You can smile with style as you profile
Cause you got a gold tooth and she thinks youre wild
She dont want a brother thats true and black
If youre light youre alright better you stay back
Cause the sucker with the bag is out the cat
With somethin in his bag keepin her attached
The man got a plan its IBM
The devil at her level yes it is him
His Audi she rides his gold and clothes
The ill base method turnin up her nose
Lack a lack a lack cold beamin her up
She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
Her status looks at us from down below
Now the bitch is in trouble
Cause she was
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
So Phisticated 
Little is known about her past
So listen to me cause I know her ass
Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes
And never got caught so the story goes
She kept doin that to all her men
Found the wrong man when she did it again
And still to this day people wonder why
Did he beat the bitch down til she almost died
Phisticated
