Hey Chuck we got some nonbelievers out there
Yo we got to do somethin about that man
Yo we got to get stupid
Yo we gotta let em know what time it is
You go ooh and aah when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
No matter who you are when Im up to par
I betcha go hip hop hurray or hurrah
But the aahs and oohs is my kind of news
Pop your tape in put your car in cruise
I never heard the boos I never drank booze
Cause I just rock the rhythm left alone the blues
The LI mystique you sneak to peek
A look and then you know that were never weak
I know you cant wait its never too late
No fear Im here and everything is straight
Cycles cycles life runs in cycles
New is old no Im not no psycho
The monkey on the back makes the best excel
The people in the crowd makes the rock well
The people in the back lets you know whos wack
And those who lack the odds are stacked
The one who makes the money is white not black
You might not believe it but it is like that
When you come to my show watch me throw
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
When you make a move new not used
And watch the bro here just bust a groove
A fat lady soprano loads my ammo
Hear my jam with a funky piano
Easy on the wall but hard on the panel
A fool smokes Kools cause he chokes on Camels
In effect the crews in check
Run by the posse with the gold around the neck
Homeboys in heat lookin for sweet
Ladies in the crowd so they can meet
Somebody to body makin a baby
Givin it to grandma then makin her crazy
Im a MC protector US defector
South African government wrecker
Panther power you can feel it in my arm
Lookout yall cause Im a timebomb
Tickin tockin all about rockin
Makin much dollars while the crazy ones clockin
The rhythm to shake the house downy down
Bounce to the ounce sound so crown
The man the enemy Public King no thing
All fall to the force of my swing
Like Ali Frazier Thriller in Manila
Pinpoint point blank microphone killer
Am I no need to lie got the Flavor Flav
To prove Ill win and if not the save
Ill pick up rack up put your whole shack up
Just choose to lose the bet emcee stick up
This is the wiz but the mics not his
Its mine one time let the star shine
And Im tellin you yellin at you youre through
Dont think youre grown cause your mustache grew
Im number one you know it weighs a ton
And Ill be the burger you can be the bun girl
Surroundin my steady poundin
Get on down to my funky sound and
Rock the rhythm rhyme one time your mind
Rhythm roll twotime control
The mauler and the caller of your doom
And when Im ready to leave youre gonna know I go boom
Three times yall rhythm rhyme and rock
Then youll that the D is on the block
Four times yall and never ever the wack
Its the hour to the minute time to blow black
