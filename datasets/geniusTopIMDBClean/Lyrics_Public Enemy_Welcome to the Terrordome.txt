Hey
This
This is a journey
jour
journey through sound
Would you join me please in welcomeining
Hahahaha
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Heres your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack then slapped the Mac
Now Im ready to mic it
You know I like it  huh
Hear my favoritism roll Oh
Never be a brother like Me go solo
Laser anesthesia maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way Im livin forgiven what Im givin up
X on the flex hit me now
I dont know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man Ive had it up to here
Yeah I wear got em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin some ways  Ways 
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows huh
Cause its coming from the heart
What I got better get some
Get on up hustler of culture
Snake bitten been spit in the face huh
But the rhymes keep fittin
Respects been given hows ya livin
Now I cant protect a paidoff defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call took the fall broke the laws
Not my fault that theyre fallin off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome
Come on down get down
Come on you can get it get it get it
Come on down get down
Come on you can get it get it get it
Come on down get down
Come on you can get it get it get it
Come on down get down
Come on you can get it get it get it
Would you join me please in welcomeining
So long now have a good trip
Yo yo who put this thing together huh Me
Me thats who
Who I trust Who I trust
Me thats who
Yo who you trust man
Subordinate terror kickin off an era
Cold deliverin pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Oh Chuck they out to get us man
Ohohoh ohohoh Chuck they out to get us man
Yo we gotta dust these boys off 
Crucifixion aint no fiction
Socalled chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing bring think reminisce
Bout a brother while Im in sync
Every brother aint a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb plus hard on the boulevard
Lies scandalizin basin
Traits of hate whos celebratin with Satan
I ropeadope the evil with righteous bobbin and weavin
And let the good get even
Cmon down  Cmon 
But welcome to the Terrordome
Caught in the race against time the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while Im bending em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design  Would you join me please in welcomeining 
Trying to blind the science Im sending em
How to fight the power cannot run and hide
But it shouldnt be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother aint a brother
Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
Its weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothin worse
Than a mothers pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Cant wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example one of many places
Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia
I dont smile in the line of fire I go wildin
But its on bass and drums even violins
Whatcha do getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad I put it down on a pad huh
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin fear of high rollin
God bless your soul and keep livin
Never allowed kickin it loud
Droppin a bomb brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team never move alone
But welcome to the Terrordome
