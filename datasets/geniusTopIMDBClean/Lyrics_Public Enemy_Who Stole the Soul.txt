Once again this is it
Turn it up here we go
But this time the rhymes
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then lets get down to the nittygritty
I wanna know who
Picked Wilsons pocket
After he rocked it
Fact he shocked it
Same kinda thing they threw at James  Brown 
And what they did to Redd was a shame
The bigger the Blacks get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that  booty
Intentional Rape System like we aint
Paid enough in this bitch thats why I dissed them
I learned we earned got no concern
Instead we burned where the hell is our return
Plain and simp the systems a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho who stole the soul
Aint no different than in South Africa
Over here theyll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo they say the Black dont know how to act  Who me 
Cause were waitin for the big payback
But we know itll never come
Thats why I say come and get some
Why when the Black moves in Jack moves out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Aint we all people
How the hell can a color be no good to a neighborhood
Help straighten me out
Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
Sayin Im wrong for singin a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
Try to be the best and
Let everybody know before I blow
Cuz I wanna know what sucka stole the soul
We choose to use their ways
And holidays notice some of them are heller days
Invented by those that never repented
For the sins within that killed my kin
But thats all right
I try do what a brother does
But Ill never know if youre my cuz
Thats why I try my best to unite
Damn the rest if they dont like it
Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
Has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him
40 acres and a mule Jack
Where is it whyd you try to fool the Black
It wasnt you but you pledge allegiance
To the red white and blue
Suckers that stole the soul
