Yo Bum rush the show yo Bum rush the show
Yo Bum rush the show yo Bum rush the show
I am taking no prisoners taking no shorts
Breakin with the metal of a couple of forts
While were hearin that boom supplement the mix
Were gonna rush em like the Bears in the 46
Homeboys I dont know but theyre part of the pack
In the plan against the man bum rush attack
For the suckers at the door if youre up and around
For the suckers at the door were gonna knock you right down
Yo Bum rush the show yo Bum rush the show
Yo Bum rush the show yo Bum rush the show
Yo what clown is this youre gonna tell us man
That we cant get inside your spot Yo man
Let me tell you somethin man we came all the way
Down here from the Welsh ya know what Im sayin
Yo man youre talkin about gettin busy yo you wanna
Get busy Come on lets step to the back ya know what Im sayin
I take you to the back and show you some of my techniques
And Ill stomp a mudhole in your ass bitch
Searchin my body for fuckin what
My guns just for fun and my knife dont cut
How can I make you understand
I get ill on a posse with my goddamn hands
Troubles not me I dont mean to cause
But you took one look and began to pause
Didnt holla at the dollar we was willin to spend
But you took one look wouldnt let our ass in
Yo Bum rush the show yo Bum rush the show
Yo Bum rush the show yo Bum rush the show
Yo holmes I dont know what youre talkin about man

Yo a nine aint gonna stop the bum rush holmes
Yo Bum rush the show yo Bum rush the show

Cold bum rushin doors like at first its something
All we realize that the show aint nothin
For the stunts and the blunts whole world inside
The reason that the mighty used force supplied
No comp well stomp all in our way
Gave me static so I dont pay
It might be a trick that you dont like
Comin in the side door then Im grabbin the mic
Walkin and talkin fistful in the air
It might seem like that we dont care
A ho for an oh a pow for an ow
Girls start screamin all I say is wow

Whip his monkey ass til it aint no fun
