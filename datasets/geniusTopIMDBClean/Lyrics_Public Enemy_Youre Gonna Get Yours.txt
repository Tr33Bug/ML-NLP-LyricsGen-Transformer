Oh Chuck they out to get us man
Yo we got to dust these boys off
In this corner with the 98
Subject of suckers object of hate
Whos the one some think is great
Im that one  son of a gun 
Drivin by wavin my fist
Makin em mad when Im goin like this
Top gun never on the run
They know not to come cause they all get some 
Goin quicker in the speedin lane
Jealous cant do it and its causin them pain
Caught in my smoke all they did was choke
Look at my spokes you know Im no joke
Out that window middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride stereo and blackwalls
Suckers they got the nerve and gall
To talk about the car when theyre walkin tall 
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
Youre gonna get yours 
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
Youre gonna get yours 
Pullin away every day
Leavin you in the dust so you know I get paid
On the mile ego trip and 50 tailin on my tip
Watch me burn rubber fall in my flame
This episode is always the same
Seein no comp coming like Im blind
All left back trailin my behind
I go faster cops try to shoot me
Theyll get theirs when they try to get me
Ill let it go my turbo
Run em in the river cause theyre movin too slow
Laughing hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charges me contempt
Id rub my boomerang cause Im feelin proud
And I wouldnt even hear em cause my radios loud
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
Youre gonna get yours 
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
Youre gonna get yours s


Cruisin down the boulevard
Im treated like some superstar
You know the time so dont look hard
Get with it the ultimate homeboy car 
All you suckers in the other ride
Whenever Im comin get to my side
My 98 is tough to chase
If youre on my tail better watch your face
Smoke is comin when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
Tinted windows so super bad
Lookin like the car the Green Hornet had
Its the reason Im ahead of the pack
Its the reason I left them back
Its the reason all the people say
My 98 Olds blows em all away
My 98 Oldsmobiles so  Su Su Su 
My 98 Oldsmobile is  Su Su Su 
My 98 Oldsmobiles so  Su Su Su 
My 98 Oldsmobiles like  Super sperm 
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
Youre gonna get yours 
Suckers to the side I know you hate my 98
Youre gonna get yours 
Understand I dont drive drunk
My 98s fly I dont drive no junk
No cop got a right to call me a punk
Take this ticket go to hell and stick it
Put me on a kick but line up times up
This government needs a tuneup
I dont even know whats happenin whats up
Gun in my chest Im under arrest
Sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Took the girls and got them to thrill me
Stepped outside got in my ride
Drove em around and I looked around town
Caught em out there cold ran em over and down
They didnt get me and thats the truth
Cause my 98O is bulletproof 
My 98 Oldsmobiles so  Su Su Su 
My 98 Oldsmobile is  Su Su Su 
My 98 Oldsmobiles so  Su Su Su 
My 98 Oldsmobiles like  Super sperm
