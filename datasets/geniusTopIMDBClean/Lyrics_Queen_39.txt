In the year of 39
Assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back never feared never cried
Dont you hear my call
Though youre many years away
Dont you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of 39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day and they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weight
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darling well away but my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though Im older but a year
Your mothers eyes from your eyes cry to me
Dont you hear my call
Though youre many years away
Dont you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
Dont you hear my call
Though youre many years away
Dont you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life still ahead pity me
