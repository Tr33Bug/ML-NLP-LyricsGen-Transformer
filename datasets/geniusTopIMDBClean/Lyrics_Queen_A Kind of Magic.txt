Its a kind of magic
Its a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream one soul
One prize one goal
One golden glance of what should be
Its a kind of magic 
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
Its a kind of magic 
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
Its a kind of magic 
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
Is this a kind of magic
Its a kind of magic 
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
Im hearing secret harmonies
Its a kind of magic 
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
Its a kind of magic 
Its a kind of magic 
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be will soon be
Will soon be done
This is  this is  a kind  a kind 
Of magic  yeah 
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done  done
