Ooh lets go
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Aint no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready Hey are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust yeah
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think Im going to get along
Without you when youre gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust


Hey
Oh take it
Bite the dust hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust ow
Another one bites the dust hey hey
Another one bites the dust heyeheh
Ooh
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him you can cheat him you can treat him bad
And leave him when hes down yeah
But Im ready yes Im ready for you
Im standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust yeah
Hey Im gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out
Ayyeah
