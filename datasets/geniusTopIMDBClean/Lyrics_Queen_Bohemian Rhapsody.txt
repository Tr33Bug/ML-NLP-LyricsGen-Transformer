Is this the real life Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see
Im just a poor boy I need no sympathy
Because Im easy come easy go little high little low
Any way the wind blows doesnt really matter to me to me
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head pulled my trigger now hes dead
Mama life had just begun
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away
Mama ooh didnt mean to make you cry
If Im not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine bodys aching all the time
Goodbye everybody Ive got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama ooh  Any way the wind blows 
I dont wanna die
I sometimes wish Id never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche Scaramouche will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Galileo  Galileo  Galileo  Galileo Galileo Figaro magnifico
But Im just a poor boy nobody loves me
Hes just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah No we will not let you go
Let him go  Bismillah We will not let you go
Let him go  Bismillah We will not let you go
Let me go  Will not let you go
Let me go  Will not let you go
Never never never never let me go  Ah
No no no no no no no
Oh mamma mia mamma mia  Mamma mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby cant do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here
Ooh 
Ooh yeah ooh yeah 
Nothing really matters anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
