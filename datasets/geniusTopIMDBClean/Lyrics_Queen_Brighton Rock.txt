Happy little day Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made so decorously laid
Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
Its so good to know theres still a little magic in the air
Ill weave my spell
Jenny will you stay tarry with me pray
Nothing eer need come between us
Tell me love what do you say
Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover
How I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
Ill say farewell
Oh Rock of Ages
Do not crumble love is breathing still
Oh Lady Moon shine down
A little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away writes a letter everyday
We must ever be together
Nothing can my love erase
Oh no Im compromised I must apologize
If my lady should discover
How I spent my holidays
Ooh
Ooh oohhoohoohoohoo
