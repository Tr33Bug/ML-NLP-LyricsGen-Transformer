Ah youre taking all the sunshine away
And making out like youre the main line I knew that
Cause youre a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh just cruising
Driving along with the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart haahn

Ooh youre a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh youre alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Ooh messing with the beat of my heart yeah

Mm making such a deal of life
Ooh you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen happen

Slow down
Ah you really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove yeah
