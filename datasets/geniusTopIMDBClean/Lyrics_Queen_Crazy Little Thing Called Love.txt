This thing called love
I just cant handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it I aint ready
Crazy little thing called love
Athis thing  This thing 
Called love  Called love 
It cries  Like a baby 
In a cradle all night
It swings  Woo woo 
It jives  Woo woo 
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
Woo I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock n roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool relax get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat hitchhike
And take a long ride
On my motorbike until Im ready
Crazy little thing called love

I gotta be cool relax get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat
Hitchhike  Ah hum ah hum 
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until Im ready  Ready Freddie
