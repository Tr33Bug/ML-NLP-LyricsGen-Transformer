Death on Two Legs  Dedicated to  Lyrics
Ah  You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
Youve taken all my money and you want more
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrowminded cronies
Who are fools of the first division
Death on two legs
Youre tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own
Killjoy bad guy
Big talking small fry
Youre just an old barrow boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me
Can you face me
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good Are you satisfied
Do you feel like suicide  I think you should 
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night
Do you feel good  Feel good 
Ah  Talk like a big business tycoon
Youre just a hot air balloon
So no one gives you a damn
Youre just an overgrown schoolboy
Let me tan your hide
Dog with disease
Youre the king of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is
Mr KnowAll was the fin on your back part of the deal
Shark
Death on two legs
Tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart  You never did 
Of your own  Right from the start 
Insane should be put inside
Youre a sewer rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Make yourself null and void
Make me feel good  I feel good
