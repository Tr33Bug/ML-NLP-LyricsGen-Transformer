Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are created
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash
And leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike
What you need is a rest
Its not easy love
But you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When youre in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When youre through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end
Now its a beautiful day
The postman delivered
A letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You try to track him down
But somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
Youre getting used to life
Without him in your way
Its so easy now
Cause you got friends you can trust


Friends will be friends
When youre in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When youre through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end
Its so easy now
Cause you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When youre in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When youre through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end
Friends will be friends
When youre in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When youre through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Cause right till the end
Friends will be friends yeah
