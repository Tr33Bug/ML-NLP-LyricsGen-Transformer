I can dim the lights and sing you songs
Full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play
On your heart strings
Be a Valentino just for you
Ooh love ooh lover boy
Whatre you doing tonight Hey boy
Set my alarm turn on my charm
Thats because Im a good oldfashioned lover boy
Ooh let me feel
Your heartbeat  Grow faster faster 
Ooh can you feel my love heat  Ohh 
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after all
Id like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word your wish is my command
Ooh love ooh lover boy
Whatre you doing tonight Hey boy
Write my letter feel much better
Ill use my fancy patter on the telephone
When Im not with you think of you always
I miss you  I miss those long hot summer nights 
When Im not with you think of me always
Love you love you
Hey boy where do you get it from
Hey boy where did you go
I learned my passion in the good oldfashioned
School of lover boys
Dining at the Ritz well meet at nine
One two three four five six seven eight nine oclock  precisely
I will pay the bill you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine  Come on and get it 
Ooh love  There he goes again 
Ooh lover boy  Whos my good Oldfashioned lover boy 
Ooh ooh 
Whatre you doing tonight Hey boy
Everythings all right just hold on tight
Thats because Im a good old
Fashioned  Fashioned  lover boy
