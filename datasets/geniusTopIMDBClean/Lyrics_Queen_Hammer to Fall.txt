Yeah
Here we stand or here we fall
History wont care at all
Make the bed light the light yeah
Lady Mercy wont be home tonight yeah
You dont waste no time at all 
Dont hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all 
Yeah were just waiting
For the hammer to fall yeah
Oh every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles
As your body decays yeah
Tow your line and play their game 
Yeah let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name 
You know its time for the hammer to fall yeah
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same
Yeah baby  Oh no oh no 
Oh lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane  Oh no 
Baby baby now your struggle is all in vain
For he who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices cant be heard
We just wanna scream it louder
And louder and louder


What the hell we fighting for 
Oh just surrender and it wont hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers 
Eh while youre waiting
For the hammer to hammer to fall
Hey its
Its gonna fall
Hammer you know
Yeah hammer to fall
Woo Yeah yeah
Woo woo
Ha yeah waiting
For the hammer to fall now baby
Yeah yeah
While youre waiting
For the hammer to fall ooh
Give it to me one more time
