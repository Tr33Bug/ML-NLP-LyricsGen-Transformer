I want it all  Hey yeah  I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger
Cant see a way out
It aint much Im asking
I heard him say
Got to find me a future
Move out of my way
I want it all I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
I want it all I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
Listen all you people come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan
Gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People do you hear me
Just give me the sign
It aint much Im asking
If you want the truth
Heres to the future
For the dreams of youth

Give it all I want it all 
I want it all and I want it now  Hey

And wheres and whys and living lies
So Im living it all  Yes Im living it all 
And Im giving it all
And Im giving it all ooh yeah
