When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something
Youre missing that one final screw
Youre simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you havent got a clue
Im going slightly mad
Im going slightly mad
It finally happened happened
It finally happened ohwoah
It finally happened Im slightly mad
Oh dear hahaha
Im one card short of a full deck
Im not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
Im not at my usual top billing
Im coming down with a fever
Im really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think Im a banana tree
Oh dear
Im going slightly mad
Im going slightly mad
It finally happened happened
Finally happened uh huh
Finally happened Im slightly mad
Oh dear
Ooooahah ooohahah
Im knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast its true
Im driving only three wheels these days
But my dear how about you
Im going slightly mad
Im going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened oh yes
It finally happened Im slightly mad
Just very slightly mad
And there you have it
