The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons apumping
And the hubcaps all gleam
When Im holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hands on your grease gun
Oh its like a disease son
Im in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal
Told my girl Ill have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks
Saying This is the end now
Cars dont talk back
Theyre just fourwheeled friends now
When Im holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When Im cruising in overdrive
Dont have to listen
To no runofthemill talk jive
Im in love with my car  Ooh Im in love with my car 
Got to feel for my automobile  Ooh 
Im in love with my car  Ooh Im in love with my car 
String back gloves
In my automolove  Ooh
