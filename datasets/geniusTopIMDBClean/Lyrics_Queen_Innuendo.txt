One two three four
Ooh ooh
While the sun hangs in the sky
And the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea
And meet the land
While theres a wind and the stars
And the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes well keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh well keep on trying yeah
Just passing our time
Ooh ooh
While we live according to race
Color or creed
While we rule by blind madness
And pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition
Superstition false religion
Through the eons and on and on
Oh yes well keep on trying
Well tread that fine line
Oh well keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Through the sorrow
All through our splendor
Dont take offense at my innuendo


You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything
You think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo be free be free
Surrender your ego be free
Be free to yourself
Ooh ooh yeah
If theres a God or any kind
Of justice under the sky
If theres a point if theres a reason
To live or die
If theres an answer to the questions
We feel bound to ask
Show yourself destroy our fears
Release your mask
Oh yes well keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah well keep on smiling yeah
Yeah yeah yeah 
And whatever will be will be
Well just keep on trying 
Well just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
