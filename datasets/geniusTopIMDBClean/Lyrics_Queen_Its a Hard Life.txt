I dont want my freedom
Theres no reason for living
With a broken heart
This is a tricky situation
Ive only got myself to blame
Its just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone
You win you lose
Its a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah I fell in love
But now you say its over
And Im falling apart
Yeah yeah
Its a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever
In each others hearts
Its a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When youre in love
I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say its just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone
How it hurts  Yeah  deep inside  Oh yeah 
When your love has cut
You down to size
Life is tough on your own
Now Im waiting for something
To fall from the skies
Im waiting for love


Yes its a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever
In each others hearts
Its a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When youre in love
Oh oh oh 
Ooh ooh ooh 
Yeah  Its a hard life
In a world thats filled with sorrow
There are people searching
For love in every way
Its a long hard fight  Hard fight 
But Ill always live for tomorrow
Ill look back on myself
And say I did it for love
Yes I did it for love
For love
Oh oh oh I did it for love
