Taking off
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then Id still be where I started bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you Be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive  Yeah  keep yourself alive
Take you all your time anda money honey youll survive
Well Ive loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And Ill grow a little bigger maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then Id still be where I started same as when I started
Keep yourself alive  Come on  keep yourself alive
Take you all your time anda money honey youll survive  shake 
Ow 
Keep yourself alive  whoa  keep yourself alive
Oh take you all your time anda money to keep me satisfied


Do you think youre better every day
No I just think Im two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive  come on  keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive  come on  keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive  come on come on  keep yourself alive
Take you all your time anda money to keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey you will survive
Keep you satisfied keep yourself alive
