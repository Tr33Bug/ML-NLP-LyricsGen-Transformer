She keeps Mot et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A builtin remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy  Ooh ooh 
At anytime an invitation
You cant decline  Ooh ooh 
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
Shes a killer queen
Gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Papapapa  Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah  Ooh ooh 
Killer killer shes a killer queen 
Then again incidentally
If youre that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris  Naturally 
For cars she couldnt care less
Fastidious and precise


Shes a killer queen
Gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Papapapa 
Anytime
Drop of a hat shes as willing as
Playful as a pussycat  Ooh 
Then momentarily out of action  Ooh 
Temporarily out of gas  Tataaa 
To absolutely drive you wild wild
Shes out to get you
Shes a killer queen
Gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam  Papapara 
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try
You wanna try
