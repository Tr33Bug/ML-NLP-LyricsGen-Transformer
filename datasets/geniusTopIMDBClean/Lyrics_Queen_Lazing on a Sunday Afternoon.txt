I go off to work on Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
Ill be back again before its time for sunnydown
Ill be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo
I come from London town
Im just an ordinary guy
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre
Im bound to be proposing on a Saturday night  There he goes again 
Ill be lazing on a Sunday lazing on a Sunday
Lazing on a Sunday afternoon
