Love of my life youve hurt me
Youve broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life cant you see
Bring it back bring it back
Dont take it away from me
Because you dont know
What it means to me
Love of my life dont leave me
Youve taken my love  all my love 
And now desert me
Love of my life cant you see
Please bring it back back  Bring it back bring it back
Dont take it away from me
Because you dont know
What it means to me  means to me 
You will remember when this is blown over
And everythings all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you
How I still love you  I still love you 
Back hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you dont know
What it means to me  means to me 


Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh ooh
