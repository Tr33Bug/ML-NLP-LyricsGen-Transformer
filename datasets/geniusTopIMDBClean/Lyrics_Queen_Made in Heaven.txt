Im taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart
Made in heaven made in heaven
It was all meant to be yeah
Made in heaven made in heaven
Thats what they say
Cant you see
Thats what everybody says to me
Cant you see
Oh I know I know I know that its true
Yes its really meant to be
Deep in my heart
Im having to learn to pay the price
Theyre turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Dont see too many around
Made in heaven made in heaven
Its for all to see
Made in heaven made in heaven
Thats what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really meant to be
Oh cant you see
Yeah everybody everybody says
Yes it was meant to be yeah
When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies
Break through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever yeah
Wish it could last forever forever
Made in heaven
Im playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving in all my soul
Made in heaven made in heaven
It was all meant to be yeah
Made in heaven made in heaven
Thats what everybody says
Wait and see it was really meant to be
So plain to see
Yeah everybody everybody
Everybody tells me so
Yes it was plain to see
Yes it was meant to be
Written in the stars
Written in the stars
Written in the stars
