I dont want to sleep with you
I dont need the passion too
I dont want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life
Is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman
Gives me sweet mother love ah ha
Ive walked too long in this lonely lane
Ive had enough of this same old game
Im a man of the world
And they say that Im strong
But my heart is heavy
And my hope is gone
Out in the city in the cold world outside
I dont want pity
Just a safe place to hide
Mama please let me back inside
I dont want to make no waves
But you can give me
All the love that I crave
I cant take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that youre there
Youre going to give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha  mother love 
My bodys aching but I cant sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
Im coming home to my sweet
Mother love
Mother love mother love
Love love love love 
God works in mysterious ways
Eeeeh dop de dop dep dop
I think Im going back to the things
I learned so well in my youth
