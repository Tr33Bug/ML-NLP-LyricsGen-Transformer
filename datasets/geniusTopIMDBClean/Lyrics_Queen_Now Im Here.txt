Here I stand
Look around around
Around around around
But you wont see me
Now Im here  now Im here 
Now Im there  now Im there 
Im just a just a new man
Yes you made me live again
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared
Didnt understand
But you knew my name on sight
Whatever came of you and me
Americas new bride to be
Ooh dont worry baby
Im safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Dont I love her so
Yeah she made me live again
Yeah
A thin moon me in a smokescreen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Dont move dont speak dont feel no pain
With the rain running down my face
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Dont I love him so
Ooh dont I love him so


Whatever comes of you and me
Id love to leave my memory with you
Now Im here  now Im here 
Think Ill stay around around  think Ill stay around around 
Around around around around  around around around around 
Down in the city just as you and me  down in the city just as you and me 
Dont I love you so
Go go go little queenie
