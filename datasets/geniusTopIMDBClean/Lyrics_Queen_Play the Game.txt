Open up your mind
And let me step inside
Rest your weary head
And let your heart decide
Its so easy when you know the rules
Its so easy all you have
To do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love

When youre feeling down
And your resistance is low
Light another cigarette
And let yourself go
This is your life dont play hard to get
Its a free world all you have
To do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh yeah
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head
Down to my toes
My love is pumping
Through my veins  play the game 
Driving me insane
Come come come come 
Come play the game
Play the game play the game
Play the game


Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
This is your life dont play hard to get
Its a free world  free world 
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game yeah
Everybody play the game of love
Your life dont play hard to get
Its a free world  free world 
All you have to do is fall in love
