Id sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made em laugh you made em cry
You made us feel like we could fly  Radio 
So dont become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just dont know or just dont care
And just complain when youre not there
You had your time you had the power
Youve yet to have your finest hour
Radio  Radio 
All we hear is radio gaga
Radio googoo radio gaga
All we hear is radio gaga
Radio blah blah
Radio whats new
Radio someone still loves you
We watch the shows we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Lets hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time you had the power
Youve yet to have your finest hour
Radio  Radio 
All we hear is radio gaga
Radio googoo radio gaga
All we hear is radio gaga
Radio googoo radio gaga
All we hear is radio gaga
Radio blah blah
Radio whats new
Someone still loves you
Radio gaga radio gaga 
Radio gaga radio gaga 
Radio gaga radio gaga 
You had your time you had the power
Youve yet to have your finest hour
