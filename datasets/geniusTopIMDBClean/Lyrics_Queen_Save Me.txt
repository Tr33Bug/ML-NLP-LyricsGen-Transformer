It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
I love you til I die
Save me save me save me
I cant face this life alone
Save me save me save me
Im naked and Im far from home
The slate will soon be clean
Ill erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted all that love
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart I am cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me save me save me
I cant face this life alone
Save me save me oh
Im naked and Im far from home
Each night I cry
I still believe the lie
I love you til I die  Ow 
Save me save me save me  Oh yeah 
Yeah save me  Yeah 
Save me ooh  Oh save me 
Dont let me face my life alone
Save me save me ooh  Save me 
Im naked and Im far from home
