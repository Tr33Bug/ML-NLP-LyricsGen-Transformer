Fear me you Lords
And lady preachers
I descend upon your earth
From the skies
I command your very souls
You unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Can you hear me you peers
And privy counselors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man
Who dares abuse my trust
I swear that youll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye
Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do and Ill die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever  Ever ever 
Storm the mastermarathon
Ill fly through
By flash and thunderfire
And Ill survive  Ill survive Ill survive 
Then Ill defy the laws of nature  Ill survive Ill survive Ill survive 
And come out alive then Ill get you
Be gone with you
You shod and shady senators
Give out the good
Leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan
And his troubadours
And with a smile
Ill take you to the seven seas of Rhye
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
I do like to stroll upon the Prom Prom Prom
Where the brass band plays tiddelyompompom
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
When Im down beside the sea Im beside meself with glee
Beside the seaside Beside the sea
