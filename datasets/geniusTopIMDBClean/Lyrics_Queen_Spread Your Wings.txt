Sammy was low just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time hed made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
Boy youd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are
You shouldve been sweeping
Up the Emerald Bar
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
Cause you know you should do better
Thats because youre a free man
He spends his evenings
Alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
Hed be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world
Nothing would make him stay
Since he was small had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time hed made up his mind
This could be my last chance
His boss said to him
Now listen boy Youre always dreaming
Youve got no real ambition
You wont get very far
Sammy boy dont you know who you are
Why cant you be happy
At the Emerald Bar
So honey spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
Cause you know you should do better
Thats because youre a free man
Come on honey
Fly with me
