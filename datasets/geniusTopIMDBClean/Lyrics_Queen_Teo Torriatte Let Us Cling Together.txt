Teo Torriatte  Let Us Cling Together  Lyrics
When Im gone
No need to wonder
If I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us
And time is but a paper moon
Be not gone
Though Im gone
Its just as though I hold
The flower that touches you
A new life grows the blossom knows
Theres no one else
Could warm my heart as much as you
Be not gone
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned
Hear my song
Still think of me the way
Youve come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes
And you can be with me
Dream on
When Im gone
Theyll say were all fools
And we dont understand
Oh be strong
Dont turn your heart
Were all youre all
For all for always
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned
