Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why dont you mean it
Why do I follow you
And where do you go
Youve never seen nothing like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it  and the world will so allow it 
Ooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lilypool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile
FieFo the Black Queen marching single file
Take this take that bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen 
Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little niggah sugar
Then a ruba duba baby oil
Black on black on
Every finger nail and toe weve only begun begun
Make this make that keep making all that noise
Oooh march to the Black Queen 
Ooh now Ive got a bellyfull
You can be my sugarbaby
You can be my honeychile yes
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy 
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy 
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
Hell deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life
Hell bring a little love
I reign with my left hand I rule with my right
Im lord of all darkness Im Queen of the night
Ive got the power
Now do the march of the black Queen
My life is in your hands Ill fo and Ill fie
Ill be what you make me Ill do what you like
Ill be a bad boy Ill be your bad boy
Ill do the march of the black Queen
Ah ah ah ah
Walking true to style
Shes vulgar buse and vile
Fiefo the black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes and she never dots her is
Shes our leader 
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you handinhand
But now its time to be gone
La la la la forever  forever
Ah ah ah ah ah
