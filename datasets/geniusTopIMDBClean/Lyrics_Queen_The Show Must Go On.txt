Empty spaces what are we living for
Abandoned places I guess we know the score on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for
Another hero another mindless crime
Behind the curtain in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens Ill leave it all to chance
Another heartache another failed romance on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for
I guess Im learning
I must be warmer now
Ill soon be turning round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark Im aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday grow but never die
I can fly my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
Ill face it with a grin
Im never giving in
On with the show
Ill top the bill
Ill overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on
