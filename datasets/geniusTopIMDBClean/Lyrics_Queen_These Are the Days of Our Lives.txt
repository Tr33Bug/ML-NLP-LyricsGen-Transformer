Sometimes I get to feeling
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids
When we were young
Things seemed so perfect you know
The days were endless
We were crazy we were young
The sun was always shining
We just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just dont know
The rest of my lifes been just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone
Now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You cant turn back the clock
You cant turn back the tide
Aint that a shame
Ooh Id like to go back one time
On a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinking
On what you did
When you can lay back
And enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just dont know
Better sit back and go with the flow
Cause these are the days of our lives
Theyve flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone
Now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change
Those were the days of our lives yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone
Now but one things still true
When I look and I find I still love you
I still love you
