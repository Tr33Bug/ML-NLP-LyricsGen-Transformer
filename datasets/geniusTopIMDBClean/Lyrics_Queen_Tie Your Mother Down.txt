Get your heart beating baby

Lock your daddy out of doors

Youre such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house
Thats all I ever get from your
Your family ties in fact
I dont think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I dont give a light
Im gonna make out all right
Ive got a sweetheart in hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin and grousin goin on all night
Tie your mother down

Take your little brother
Swimming with a brick thats alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you aint no friend of mine
Bad guy

Are gonna plague me till I die
They cant understand it
Im just a peace loving guy
Tie your mother down

Get that big big big big big
Big daddy out the door

All your love tonight
Give me every inch of your love
Gotta get my timing right
All your love tonight yeah
