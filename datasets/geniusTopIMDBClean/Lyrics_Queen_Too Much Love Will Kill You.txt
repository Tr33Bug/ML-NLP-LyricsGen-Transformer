Im just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
Im far away from home and Ive been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind Ive been looking back to find
Where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you cant make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
Youre headed for disaster
Cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time
Im just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like theres no way out of this for me
No theres no making sense of it
Every way I go Im bound to lose
Oh yes
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It will drain the power thats in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
Youre the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time
Yes too much love will kill you
It will make your life a lie
Yes too much love will kill you
And you wont understand why
Youd give your life youd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end
In the end
