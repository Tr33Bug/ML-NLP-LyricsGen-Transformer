Ive paid my dues time after time
Ive done my sentence but committed no crime
And bad mistakes Ive made a few
Ive had my share of sand kicked in my face but Ive come through
And I need to go on and on and on and on 
We are the champions my friends
And well keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions of the world
Ive taken my bows and my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But its been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I aint gonna lose
And I need to go on and on and on and on 
We are the champions my friends
And well keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions of the world
We are the champions my friends
And well keep on fighting till the end oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
Cause we are the champions
