Theres no time for us
Theres no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever Ooh
Theres no chance for us
Its all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Oh when love must die
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway
