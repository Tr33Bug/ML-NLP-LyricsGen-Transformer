Were on thats a nice way to start Jonny
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights
Ill stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five
Ill lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five
Its the devils way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention


I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
Cause Im not cause Im not
I swat em like flies
But like flies the bugs keep coming back
Not but Im not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But Im not but Im not
But Im not but Im not
Dont question my authority or put me in a box
Cause Im not cause Im not
Oh go and tell the king
That the sky is falling in
But its not but its not but its not
Maybe not maybe not
