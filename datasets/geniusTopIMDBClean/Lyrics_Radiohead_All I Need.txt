Im the next act
Waiting in the wings
Im an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore
You are all I need
Youre all I need
Im in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
Im just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Cause there are no others
You are all I need
Youre all I need
Im in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
Its all wrong its all wrong its all wrong
Its all right  its all right  its all right
Its all wrong  its all right
Its all right  its all right
