I do not understand
What it is Ive done wrong
Full of holes check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes two for no
Ive no idea what I am talking about
Im trapped in this body and cant get out
You killed the sound removed backbone
A pale imitation with the edges all sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someones hand up your arse
Has the light gone out for you
Because the lights gone out for me
It is the twentyfirst century
It is the twentyfirst century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped round my face
All the lines wrapped round my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
Im a lie
Ive seen it coming
Theyve seen it coming
Theyve seen it coming
Theyve seen it coming
