Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a roundup
This is a lowflying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a lowflying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
