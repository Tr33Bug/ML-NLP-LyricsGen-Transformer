I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
Youll only see my reflection
Its always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know were friends til we die
And either way you turn Ill be there
Open up your skull Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
Its always best when the light is off
Its always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
Ive got the smell of a local man
Whos got the loneliest feeling
That either way he turns I will be there
Open up your skull Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
