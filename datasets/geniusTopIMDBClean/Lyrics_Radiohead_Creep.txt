TranslationsDeutschEspaol
When you were here before
Couldnt look you in the eye
Youre just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
Youre so fuckin special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I dont belong here
I dont care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When Im not around
Youre so fuckin special
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I dont belong here
Oh oh
Shes running out the door
Shes running out
She run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
Youre so fuckin special
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I dont belong here
I dont belong here
