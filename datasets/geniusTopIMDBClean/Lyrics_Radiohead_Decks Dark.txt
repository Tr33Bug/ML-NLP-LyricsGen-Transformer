Then into your life there comes a darkness
Theres a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And theres nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But its the loudest sound youve ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour
But it was just a laugh just a laugh just a laugh just a laugh
Even at this angle and so we crumble
A ten ton head made of wet sand oh this dread circumference
Youve gotta be kidding me the grass grows over me
Your face in the glass in the glass it was just a laugh just a laugh
Its whatever you say it is in split infinity
Then into your life there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And theres nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But its the loudest sound youve ever heard
Into your darkest hour
When youve had enough of me
When youve had enough of me
Sweet darling
When youve had enough of me
When youve had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet times
