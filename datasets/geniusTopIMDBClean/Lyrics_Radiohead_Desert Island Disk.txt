Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light born of a light
The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit wide
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection
In a window switching on a light
One I didnt know totally alive totally released
Waking waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah you you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
You you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
