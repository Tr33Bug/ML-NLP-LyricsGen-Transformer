TranslationsTrkeExit Music  For A Film  Lyrics
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape we escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
Breathe keep breathing
Dont lose your nerve
Breathe keep breathing
I cant do this alone
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
Theres such a chill
Such a chill
And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke that you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
