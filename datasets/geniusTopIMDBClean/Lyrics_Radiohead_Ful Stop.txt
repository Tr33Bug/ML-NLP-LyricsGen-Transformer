You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up the tinderbox
Why should I be good if youre not
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up  All the good times 
When you take me back
Take me back again
Will you take me back
Take me back again
You really messed up

You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
