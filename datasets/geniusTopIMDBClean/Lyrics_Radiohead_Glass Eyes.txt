Hey its me I just got off the train
A frightening place the faces are concrete grey
And Im wondering should I turn around
Buy another ticket The panic is coming on strong
So cold from the inside out
No great drama message coming in
In the ohsosmug glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush I dont know where it leads
And I dont really care
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush I dont know where it leads
And I dont really care
I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn cold
