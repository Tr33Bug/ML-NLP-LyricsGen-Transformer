Two jumps in a week I bet you
Think thats pretty clever dont you boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
Youd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
Youre turning into something you are not
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
Theyre the ones wholl hate you
When you think youve got the world all sussed out
Theyre the ones wholl spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Oh its the best thing that youve ever had
The best thing that youve ever ever had
Its the best thing that youve ever had
The best thing youve had has gone away
So dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
