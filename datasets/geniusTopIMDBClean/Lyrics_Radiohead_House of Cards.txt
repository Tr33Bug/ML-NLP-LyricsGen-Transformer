I dont wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards
And Ill do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And Ill do mine
And fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial denial
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband goodnight
And forget about your house of cards
And Ill do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And Ill do mine
Fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial denial
Denial denial
Your ears should be burning 
Denial denial
Your ears should be burning
