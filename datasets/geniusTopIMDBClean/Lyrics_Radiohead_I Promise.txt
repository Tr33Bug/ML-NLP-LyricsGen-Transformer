I wont run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when you lock me out
I promise
Ill say my prayers every night
I promise
I know which side Im spread
I promise
The tantrums and the chitty chats
I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotten deck
I promise
I wont run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotten deck
I promise
I wont run away no more
I promise
