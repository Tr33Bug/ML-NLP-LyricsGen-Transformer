A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes wont let me in
And now I know its never gonna be
Oh me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes wont let me in
And now I know its never gonna be
Oh me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes wont let me in
And now I know its never gonna be
Oh me
The sweetfaced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love that we all can love that we all
The sweetfaced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love that we all can love that we all
But now I see you messing me around
I dont want to know I dont want to know I dont want
When I see you messing me around
I dont want to know I dont want to know I dont want to know
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create that we can create that we can
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create that we can create
But when I see you messing me around
I dont want to know I dont want to know I dont want
When I see you messing me around
I dont want to know I dont want to know I dont want to know
