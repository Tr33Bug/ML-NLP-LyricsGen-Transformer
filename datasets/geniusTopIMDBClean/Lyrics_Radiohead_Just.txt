Cant get the stink off
Hes been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day hell get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself you do
And thats why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Dont get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
Youve changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day Ill get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself you do
And thats why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself you do
And thats why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self
You do it to yourself 
You do it to yourself 
Oh you do it to yourself 
Oh you do it to yourself
