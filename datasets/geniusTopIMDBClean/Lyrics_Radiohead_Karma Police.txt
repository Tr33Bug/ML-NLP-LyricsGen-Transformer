Karma police arrest this man
He talks in maths he buzzes like a fridge
Hes like a detuned radio
Karma police arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
Karma police Ive given all I can
Its not enough Ive given all I can
But were still on the payroll
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
Phew for a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
Phew for a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
