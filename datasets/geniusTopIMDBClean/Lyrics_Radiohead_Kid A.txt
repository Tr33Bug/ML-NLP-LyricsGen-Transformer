TranslationsTrke
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie
Weve got heads on sticks
And youve got ventriloquists
Weve got heads on sticks
And youve got ventriloquists
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on kids
