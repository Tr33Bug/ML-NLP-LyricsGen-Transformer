Im on a roll
Im on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me Sarah
Kill me again with love
Its gonna be a glorious day
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause Im your superhero
We are standing on the edge
The head of state
Has called for me by name
But I dont have time for him
Its gonna be
A glorious day
I feel my luck could change
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
Cause Im your superhero
We are standing on the edge
We are standing on the edge
