Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think youre crazy
Maybe I think youre crazy
Maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
Its not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think youre crazy
Maybe I think youre crazy
Maybe
I will see you in the next life
