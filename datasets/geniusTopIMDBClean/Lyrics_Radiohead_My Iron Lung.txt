Faith youre driving me away
You do it every day
You dont mean it but it hurts like hell
My brain says Im receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support my iron lung
Were too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it cant you tell
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung
The headshrinkers they want my everything
My uncle Bill my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers they want my everything
My uncle Bill my Belisha beacon
Suck suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out well just hum
This this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time my iron lung
The headshrinkers they want my everything
My uncle Bill my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers they want my everything
My uncle Bill my Belisha beacon
And if youre frightened you can be frightened
You can be its okay
And if youre frightened you can be frightened
You can be its okay
The headshrinkers they want my everything
My uncle Bill my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers they want my everything
My uncle Bill my Belisha beacon
