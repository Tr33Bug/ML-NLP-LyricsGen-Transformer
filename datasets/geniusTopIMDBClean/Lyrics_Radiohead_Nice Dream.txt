Nice Dream  Lyrics
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine made me happy
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend the good angel
But shes out with her answerphone
She said that shed love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream  If you think that youre strong enough 
Nice dream  If you think you belong enough 
Nice dream  If you think that youre strong enough 
Nice dream  If you think you belong enough 
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
