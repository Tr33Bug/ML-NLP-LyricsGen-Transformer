A heart thats full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that wont heal
You look so tired unhappy
Bring down the government
They dont they dont speak for us
Ill take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
Get me out of here 
No alarms and no surprises
Get me out of here 
No alarms and no surprises please
Get me out of here
