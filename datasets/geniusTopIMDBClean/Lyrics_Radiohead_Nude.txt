Dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But therell be something missing
Now that youve found it its gone
Now that you feel it you dont
Youve gone off the rails
So dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
Youll go to hell for what your
Dirty mind is thinking
