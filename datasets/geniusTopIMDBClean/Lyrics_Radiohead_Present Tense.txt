This dance this dance
Is like a weapon is like a weapon
Of selfdefence of selfdefence
Against the present against the present
The present tense
No I wont get heavy dont get heavy
Keep it light and keep it moving
I am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down
Ill be dancing freaking out
Deaf dumb and blind
In you Im lost
In you Im lost
I wont turn around or the penny drops
Wont stop now wont slack off
Or all this love will be in vain
To stop from falling down a mine
Its no ones business but mine
Where all this love has been in vain
In you Im lost
In you Im lost
In you Im lost
In you Im lost
