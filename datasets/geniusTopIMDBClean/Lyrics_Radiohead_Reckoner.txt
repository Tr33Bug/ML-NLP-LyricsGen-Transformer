Reckoner
Cant take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all hu
All human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate  In rainbows 
Like ripples on a blank shore  In rainbows 
Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all hu
All human beings
