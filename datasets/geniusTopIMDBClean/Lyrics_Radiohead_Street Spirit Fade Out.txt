Street Spirit  Fade Out  Lyrics
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things well one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out
This machine will will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again
And fade out again
Ahnana ahnana
Ahnana ahnana
Ahnana ahnana
Ahnana ahnana
Cracked eggs dead birds scream as they fight for life
I can feel death can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things well one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out again
Ahnana ahnana
Ahnana ahnana
Ahnana ahnana
Ahnana ahnana
Immerse your soul in love  Ahnana ahnana 
Ahnana ahnana 
Immerse your soul in love  Ahnana ahnana
