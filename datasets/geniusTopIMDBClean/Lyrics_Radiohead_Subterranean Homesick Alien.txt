The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you cant smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets
Theyre all uptight uptight
Uptight uptight
Uptight uptight
I wish that theyd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when Im driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as Id love to see it
Id tell all my friends but theyd never believe me
Theyd think that Id finally lost it completely
Id show them the stars and the meaning of life
Theyd shut me away
But Id be alright alright
Mom Im alright alright
Im just uptight uptight
Uptight uptight
Uptight uptight
Uptight uptight
Uptight
