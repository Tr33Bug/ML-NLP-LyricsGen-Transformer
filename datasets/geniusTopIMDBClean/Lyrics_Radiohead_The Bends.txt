Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My bloodll thicken
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
Cause Id be scared that theres nothing underneath
And who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends
Am I really sinking this low
My babys got the bends oh no
We dont have any real friends
No no no
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the 60s I wish we could be happy
I wish I wish I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away to blow me sky high
My babys got the bends
We dont have any real friends
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the 60s I wish we could be happy
I wish I wish I wish that something would


I wanna live breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race race race race
Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you
