It holds us like a phantom
It touches  like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
Cause were not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mmhmm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
Its not somewhere else
Its not somewhere else
Its not somewhere else
One day at a time 
One day at a time
We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers dont decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like were pretty broken flowers
Well take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a time
