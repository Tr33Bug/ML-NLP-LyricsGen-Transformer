It barks at no one else but me
Like its seen a ghost
I guess its seen the sparks aflowin
No one else would know
Hey man slow down slow down
Idiot slow down slow down
Sometimes I get overcharged
Thats when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell Im going
At a thousand feet per second
Hey man slow down slow down
Idiot slow down slow down
Hey man slow down slow down
Idiot slow down slow down
