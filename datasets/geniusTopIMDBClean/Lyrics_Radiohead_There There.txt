In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
Theres always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
Dont reach out dont reach out 
Dont reach out dont reach out 
Steer away from these rocks
Wed be a walking disaster
Dont reach out dont reach out 
Dont reach out dont reach out 
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
Someone on your shoulder 
Someone on your shoulder 
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
Someone on your shoulder 
Someone on your shoulder 
There there
Why so greedy and lonely and lonely
And lonely
Heaven sent you to me to me
To me


We are accidents waiting waiting
To happen
We are accidents waiting waiting
To happen
