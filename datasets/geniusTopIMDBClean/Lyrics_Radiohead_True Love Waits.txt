Ill drown my beliefs
To have your babies
Ill dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just dont leave
Dont leave
Im not living
Im just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just dont leave
Dont leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just dont leave
Dont leave
