In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here
Why should I stay
Id be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms  Way out 
I follow to the edge  Way out 
Of the earth  Way out 
And fall off
Yeah everybody leaves  Way out 
If they get the chance  Way out 
And this  Way out 
Is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Yeah I
Ill hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I
Ill hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
