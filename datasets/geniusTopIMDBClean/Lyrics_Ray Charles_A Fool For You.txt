I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you didnt want me
You didnt love me no more
I want to know
Oh what makes me be
Do you believe me child
A fool for you
Oh no Im a fool for you
I know you told me
You didnt want me around
And I know
You got a man way across town
So I know its something
Did you ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Reach over and feel the pillow
Where your baby used to lay
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before oh Lord
Yeah you even cry so loud
You give the blues to your neighbor next door
Ever since you were five years old
I been a fool for you little girl
Way down in my soul
Im a little fool for you
So I know its something
Oh oh Lord
Im a fool for you
