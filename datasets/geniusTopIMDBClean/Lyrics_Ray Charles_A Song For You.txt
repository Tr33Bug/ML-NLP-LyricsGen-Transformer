Ive been so many places in my life and time
Ive sung a lot of songs Ive made some bad rhymes
Ive acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching
But were alone now and Im singing this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be baby
Ive treated you unkindly but girl cant you see
Theres no one more important to me
So darling cant you please see through me
Because were alone now and Im singing my song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
But you came out in front and I was hiding yeah
But now Im so much better so if my words dont come together
Listen to the melody cause my loves in there hiding
I love you in a place where theres no space or time
I love you for my life because youre a friend of mine
And when my life is over remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you
I love you in a place where theres no space or time
I love you for my life yes youre a friend of mine
And when my life is over remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you
Yes we were alone and I was singing this song for you baby
We were alone and I was singing my song
Singing my song
Singing my song
Singing my song
Singing my song
