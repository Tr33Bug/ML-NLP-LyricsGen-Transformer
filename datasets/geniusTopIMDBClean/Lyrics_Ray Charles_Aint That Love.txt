Now baby when you sigh
When you sigh 
I want to sigh with you
When you cry
When you cry 
I want to cry some too
Now aint that love
Aint that love 
Oh aint that love that I feel
That I feel 
In my heart for you
When your friends
When your friends 
Turn their back on you
Ill be here
Ill be here 
Just to see you through
Now when you walk
When you walk 
I want to walk with you
When you talk
When you talk 
Want to talk some too
If you ever
If you ever 
Ever need a friend
Ill be with you
Be with you 
Yes until the end
Baby wont you let me hold your hand
I want to squeeze you as tight as I can
Baby dont you need me by your side
To protect you and be your guide
Baby Im so in love with you
Id do anything you tell me to
Oh that I feel in my heart for you
Oh
