Am I blue Am I blue
Aint these tears in these eyes telling you
Am I blue Youll be too
If your schemes like your dreams done fell through
Was a time I was her only one
Now I am the sad and lonely one
Oh yes I am
Was I gay Till today
Now shes gone and were through
Am I blue
Was a time I was her only one
Now I am the sad and lonely one
Im such a lonely one
Was I gay Till today
Now shes gone and were through
Am I blue
