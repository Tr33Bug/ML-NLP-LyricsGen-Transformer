Oh beautiful for heroes proved
In liberating strife
Who more than self our country loved
And mercy more than life
America America may God thy gold refine
Til all success be nobleness
And every gain devined
And you know when I was in school
We used to sing it something like this listen here
Oh beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain
But now wait a minute Im talking about
America sweet America
You know God done shed his grace on thee
He crowned thy good yes he did in a brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
You know I wish I had somebody to help me sing this
America America 
America I love you America you see
God shed his grace on thee 
My God He done shed his grace on thee
And you oughta love Him for it
Because He He He He crowned thy good
He told me He would with a brotherhood
From sea to shining sea 
Oh Lord oh Lord I thank you Lord
Shining sea
