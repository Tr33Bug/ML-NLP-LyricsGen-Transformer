Born to lose Ive lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life Ive always been so blue
Born to lose and now Im losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that youre not there
Youve grown tired and now you say were through
Born to lose and now Im losing you
Born to lose Ive lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life Ive always been so blue
Born to lose and now Im losing you
Born to lose and now Im losing you
Im losing you
