Yeah my bills are all due and the baby needs shoes but Im busted
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound but Im busted right now
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that wont lay
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day
The countys gonna haul my belongings away cause Im busted right now
Oh yes I am
Well I went to my brother to ask for a loan cause I was busted
I hate to beg like a dog without a bone but Im busted I tell ya
My brother said There aint a thing I can do
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
And I was just thinking about calling on you cause Im busted myself
Well thats what he told me
Yeah I am no thief but a man can go wrong when hes busted
The food that we canned the last summer is gone and Im busted right now
Well the fields all are bare and the cotton wont grow
Me and my family got to pack up and go
Ill make a living where I dont know cause Im busted today
Yall know Im broke
I aint got no money
Im talkin bout empty pockets
Ah forget it
Ah to hell with it
