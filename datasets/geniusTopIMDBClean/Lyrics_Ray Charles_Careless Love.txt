Well I say love oh love careless love
I say love oh love oh careless love woah
Love please tell me what have I done
For you to hurt me all in fun
Well you know that I once was blind but now I see
I say that I once was blind but now I see
Well you know I once was blind but Im so glad so glad I see
That that old love has made a fool of me
Well you know what a big fool I have been
Let me say what a big fool I have been
Let me say what what a big fool that I have been
But Id be Id be one all over again
Well you know if I could mhm like a morning dove
Well if I could mhm like a morning dove
Well if I could moan if I could moan uh like a morning dove
You know Id moan for everyone in love
Thats why I said love oh oh oh love careless love
Woah I said love oh oh love careless love
