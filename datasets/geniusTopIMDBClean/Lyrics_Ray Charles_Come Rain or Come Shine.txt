Im gonna love you like no ones loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But dont ever bet me
Cause Im gonna be true well if you let me
Youre gonna love me like nobodys loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together unhappy together
And wouldnt it be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
Were in or are we out of the money
Yeah but Im with you always
Im with you rain or shine
Youre gonna love me like nobodys loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together unhappy together
And wouldnt it be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
Were in or are we out of the money
Yeah but Im with you always
Im with you rain or shine
