Oh its cryin time again
Youre gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling oh
That it wont be long before its cryin time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder  Fonder 
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger  Stronger 
If I lived to be a hundred years old
Oh its cryin time again
Youre gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling yeah now
That it wont be long before its crying time
Now you say youve found someone that you love better  Better 
Thats the way its happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow  Morrow 
Cryin time will start when you walk out the door
Oh its cryin time again
Youre gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling oh right now
That it wont be long before its cryin time
That it wont be long before its cryin time
