It brings a tear into my eyes
When I begin to realize
Ive cried so much since youve been gone
I guess Im drowning in my own tears
I sit and cry just like a child
My pouring tears are running wild
If you dont think youll be home soon
I guess Ill drown oh yeah in my own tears
I know its true into each life
Oh some rain rain must pour
Im so blue here without you
It keeps raining more and more
Why dont you come on home
Oh yes so I wont be all alone
If you dont think youll be home soon
I guess Ill  drown in my own tears 
Ooh dont let me
Drown in my own tears 
When Im in trouble baby
Drown in my own tears 
Oh yeah baby dont let me
Drown in my own tears 
I guess Ill drown in my own tears
Oh mmmmm
