There were times I left your heart in pain
Time again Ive turned and walked away
I get to where Im going just to find
Wont be happy in this world
If youre not by my side
Ellie my love so sweet
My heart told me to break away
Now Im out here far away
Wish that I could hold you in the night
Then Id wake up to a morning
That is warm and bright
Oh Ellie my love so sweet
Smile for me wont you baby
Forever youll be on my mind
Drink with me wont you baby
Were gonna make it right this time
Theres no one else like you
Anything you want Ill do
Ellie my love so sweet
Well Ellie my love so sweet
My heart told me to break away
Now Im here so far away
Wish that I could hold you in the night  So tight 
Then Id wake up to a morning
That is warm and bright
Ellie my love so sweet
Smile for me wont you baby
Forever youll be on my mind
Drink with me wont you baby
Were gonna make it right this time
Theres no one else like you
Anything you want Ill do
Ellie my love so sweet
Oh Ellie my love so sweet
Smile for me wont you baby
Forever youll be on my mind
Drink with me wont you baby
Were gonna make it right this time
Theres no one else like you
Anything you want Ill do
Ellie my love so sweet
Oh Ellie my love so sweet
Yes Ellie my love oh so sweet yes
