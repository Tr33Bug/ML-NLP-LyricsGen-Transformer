Georgia
Georgia
The whole day through
The whole day through 
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind 
I said aGeorgia
Georgia
A song of you
A song of you 
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms areach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in the peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
I said Georgia oh Georgia
No peace I find  No peace I find 
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind oh 
Other arms areach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
Oh oh
Georgia
Georgia
No peace no peace I find
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Georgia on my mind 


I said just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
