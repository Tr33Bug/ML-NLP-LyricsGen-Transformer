Hard Times  No One Knows Better Than I  Lyrics
My mother told me before she passed away
Said Son when Im gone dont forget to pray
Because therell be hard times hard times oh yeah yeah
Who knows better than I
Well I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay my rent
Talking about hard times hard times oh yeah yeah
Who knows oh well better than I
I had a woman Lord who was always around
But when I lost my money then she put me down
Talking about hard times you know those hard
Yeah Lord who knows better than I
Yeah Lord yeah one of these days
Therell be no more sorrow when I pass away
And no more hard times I say No more hard
Yeah Lord who knows yeah Lord better than I
