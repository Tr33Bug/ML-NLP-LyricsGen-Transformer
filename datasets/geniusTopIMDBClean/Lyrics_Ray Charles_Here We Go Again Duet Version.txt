Here We Go Again  Duet Version  Lyrics
Here we go again
Hes back in town again
Ill take him back again
One more time
Here we go again
The phone will ring again
Ill be her fool again  I will 
One more time
Ive been there before
And I will try it again
But any fool any fool knows
That theres no no way to win
Here we go again
Shell break my heart again
Ill play the part again
One more time
Alright Mr Preston 
Ive been there before  and you know what 
I will try it again
But any fool any fool knows
That theres no no way to win
Here we go again
ShellHell break my heart again
Ill play the part again
One more time
Ill take herhim back again
One more time
I will
