One of these days and it wont be long
Youre going to look for me and Ill be gone
Now you know I believe
I believe yes I believe 
I say I believe right now
I believe yes I believe 
Well I believe to my soul now
Youre trying to make a fool of me
I believe it I believe it 
Well youre going around here with your head so hard
I think Im gonna have to use my rod
Cause I believe
I believe yes I believe 
I say I believe right now
I believe yes I believe 
Well I believe to my soul now
Youre trying to make a fool of me now
I believe it I believe it 
Last night you were dreaming and I heard you say
Oh Johnny  When you know my name is Ray
Thats why I believe it now
I believe yes I believe 
I say I believe right now
I believe yes I believe 
Whoaoh I believe to my soul now
Youre trying to make a fool of me now
I believe it
