I cant stop loving you Ive made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
I cant stop wanting you its useless to say
So Ill just live my life in dreams of yesterdays dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since weve been apart yeah
I cant stop loving you Ive made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
I cant stop wanting you its useless to say
So Ill just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
Those happy hours  Those happy hours 
That we once knew  That we once knew 
Though long ago  Though long ago 
Still make me blue  Still make me blue 
They say that time  They say that time 
Heals a broken heart  Heals a broken heart 
But time has stood still  Time has stood still 
Since weve been apart  Since weve been apart 
I cant stop loving you I said Ive made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times sing the song to me
I cant stop wanting you its useless to say
So Ill just live my life of dreams of yesterdays of yesterdays
