I dont need no doctor
Cause I know whats ailing me
I dont need no doctor no no
Cause I know whats ailing me
Ive been too long away from my baby ah
Im coming down with a misery
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor I tell you now
For my prescription to be filled
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
Only my babys arms
Could ever take away this chill
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
Now the doctor say I need rest  Hey hey 
Before I need her tenderness
Put me on the critical list  Hey hey 
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didnt soothe  It didnt soothe 
My emotion


I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor no no
For my hope to live is gone
I dont need no doctor
I dont need no doctor
All I need is my baby
