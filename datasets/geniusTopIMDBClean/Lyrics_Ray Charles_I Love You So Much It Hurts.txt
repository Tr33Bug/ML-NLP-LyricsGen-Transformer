Oh I love you so much it hurts me
Darling thats why Im so blue  Im so blue 
Im so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you  Losing you 
You know I love you so  Love you so  much  Much too much 
It hurts me  Ooh ooh ooh ooh 
And theres nothing I can do  I can do 
I want to hold you my dear forever and ever
Cause I love you so much it hurts me so
I love you so much it hurts me
And thats why Im so blue
Im so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you
I love you so much it hurts me
And theres nothing I can do  I can do 
I want to hold you my dear forever and ever
I love you so much  So much  oh it hurts me  So much 
It hurts me so
Hurts me so
