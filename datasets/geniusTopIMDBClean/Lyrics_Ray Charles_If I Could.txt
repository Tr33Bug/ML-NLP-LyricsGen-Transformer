If I could
Id protect you from the sadness in your eyes
Give you courage in a world of compromise
Yes I would
If I could
I would teach you all the things Ive never learned
And Id help you cross the bridges that Ive burned
Yes I would
If I could
I would try to shield your innocence from time
But the part of life I gave you isnt mine
Ive watched you grow so I could let you go
If I could
I would help you make it through the hungry years
But I know that I could never dry your tears
But I would If I could
Yes If I live
In a time and place where you dont wanna be
You dont have to walk along this road with me
My yesterday wont have to be your way
If I knew
I would try to change the world I brought you to
And there isnt very much that I could do
But I would If I could
Oh baby
Daddy wants to protect you
And help my baby through the hungriest
Because youre part of me
And if you ever ever need
Said a shoulder to cry on
Or just someone to talk to
Ill be there Ill be there
I didnt change the world
But I would if I could
Oh darling I love you baby
