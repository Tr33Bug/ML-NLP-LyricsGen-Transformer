In the heat of the night
Seems like a cold sweat
Creeping cross my brow oh yes
In the heat of the night
Im feeling motherless somehow
Stars with evil eyes stare from the skies
All mean and bright
In the heat of the night
Aint a woman here before
Knows how to make the morning come
So hard to keep control
Well I could sell my soul for just a little light
In the heat of the night
Ive got trouble wall to wall
Oh yes I have
I repeat in the night
Must be an ending to us all
Oh Lord it wont be long
Yes just you be strong
And itll be all right
In the heat of the night
In the heat of the night
