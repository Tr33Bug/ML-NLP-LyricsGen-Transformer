When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right there in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
Seems like I can still hear her say
Let it be let it be let it be let it be
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
And when the brokenhearted
People living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
Yall help me sing the thing now
Let it be  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
Let it be  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
There will be an answer let it be
Let me repeat that
Let it be  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
Oh Lord  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow let it be
You know Ill wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary she comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
Seems like I heard her say son


Let it be  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
Let it be  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
There will be an answer let it be
All you got to do is keep the faith and
Let it be  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
Oh oh  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
There will be an answer let it be
Oh let it be  Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
Let it be  let it be  Let it be 
Whisper words of wisdom let it be
