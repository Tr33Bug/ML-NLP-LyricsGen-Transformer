Hey everybody
Lets have some fun
You only live but once
And when youre dead youre done
So let the good times roll
I said let the good times roll
I dont care if youre young or old
You ought to get together and let the good times roll
Dont sit there mumbling
Talking trash
If you want to have a ball
You got to go out and spend some cash
And let the good times roll now
Im talking about the good times
Well it makes no difference whether youre young or old
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll
Hey yall tell everybody Ray Charles in town
I got a dollar and a quarter and Im just ringing the clock
But dont let no female play me cheap
I got fifty cents more than Im gonna keep
So let the good times roll now
I tell yall Im gonna let the good times roll now
Well it dont make no difference if youre young or old
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll


Hey no matter whether rainy weather
If you want to have a ball you got to get yourself together
Oh get yourself under control woah and let the good times roll
Yeah
