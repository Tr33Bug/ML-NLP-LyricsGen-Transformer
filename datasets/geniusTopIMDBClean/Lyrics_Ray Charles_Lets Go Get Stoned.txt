Lets go get stoned oh oh oh  Everybody
Lets go get stoned  Now wait a minute
You know my baby she wont let me in

And then Im gonna call my buddy on the telephone and say
Lets go get stoned  Now listen

Everything I try to do seem to always turn out wrong
Thats why I wanna stop by on my way home and say
Lets go get stoned  Now let me tell you one more thing
Aint no harm to have a little a taste
But dont lose your cool and start messing up the mans place
Aint no harm take a little nip
But dont you fall down and bust your lip no no

Lets go get stoned oh oh oh  Now now
Lets go get stoned  I think you ought to say it one more time
Lets go get stoned
