I got something in my bones
Make me wanna shout Hallelujah
And when I sing it sing on
I sing on
Woo Lord help me
Lift every voice and sing til earth and Heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of liberty
Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea
Come on yall
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us
Hey facing the rising sun oh of the new day begun
And let us march on til the victorys won
God of our weary years God of our silent tears
Thou Who hast brought us thus far along the way
Thou Who hast by Thy might led us into the light
And keep us forever oh in the path we pray
One more time yall
Lest our feet stray from the places our God where we met Thee
My Lord my God
Lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world we forget Thee
Help me oh
Shadowed beneath Thy hand may we forever stand
True to our God and true to our native land
Facing the rising sun of the new day begun
And let us march on til our victory is won
Amen Amen
