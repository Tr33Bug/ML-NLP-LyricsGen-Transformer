Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know its always dark and dreary
Since I broke off baby with you
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldnt say I do
Well I feel so sad and blue
And its all because of you
I could cry I could cry I could cry
I could die I could die I could die 
Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Lonely avenue  Yes sir
Now my covers they feel like lead
And my pillow it feels like stone
Well Ive tossed and turned so every night
Im not used to being alone
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldnt say I do
Well I feel so sad and blue
You know its all because of you
I could cry I could cry I could cry
I could die I could die I could die 
Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Yes sir  lonely avenue 
Lonely avenue
Lonely avenue
Now Ive been so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child I would be highway bound
I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldnt say I do
Well I feel so sad and blue
You know its all because of you
I could cry I could cry I could cry
I could die I could die I could die  Oh ooh yeah
I live on a lonely avenue
Lonely avenue
