Another bride another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season another reason
To make whoopee
A lot of shoes a lot of rice
The groom is nervous uhh he answers twice
Its really killing the boys so willing
To make whoopee whoopee
Picture a little love nest yeah
Down where the roses cling
Picture that same sweet love nest
See what a year can bring
I tell you the boys washing dishes and baby clothes
Hes so ambitious ooh I tell you he sews
Its really killing the boys so willing
To make whoopee whoopee
Another year maybe less
Whats this I hear well cant you guess
She feels neglected and hes suspected
Of making Whoopee
She sits alone most every night
He doesnt phone he doesnt write
He says hes busy and she says is he
Hes making whoopee
You see I dont make much money
Only five uhuh thousand per
And some judge who thinks hes funny
Tells me I got to pay six to her
I said now judge suppose I fail
The judge says ray son son right on into jail
Ah you better keep her I think its cheaper
You know what Ive been doing dont you
