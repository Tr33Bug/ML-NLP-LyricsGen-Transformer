And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesnt matter how old that i grow
Mothers love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mothers love away
Mama could be strong but you knew that she loved you
She taught me how to walk and talk and pray
Since shes gone on a heaven
All those memories of those days
And i think of the things that i didnt get a chance to say
And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesnt matter how old that i grow
Mothers love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mothers love away
Always there the first thing the morning
Making sure that i got up for school
Get yourself ready to go
She said go to class and learn some more
And remember that theres no one in the word better than you
Thats why i miss my mother


There aint no blues that have been written
That could make me feel this way
I lost the one that was there for me all my life
The day the Lord took mama far away
