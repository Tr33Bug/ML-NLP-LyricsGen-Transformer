Theres a rumour going around
That some of you good people
Want to leave this town
But you better consult me before you go
Cause Ive been in all these places
And I know
Chicagos all right
Its got the Wrigley Field and
Soldiers Field and Marshall Field
And its on a nice lake
But it hasnt got
The hansoms in the park
It hasnt got a skyline after dark
Thats why New Yorks my home
Never let me leave it
New Yorks my home sweet home
What about Hollywood
Hollywoods got movie stars and
Movie czars and cocktail bars and
Shiny cars and a wonderful climate they say
But it hasnt got
The handy subway train
You seldom find a taxi
When it rains
Thats why New Yorks my home
Keep your California
New Yorks my home sweet home
Geez whats happening in StLouis
Lots of people like StLouis
Its got lots of shoes
And the StLouis blues and
One of our larger rivers runs by


But it hasnt got the opera in The Met
It hasnt got a famous string quartet
Thats why New Yorks my home
No not a place to visit
New Yorks my home sweet home
San Francisco 
Is a lovely place
Its got lots of hills
And lots of thrills and its
On an ocean of some size
But it hasnt got
The Bowery or The Bronx
It hasnt got the Harlem honkytonks
Thats why New Yorks my home
Yeah its my favorite city
New Yorks my home sweet home
So save your time and trouble
I say save your railroad fare
I said save your time and trouble brother
Save your railroad fare
Cause when you leave New York
Let me say you aint going nowhere
