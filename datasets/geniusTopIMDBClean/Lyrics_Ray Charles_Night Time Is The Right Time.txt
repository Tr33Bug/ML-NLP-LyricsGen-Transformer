Night Time Is  The Right Time Lyrics
You know the night time darling  Night and day 
Is the right time  Night and day 
To be  Night and day 
With the one you love now  Night and day 
Say now oh baby  Night and day 
When I come home baby now  Night and day 
I want to be with the one I love now  Night and day 
You know what Im thinking of  Night and day 
I know the night time  Night and day 
Oh is the right time  Night and day 
To be with the one you love now  Night and day 
I said to be with the one you love  Night and day 
You know my mother now  Night and day 
Had to die now  Night and day 
And my father  Night and day 
Well he broke down and cry  Night and day 
Whoa whoa baby  Night and day 
When I come home baby now  Night and day 
I want you to hold my hand  Night and day 
Yeah tight as you can  Night and day 
I know the night time  Night and day 
Oh is the right time  Night and day 
To be with the one you love now  Night and day 
You know what Im thinking of  Night and day 
Oh sing your song Margie
Baby  Night and day 
Baby  Night and day 
Baby  Night and day 
Oh baby  Night and day 
Do I love you  Night and day 
No one above you  Night and day 
Hold me tight  Night and day 
To make everything alright  Night and day 


Because the night time  Night and day 
Oh is the right time  Night and day 
To be with the one you love now  Night and day 
Oh yeah now  Night and day 
Tease me  Night and day 
Squeeze me  Night and day 
Leave me  Night and day 
Ah dont leave me  Night and day 
Oh baby  Night and day 
Take my hand now  Night and day 
I dont need  Night and day 
No other man now  Night and day 
Because the night time  Night and day 
Oh is the right time  Night and day 
To be with the one you love now  Night and day 
Oh yeah now  Night and day 
I said baby  Night and day 
Baby  Night and day 
Baby  Night and day 
Oh baby now  Night and day 
Oh come on baby  Night and day 
You know I want you by my side  Night and day 
And I want you to keep  Night and day 
Oh keep me satisfied  Night and day 
I know that that night time  Night and day 
Every day is the right time  Night and day 
Hey to be with the one you love now  Night and day 
Well  Night and day 
Yeah yeah
