They say Ruby youre like a dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so I only know
Ruby its you
They say Ruby youre like a song
You just dont know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heartaches for me
Right from the start who stole my heart
Ruby its you
I hear your voice and I must come to you  Must come to you 
I have no choice so what else can I do  What else can I do 
They say Ruby youre like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware still I just dont care
You thrill me so I only know
Ruby its you
I hear your voice and I must come to you 
I have no choice what else can I do What can I do 
They say Ruby youre like a flame
Into my life you came
And though I should beware still I dont care
You thrill me so I only know
Ruby its you
