Say no more
I think youll never understand
I have refused the same demand
All my life
Say no more
In my book there can be no blame
When you pretend I have no shame
Youre half right
All along
You kept trying to pin me down
Turn me into your house clown
If I dont fit the bill
All the same
I loved you then
I love you still
Want to know the truth
I caught a nasty bug
And when it got a hold of me
I could not shake it free
A lasting blue note
Has been haunting me
Its like an old mistress
Forever chasing me
But say no more
I may not be an easy man
But the way you played your hand
I couldnt stand
Its too bad
Theres much more we could have done
But now those days are dead and gone
Nothing lasts
All along
You made me feel this useless guilt
Can you look back on what we built
I wonder what you saw in me
Tell me was it real
Was it love
You tell me
Want to know the truth
I caught a nasty bug
And when it got a hold of me
I could not shake it free
Same lonely blue note
Has been haunting me
Its like an old mistress
Forever chasing me
And though you think of it
As the cause of my fall
Never mind Im blessed
Im here at all
