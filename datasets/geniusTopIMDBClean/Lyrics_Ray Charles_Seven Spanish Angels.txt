He looked down into her brown eyes
And said Say a prayer for me
She threw her arms around him
Whispered God will keep us free
They could hear the riders coming
He said This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They wont take me back alive
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home
She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said Father please forgive me
I cant make it without my man
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldnt win
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home


Alright yall help me now
There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun  Oh I believe 
They were praying for the lovers  Yeah they was 
In the Valley of the Gun  Well well well 
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne  Oh yeah 
And seven Spanish angels
Took another Angel home
