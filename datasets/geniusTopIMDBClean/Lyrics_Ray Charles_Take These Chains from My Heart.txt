Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Youve grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy  Sympathy 
Be as fair to my heart as you can be  You can be 
Then if you no longer care for the love thats beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  Set me free
