Up in the morning out on the job
I work like the devil for my pay
I know that a lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Roll around heaven all day 
I fuss with my woman and I toil with my kids
I sweat til Im wrinkled and gray
I know that lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above dont you see Im pining
I got tears all in my eyes
Why dont You send down that cloud
With the the silver lining
Lift me up to paradise
Lift me up to paradise 
Show me that river why dont You take me across
And wash all my troubles away
I know that lucky old sun now hes got nothing to do
Huh but just roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above cant you know Im pining
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with the silver lining
Lift me to paradise
Lift me up to paradise 
Oh show me that river and take me across
Wash all my troubles away
And I know the lucky old sun now hes got nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day yes sir
Hes got nothing but roll around heaven all day
I say he just roll around heaven all day
Now you say it  Roll around heaven all day 
Yes Lord
