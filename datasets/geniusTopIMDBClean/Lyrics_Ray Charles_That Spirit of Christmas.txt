Christmas is that time of year
For being with the ones we love
Sharing so much joy and cheer
What a wonderful feelin
Watching the ones we love
Having so much fun
I was sittin by the fire side
Taking a walk through the snow
Listening to a childrens choir
Singing songs about Jesus
The blessed way that he came to us
Why cant it remain
All through the year
Each day the same
Ah thats what I wanna hear
Heh heh its truly amazin
That spirit of Christmas
All the kinfolk gather round
The lovely Christmas tree
Hearts are glowing full of joy
Sense the gifts that were giving
And the love that were living
Why cant it remain  Why cant it remain 
Oh all through the year  All through the year 
Each day the same  Each day the same 
Ah thats what I wanna hear
Ill tell ya its truly amazin
That spirit of Christmas
Let me hear ya
Why cant it remain  Why cant it remain
All through the year  All through the year
Each day the same  Each day the same
Thats what I wanna hear
Listen to me its truly amazin
That spirit of Christmas


Oh its truly amazin
That spirit of Christmas
Aint it so Its truly amazin
Yeah that spirit of Christmas
Oh Christmas
