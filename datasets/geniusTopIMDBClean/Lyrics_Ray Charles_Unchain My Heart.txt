Unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
Baby let me be  Unchain my heart 
Unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
Cause you dont care about me  Unchain my heart 
Youve got me sewed up like a pillowcase
But you let my love go to waste
So unchain my heart oh please please set me free
Unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
Baby let me go  Unchain my heart 
Unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
Cause you dont love me no more  Unchain my heart 
Every time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that youre not at home
So unchain my heart oh please please set me free
Im under your spell  Im under your spell 
Like a man in a trance  Like a man in a trance 
But I know darn well  But I know darn well 
That I dont stand a chance  That I dont stand a chance 
So unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
Let me go my way  Unchain my heart 
Unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
You worry me night and day  Unchain my heart 
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you dont care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart oh please please set me free
Im under your spell  Im under your spell 
Like a man in a trance  Like a man in a trance 
I know darn well  But I know darn well 
That I dont stand a chance  That I dont stand a chance 
So unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
Let me go my way  Unchain my heart 
Unchain my heart  Unchain my heart 
You worry me night and day  Unchain my heart 
Why lead me through a life of misery
When you dont care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart oh please please set me free
Please set me free 
Oh wont you set me free
Please set me free 
Woah set me free
Please set me free 
Woah set me free little darling
Please set me free 
Oh wont you set me free
