The other night
As I lay sleeping
Oh I dreamed I held you
Held you in my arms
Woah but when I woke up this morning
I found out I was mistaken
Do you know that I hung my
I hung my head and cried
Woah you are my sunshine  You are my sunshine 
Oh my only sunshine  My only sunshine 
Woah little girl you make me happy sometimes  You make me happy 
When my skies are grey  When skies are grey 
Mhm youll never never never never know dear  Youll never know dear 
How much I love you  How much I love you 
But I dont want you to take  Dont take my sunshine 
My sunshine away  Shine away 
You told me once dear
That you really loved me
And no one else
Could ever come between yeah
But now you left me
And you love another yeah
And you have shattered oh yeah
All of my dreams
Woah you are my sunshine  You are my sunshine 
Oh my only sunshine  My only sunshine 
Oh you make me happy sometimes  You make me happy 
When the skies are grey  When skies are grey 
Woah youll never never never never know dear  Youll never know dear 
How much I love you  How much I love you 
Woah I dont want you to take  Dont take my sunshine 
Woah if you love me  Dont take my sunshine 
Mhm if you need me  Dont take my sunshine

Oh oh yes sir listen  Dont take my sunshine
