You dont love me
You dont know me
You give your hand to me and then you say Hello
And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell you think you know me well
Well you dont know me  No you dont know me 
No you dont know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
Oh Im just a friend thats all Ive ever been
Cause you dont know me  No you dont know me 
Oh I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too  Love me too 
You give your hand to me and then you say Goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh to never never know the one who loved you so
Well you dont know me
Oh I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too  Love me too 
Oh you give your hand to me and then you say Goodbye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh you never never know the one who loved you so
Well you dont know me
You dont love me
You dont know me
