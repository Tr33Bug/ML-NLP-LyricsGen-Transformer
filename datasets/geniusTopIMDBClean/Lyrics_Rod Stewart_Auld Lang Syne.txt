Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And the days of auld lang syne
For auld lang syne my dear
For auld lang syne
Well drink a cup of kindness yet
For the sake of auld lang syne
And surely you will buy your cup
And surely Ill buy mine
Well take a cup of kindness yet
For the sake of auld lang syne
We two have paddled in the stream
From morning sun till night
The seas between us Lord and swell
Since the days of auld lang syne
For old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
For the sake of auld lang syne
For old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
In the days of auld lang syne
For auld lang syne my dear
For auld lang syne
Well drink a cup of kindness yet
For the sake of auld lang syne
