Baby Jane dont leave me hanging on the line
I knew you when you had no one to talk to
Now youre moving in high society
Dont forget I know secrets about you
I used to think you were on my side
But now Im no longer sure
I wish I knew what I know now before
When I give my heart again
I know its gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know its gonna last forever
Baby Jane dont it make you feel sad
Just when I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way
Dont time fly when youre loving and laughing
Ive said goodbye so many times
The situation aint all that new
Optimisms my best defense
Ill get through without you
When I give my heart again
I know its gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know its gonna last forever
I wont be that dumb again
I know its gotta last forever
When I fall in love again
I know its gonna last forever
Baby Jane Ive said all I want to say
Go your own way dont think twice about me
Cause Ive got ideas and plans of my own
So long darlin Ill miss you believe me
The lesson learned was so hard to swallow
But I know that Ill survive
Im gonna take a good look at myself and cry
When I give my heart again
I know its gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know its gonna last forever
When I fall in love next time
I know its gonna last forever
I wont be that dumb again
I know itll last forever
