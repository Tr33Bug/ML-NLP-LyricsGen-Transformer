Blondes  Have More Fun  Lyrics
Is it a matter of opinion
Or just a contradiction
But from where I come from
All the blondes have more fun
Well just awatch them sisters on a Saturday night
Peroxide causin all the fights
I took a rose in Texas
She gimme plenty of practice
But I couldnt touch the surface
Cause of recent facelift
She had no idea what loves about
Cept the one oclock call on the casting couch
Sissy from New York
Was on the cover of New Vogue
I aint supposed to be available
So completely untouchable
I got a limousine n bodyguard and chaperone
But God knows Rodder just needs to ball
You can keep your black and your redheads
You can keep your brunettes too
I wanna girl thats semi intelligent
Gimme a blonde thats six feet two boy
And that aint all
I had a crush on Bardot
Fell in love with Monroe
Read about em in the nationals
All the juicy little scandals
But I never saw em dancin at the county hall
With the short fat guys prematurely bald
Dig this
You can keep your black and your redheads
You can keep your brunettes too
Dont wanna subservient woman
Gimme a blonde thats six feet two boy
And that aint all
