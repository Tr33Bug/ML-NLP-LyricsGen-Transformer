Once upon a time before I took up smiling
I hated the moonlight
Shadows of the night that poets find beguiling
Seemed flat as the moonlight
With no one to stay up for I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup for the saddest of all men
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heard somebody whisper Please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms would ever hold
I heard somebody whisper Please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Now I have a girl of my own
