Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around
Do you feel what I feel
Can we make it so thats part of the deal
Ive gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line this time
I wanna breathe when you breathe
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze
Count the beads of sweat that cover me
Didnt you show me a sign this time
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around
Do you feel what I feel
Do you feel what I feel
Can you see what I see
Can you cut behind the mystery
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind
I wanna come when you call
Ill get to you if I have to crawl
They cant hold me with these iron walls
We got mountains to climb to climb
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
Turning my whole world around
