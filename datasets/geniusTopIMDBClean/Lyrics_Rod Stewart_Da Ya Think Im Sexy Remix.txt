Da Ya Think Im Sexy  Remix  Lyrics
Oh
Nah
Yeah yeah yeah
She sits alone waitin for suggestions
Hes so nervous avoidin all the questions
His lips are dry his heart is gently poundin
Dont you just know exactly what theyre thinkin
His hearts beatin like a drum  Like a drum 
Is he gonna get this girl home
Real soon baby well be all alone
Dont you just know exactly what theyre thinkin
If you want my body and you think Im sexy
Come on sugar tell me so ooh
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so ooh  Alright 
Hes actin shy lookin for an answer
Come on honey lets spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his highrise apartment
At last he can tell exactly what his heart meant
If you want my body and you think Im sexy
Come on sugar tell me so ooh  Tell me so 
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so ooh
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh ooh
I like this I like this I like this
Come on baby spend the night
I promise to behave myself
Ah yeah ah yeah
Yeahyeahyeah yeahyeahyeah
His hearts beatin like a drum  Like a drum 
Is he gonna get this girl home  Is he 
Real soon baby well be alone
Dont you just know exactly what theyre thinkin
If you want my body and you think Im sexy
Come on sugar tell me so ooh
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so ooh  Uh tell me so 
If you really really really need me
Just let me know just let me know  If you really need me 
If you really really really need me
Just let me know just let me know  Ah yeah yeah
