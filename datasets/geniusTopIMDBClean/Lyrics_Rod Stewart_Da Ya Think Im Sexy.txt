Sugar sugar
Ooh
She sits alone waitin for suggestions
Hes so nervous avoidin all the questions
His lips are dry his heart is gently poundin
Dont you just know exactly what theyre thinkin
If you want my body and you think Im sexy
Come on sugar let me know ooh
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so ooh  Tell me so baby 
Hes actin shy lookin for an answer
Come on honey lets spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his highrise apartment
At last he can tell exactly what his heart meant
If you want my body and you think Im sexy
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know oh
If you want my body and you think Im sexy
Come on sugar let me know ooh
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so ooh  Tell me so baby 
His hearts beating like a drum
Cause at last hes got this girl home
Relax baby now we are all alone oh
They wake at dawn cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that aint what theyre thinking
Outside its cold misty and its raining
They got each other neither ones complaining
He says Im sorry but Im out of milk and coffee
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie
If you want my body and you think Im sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
If you really really really really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me
If you really want me
Just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
If you if you if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so
