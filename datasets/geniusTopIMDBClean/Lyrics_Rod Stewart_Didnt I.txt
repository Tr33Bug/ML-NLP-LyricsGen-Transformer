There are times to remember
And times that I wish to forget
Our time together was tinged with love and regret
Oh my girl
My sweet sweet little girl
Didnt I try to tell ya that life was for living
Oh didnt I
And wasnt I the guy who said stay away from that tribe
Oh wasnt I
And didnt I try to tell you thats stuffs gonna kill ya
Oh didnt I
But you thought it was cool and I was just an old fool
Oh look at ya
You left home for the city with Hollywood stars in your eyes
Now your mother God bless her cries herself to sleep every night
Oh my girl my sweet innocent girl
Didnt I search the streets for the beggars pimps and cheats
Oh didnt I
And didnt I try to guide you to a baptism of fire
Oh didnt I
And didnt I try to warn ya bout that folk in California
Oh didnt I
But you said daddy please dont worry I got friends out there who love me
Now look at ya
Oh baby come back home we can work this out
There is no blame
I wanna hold you close and stroke your hair and share your pain
Didnt I do the best for you try to make you stay in school
Didnt I
Once I was your hero but I went from ten to zero
Oh didnt I Now listen
For a roll on the dice you nearly paid the ultimate price
Oh didnt ya
Now I stand by your bedside watching you fight for you life


Wheres the innocence  Wheres the innocence  
Wheres the future  Where is the future 
Where the beauty  Ooo 
Wheres the promise  Where is the promise 
There are times to remember
And times that I wish to forget
