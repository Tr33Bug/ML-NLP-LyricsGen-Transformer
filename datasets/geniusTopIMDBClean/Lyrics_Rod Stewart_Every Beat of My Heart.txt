Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Wheres my family and my country
Heaven knows where I belong
Pack my bags tonight heres one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train in the pouring rain
Say farewell but dont say goodbye
Seagull carry me over land and sea
To my own folk thats where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
Im lost and alone in the dark
Im going home
One more glass of wine just for Auld Lang Syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now in my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine
Seagull carry me over land and sea
To my own folk thats where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
Im lost and alone in the dark
Im going home
And well drink a toast to the blood red rose
Cheer a while the Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights and the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry


Seagull carry me over land and sea
To my own folk thats where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
Im lost and alone in the dark
Im going home
