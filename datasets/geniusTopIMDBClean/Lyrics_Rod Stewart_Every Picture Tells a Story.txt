Spent some time feelin inferior
Standing in front of my mirror
Combed my hair in a thousand ways
But I came out looking just the same
Daddy said Son you better see the world
I wouldnt blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing dont lose your head
To a woman thatll spend your bread
So I got out woo
Paris was a place you could hide away
If you felt you didnt fit in
French police wouldnt give me no peace
They claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the Left Bank minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot
When all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused woo
I moved on
Down in Rome I wasnt getting enough
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk but I kept my funk woo
At a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate indeed I was yeah
Looking like a tourist attraction
Oh my dear I better get out of here
fore the Vatican dont give no sanction
I wasnt ready for that no no
I moved right out east yeah listen
On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a sliteyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon
Shangai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just aint natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh people I was glad I found her
Oh yeah I was glad I found her woohoo
Wait a minute
I firmly believe that I didnt need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be
The women Ive known I wouldnt let tie my shoe
They wouldnt give you the time of day
But the sliteyed lady knocked me off my feet
God I was glad I found her
And if they had the words I could tell to you
To help you on the way down the road
I couldnt quote you no Dickens Shelley or Keats
Cause its all been said before
Make the best out of the bad just laugh it off ha
You didnt have to come here anyway
So remember every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it woo
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it woo
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it woo
Every picture tells a story dont it woo
Every picture tells a story dont it woo
Every picture tells a story dont it woo
Every picture tells a story dont it woo
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
Every picture tells a story dont it
