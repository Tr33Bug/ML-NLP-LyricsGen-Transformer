Its been a long road
Gettin from there to here
Its been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I can feel the change in the wind right now
Nothings in my way
And theyre not gonna hold me down no more
No theyre not gonna hold me down
Cause Ive got faith of the heart
Im goin where my heart will take me
Ive got faith to believe
I can do anythin
Ive got strength of the soul
No ones going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
Ive got faith  Ive got faith 
Faith of the heart
Its been a long night
Tryin to find my way
Been through the darkness
Now I finally have my day
And I will see my dream come alive at last
I will touch the sky
And theyre not gonna hold me down no more
No theyre not gonna change my mind
Cause Ive got faith of the heart
Im goin where my heart will take me
Ive got faith to believe
I can do anythin
Ive got strength of the soul
And no ones going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
Ive got faith  Ive got faith 
Faith of the heart
I know the winds so cold
Ive seen the darkest days
But now the winds I feel
Are only winds of change
Ive been through the fire
And Ive been through the rain
But Ill be fine
Cause Ive got faith of the heart
Im goin where my heart will take me
Ive got faith to believe
I can do anythin
Ive got strength of the soul
And no ones going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
Ive got Ive got 
Ive got faith
Faith of the heart
Im goin where my heart will take me
Ive got faith to believe
And no ones going to bend nor break me
I can reach any star
Cause Ive got faith
Cause Ive got faith
Faith of the heart
Its been a long road
