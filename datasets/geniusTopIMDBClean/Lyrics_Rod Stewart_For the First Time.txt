Are those your eyes Is that your smile
I been looking at you forever
Yet I never saw you before
Are these your hands holding mine
Now I wonder how I could have been so blind
And for the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time Im seeing who you are
I cant believe how much I see
When youre looking back at me
Now I understand what love is love is
For the first time
Oh yeah
Can this be real Can this be true
Am I the person I was this morning
And are you the same you
Its all so strange how can it be
All along this love was right in front of me
And for the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I am seeing who you are
I cant believe how much I see
When youre looking back at me
Now I understand what love is love is
For the first time
Such a long time ago
I had given up on finding this emotion
Ever again
But youre here with me now
Yes I found you somehow
And Ive never been so sure
For the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time Im seeing who you are
Cant believe how much I see
When youre looking back at me
Now I understand what love is love is
For the first time
For the first time
