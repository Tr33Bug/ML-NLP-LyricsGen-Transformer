I think I know now whats making me sad
Its a yearnin for my own back yard
I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride
Going home running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home and Im running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born
When the weathers better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind dont whistle round my knees
Ill put on my weddin suit and catch the evening train
Ill be home before the milks upon the door
Going home running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Going home and Im running home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I was born
But if anything should happen and my plans go wrong
Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
Id be singing in my alley if I could
And if Im called away and its my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor Ill be asking of you
Dont bury me here its too cold
Take me back carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back wont you carry me home
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Take me back carry me back
Down to Gasoline Alley where I started from
Woohoo
