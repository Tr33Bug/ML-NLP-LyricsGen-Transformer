Someone told me long ago
Theres a calm before the storm
I know
Its been comin for some time
When its over so they say
Itll rain a sunny day
I know
Shinin down like water
I want to know have you ever seen the rain
I want to know have you ever seen the rain
Comin down on a sunny day
Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know
Been that way for all my time
Til forever on it goes
Through the circle fast and slow
I know
It cant stop I wonder
I want to know have you ever seen the rain
I want to know have you ever seen the rain
Comin down on a sunny day
Yeah
I want to know have you ever seen the rain
I want to know have you ever seen the rain
Comin down on a sunny day
