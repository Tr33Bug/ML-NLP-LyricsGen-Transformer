Whos that knocking on my door
Its gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again coming round for more
Well you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure youre gone
Im talkin to you
Hot legs
Wearing me out
Hot legs
You can scream and shout
Hot legs
Are you still in school
I love you honey
Got a most persuasive tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you dont understand
Im a working man
Gonna need a shot of vitamin E
By the time youre finished with me
Im talking to you
Hot legs
Youre an alley cat
Hot legs
You scratch my back
Hot legs
Bring your mother too
I love you honey
Imagine how my daddy felt
In your jet black suspender belt
Seventeen years old
Hes touching sixty four
You got legs right up to your neck
Youre making me a physical wreck
Im talking to you
Hot legs
In your satin shoes
Hot legs
Are you still in school
Hot legs
Youre making me a fool
I love you honey

Hot legs
Making your mark
Hot legs
You keep my pencil sharp
Hot legs
Keep your hands to yourself
I love you honey
Hot legs
Youre wearing me out
Hot legs
You can scream and shout
Hot legs
Youre still in school
I love you honey
