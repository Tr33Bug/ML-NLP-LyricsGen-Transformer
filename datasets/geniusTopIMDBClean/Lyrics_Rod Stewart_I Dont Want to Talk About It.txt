I can tell by your eyes
That youve probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky dont mean nothing to you
Theyre a mirror
I dont wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart
Oh my heart
If I stand all alone
Will the shadow hide the color of my heart
Blue for the tears black for the nights fears
The stars in the sky dont mean nothing to you
Theyre a mirror
I dont wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart
Oh my heart
I dont wanna talk about it
How you broke this ole heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart
Oh my heart
My heart
Oh my heart
