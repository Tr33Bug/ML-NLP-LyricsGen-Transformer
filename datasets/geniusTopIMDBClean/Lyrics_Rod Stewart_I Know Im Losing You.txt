I Know  Im Losing You Lyrics
Your love is fading can feel your love fading
Woman its fading away from me
Cause your personal touch its growin cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I fooled myself as long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
Its there when you speak my name
Its just not the same
Oh honey Im losing you
Can feel in the air
Its there everywhere
Oh Im losing you
I can feel it in my bones
Any day youll be up and gone
Woo Im losing you
Its all over your face
Some ones taken my place
Could it be that Im losing you
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
Im hurt downhearted and worried girl
Cause that face doesnt belong to me woo
Your love is fading can feel it fading
Oh away from me
Can feel it in the air
Its there everywhere
Ooh Im losing you
I dont wanna lose ya
But I know Im gonna grew ya
Oh Lord Im losing you
Woo
Get out
Woo
Woohoo
Ooh yeah
Get down
Get down there
Woo
I dont wanna lose ya
But I know Im gonna grew ya
Oh no Im losing you Im losing you
Woo
Woo
Woo
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Woo
Your love is fading I can feel it fading
Oh Im losing you
