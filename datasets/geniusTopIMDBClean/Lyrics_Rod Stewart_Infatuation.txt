Early in the morning I cant sleep
I cant work and I cant eat
Ive been drunk all day cant concentrate
Maybe Im making a big mistake
Caught me down like a killer shark
Its like a railroad running right through my heart
Jekyll and Hyde the way I behave
Feel like Im running on an empty gauge
Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I dont understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Heartbeats silly like a big bass drum
Losing all equilibrium
Its so hard in the middle of the week
Maybe this womans just all I need
Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I dont understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Fatuate me baby
Spirits soar when Im by her side
She put a little love in this heart of mine
Maybe Im lucky maybe Im freed
Maybe this womans just all I need
Oh no not again
It hurts so good
I dont understand
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Rev it up
