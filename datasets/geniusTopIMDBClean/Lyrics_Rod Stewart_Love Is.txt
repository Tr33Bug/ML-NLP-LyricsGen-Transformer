And so you come to me with your questions
On a subject on which Im wellversed
Though Im still as dumbfounded as the first time I found her
Its either a blessing or a curse
Although I cannot offer solutions
It would be reckless of me to try
Cause its mystified man ever since time began
But hold on to your hat and Ill try
Love is like a burning arrow
It can pierce the coldest heart
Love is warm love is patient
And the craziest thing youll ever start alright
I recall when I was a young man
A day Im never allowed to forget
There was a girl that I met who I dreamed I would wed
Forever our lives entwined
She said You gotta stop worrying about the future
You know were far too young for that
I wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring
I never saw her pretty face again
Love is life love is yearning
It does not boast but speaks the truth
Love is fair and knows no boundaries
And the craziest thing youll ever do oh yeah
Come on now
I wish you well in all of your travels
And may you find what youre searching for
Itll hit you like thunder when you find one another
And stay in your heart forevermore
Love is like a fourleaf clover
Hard to find and hold onto
Love is blind love is tender
And the craziest thing youll ever do
So crazy
