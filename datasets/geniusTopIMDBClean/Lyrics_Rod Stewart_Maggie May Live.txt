Maggie May  Live  LyricsWake up Maggie I think Ive got something to say to you
Its late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I fell Im being used
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried any more
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and thats what really hurts
The morning sun when its in your eyes really shows your age
But that dont worry me none in my eyes youre everything
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didnt need to coax
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried any more
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and thats a pain I can do without
All I needed was a friend to lend a helping hand
But you turned into a lover and mother
What a lover you wore me out all you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried any more
You led me away from home
Cause you didnt want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldnt leave you if I tried
I suppose I could collected my books and go on back to school
Or steal my daddys cue and make a living at playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie I wished Id never seen your face
You made a first class fool out of me
But Im as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
Id never seen your face
Ill get on back home one of these days
