Wake up Maggie
I think I got somethin to say to you
Its late September
And I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused
But I feel Im being used
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and thats what really hurts
The morning sun when its in your face
Really shows your age
But that dont worry me none
In my eyes youre everything
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didnt need to coax
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and thats a pain I can do without
All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover
You wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Cause you didnt want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldnt leave you if I tried


I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school
Or steal my daddys cue
And make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie I wished Id never seen your face
You made a firstclass fool out of me
But Im as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
Maggie I wished Id never seen your face
Ill get on back home one of these days
Ooh ooh ooh
