When the rain came I thought youd leave
Cause I knew how much you loved the sun
But you chose to stay stay and keep me warm
Through the darkest nights Ive ever known
If the mandolin wind couldnt change a thing
Then I know I love ya
Oh the snow fell without a break
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
I couldnt believe you kept a smile
Now I can rest assured knowing that we seen the worst
And I know I love ya
Oh I never was good with romantic words
So the next few lines come really hard
Dont have much but what Ive got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
Ha cause I know you dont play
But Ill teach you one day
Because I love ya
I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt Id let you down
No mandolin wind couldnt change a thing
Couldnt change a thing no no
Ooh ooh ooh
Ladada laladadadada
Ladadada ladadadada
The coldest winter in almost fourteen years
Could never never change your mind yeah ooh
And I love ya
Yes indeed and I love ya
And I love ya
Lordy I love ya woohoo
And I love ya
Lord I love ya
