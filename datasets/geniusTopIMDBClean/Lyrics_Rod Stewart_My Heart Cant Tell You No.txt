I dont want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You dont know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
Cause when you say its over with him
I want to believe its true
So I let you in knowing tomorow
Im gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Dont you know its torture
I mean its a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I wont lose control
But one look in your blue eyes and suddenly
My heart cant tell you no
I dont want you to call me up no more
Saying you need me
Youre crazy if you think just half your love
Could ever please me
Still I want to hold you touch you
When you look at me that way
Theres only one solution I know it
You gotta stay away from me
Stay away from me
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Dont you know its torture
I mean its a living hell
No matter how I try to convince myself
This time I wont lose control
One look in your sad eyes
And suddenly my heart cant tell you no
My heart cant tell you no
I dont want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You dont know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me
Cause when you say its over with him
I want to believe its true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
Im gonna wake up missing you
Wake up missing you
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Dont you know its torture
I mean its a living hell
When the one you love is in love with someone else
Dont you know its torture
I mean its a living hell
Living hell
