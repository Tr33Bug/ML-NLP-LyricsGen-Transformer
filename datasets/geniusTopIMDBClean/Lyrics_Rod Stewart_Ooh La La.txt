Poor old Granddad I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of womens ways
Theyll trap you then they use you
And before you even know
For love is blind and youre far too kind
Dont ever let it show
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
The cancan such a pretty show
Its steal your heart away
But backstage back on earth again
The dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it aint too long
Fore they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
Youre just a boy again
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Woo
Woo
When you want her lips you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more then shes fast asleep
Leaves you twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson theres nothing I can say
Youll have to learn just like me
And thats the hardest way
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger
Ooh la la
Ooh la la yeah yeah
Ooh la la
Ooh la la yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh la la
Ooh la la
Ooh la la yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh la la
