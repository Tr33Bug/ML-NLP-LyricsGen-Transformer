Somebody somewhere
In the heat of the night
Looking pretty dangerous
Running out of patience
Tonight in the city
You wont find any pity
Hearts are being twisted
Another lover cheated cheated
In the bars and the cafes passion
In the streets and the alleys passion
A lot of pretending passion
Everybody searching passion
Once in love youre never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
Passion passion
Passion passion
New York Moscow passion
Hong Kong Tokyo passion
Paris and Bangkok passion
A lotta people aint got passion
Hear it in the radio passion
Read it in the papers passion
Hear it in the churches passion
See it in the school yards passion
Once in love youre never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
Once in love youre never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah
Alone in your bed at night passion
Its half past midnight passion
As you turn out your sidelight passion
Something aint right passion
Theres no passion theres no passion
Theres no passion I need passion
You need passion we need passion
Cant live without passion
Wont live without passion
Cant live without passion
Even the president needs passion
Everybody I know needs some passion
Some people die and kill for passion
Nobody admits they need passion
Some people are scared of passion
Yeah passion
