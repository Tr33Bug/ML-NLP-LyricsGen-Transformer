Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
Alone in a crowd on a bus after work and Im dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you
It seems so unfair when theres love everywhere but theres none for me
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
Someone to take on a walk by the lake Lord let it be me
Someone whos shy someone wholl cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was fooling me
Youre just a dream and as real as it seems I aint that lucky
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
All of my friends have a ring on their finger they have someone
Someone to care for them it aint fair I got no one
The car overheated I called up and pleaded theres help on the way
I called you collect you didnt accept you had nothing to say
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
But if you were here with me
Id feel so happy I could cry
You are so dear to me
I just cant let you say goodbye
