You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
Id rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do
Im only just beginning
To see the real you
And sometimes when we touch
The honestys too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you til the fear in me subsides
Romance and all its strategies
Leaves me battling with my pride
But for all the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
Im just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prizefighter
Still trapped within my youth
And sometimes when we touch
The honestys too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you til the fear in me subsides
At times Id like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times Id like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
Ive watched while love commands you
And Ive watched love pass you by
At times I think were drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again
And sometimes when we touch
The honestys too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you til the fear in me subsides subsides
