Woo
Get it
In the mornin dont say you love me
Cause Ill only kick you out of the door
I know your name is Rita
Cause your perfumes smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor
Guitar
You wont need too much pursuadin
I dont mean to sound degradin
But with a face like that
You got nothin to laugh about
Red lips hair and fingernails
I hear youre a mean old Jezebel
Lets go upstairs
And read my tarot cards come on
Stay with me stay with me
For tonight youd better stay with me oh yeah
Stay with me stay with me
For tonight youd better stay with me
So in the mornin please dont say you love me
Cause you know Ill only kick you out the door
Yeah Ill pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just dont be here in the mornin when I wake up
Come on honey
Stay with me stay with me
Cause tonight youre gonna stay with me
Sit down get up get out
Stay with me stay with me
Cause tonight youre gonna stay with me
Hey whats your name again
Get out
