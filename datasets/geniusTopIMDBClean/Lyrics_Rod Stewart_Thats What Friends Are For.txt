Oh I never thought Id feel this way
And as far as Im concerned
Im glad Ive got a chance to say
That I do believe I love you
And if I I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember
Keep smilin  Smilin 
Keep shining  Shinin 
Knowin you can always count on me for sure
Thats what friends are for
For the good times  Good times 
And the bad times  Bad times 
Ill be on your side forevermore
Thats what friends are for yeah
And now though you heard it all before
Well I tell you one more time
So I can be completely sure
So you know how much I love you
And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do this day
And then if you can remember
Keep smilin  Smilin 
Keep shining  Shinin 
Knowin you can always count on me for sure
Thats what friends are for
For the good times  Good times 
And the bad times  Bad times 
Ill be on your side forevermore
Thats what friends are for
