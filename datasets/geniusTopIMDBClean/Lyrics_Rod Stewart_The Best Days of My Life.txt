You always said living with me was impossible
Try it I said just like the wind Im changeable
We aint got money but we sure got laughs
Lots of loving too
So I confess on my behalf
Youre giving me honestly
The best days of my life
Your whispering girls said dont be a fool
Dont give into him
Hes an animal treat you like dirt
Then hell turn you in
You two are not compatible
Itll never never last
They said I wasnt even suitable
But youre giving me honestly
The best days of my life
Sometimes I wonder
Why does she bother with me at all
So staid in my ways
Lets face it my dear Im insufferable
The crazy nights spilling into days
With all my noisy friends
But they all love you as much as i
Giving me constantly
The best days of my life
And a day without you at this point my dear
Seems unthinkable
A night without you more often
Than not is unbearable
But if it all cant work out
One can never never tell
In my heart there is no doubt
You gave to me unselfishly
The best days of my life
But if it all cant work out one can never never tell
