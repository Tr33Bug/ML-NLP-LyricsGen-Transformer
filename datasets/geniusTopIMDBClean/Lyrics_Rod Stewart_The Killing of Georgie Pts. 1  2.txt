The Killing of Georgie Pts 1  2 Lyrics
Oh yeah
In these days of changing ways
Socalled liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine
Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin more or nothin less
The kindest guy I ever knew
His mothers tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest
Pa said There must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all Ive said and done for him
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Leavin home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way
Accepted by Manhattans elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George
Along the boulevards hed cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy


Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of 75
He said he was in love I said Im pleased
George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell
Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down Fifth Avenue
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passerby
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgies head hit a sidewalk cornerstone
A leather kid a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night
The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on FiftyThird and Third
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Georgies life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote
He said Never wait or hesitate
Get in kid before its too late
You may never get another chance
Cause youths a mask but it dont last
Live it long and live it fast
Georgie was a friend of mine
Oh yeah
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Dododododododo
Oh Georgie stay dont go away
Georgie please stay you take our breath away
Oh Georgie stay dont go away
Georgie please stay you take our breath away
Oh Georgie stay dont go away
Georgie Georgie please stay you take our breath away
Oh Georgie stay
