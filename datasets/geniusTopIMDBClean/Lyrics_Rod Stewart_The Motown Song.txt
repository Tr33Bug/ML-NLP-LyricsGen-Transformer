Well put the speakers in the window and well go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo through the alley down below oh yeah
Lets dance together just for the night
Lets dont worry about the future or nothing else
Cause like the musics saying you gotta take chances
Go ahead just do it and trust yourself

Saying everythings gonna be alright
Bring over some of your old Motown records
Well put the speakers in the window and well go

They wish us luck but they think were just dreaming
Lets prove them wrong baby

Well put the speakers in the window and well go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo through the alley down below oh yeah
