This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away I feel youre gonna stay
Lonely nights that come memories that go
Bringing you back again hurting me more and more
Maybe its my mistake to show this love that I feel inside
Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if Im coming or going cause
I love you yes I do this old heart
I love you yes I do yes I do wait for me
I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me crying
The way youre treatin me leaves me incomplete
Youre here for the day gone for the week
But if leave me a hundred times a hundred times Ill take you back
Im yours whenever you want me
Im not too proud to shout it tell the world about it cause
I love you this old heart weeps for you
And I love you I love you this old heart weeps for you
Maybe its my mistake to show this love that I feel inside girl
Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if Im coming or going cause
I love you yes I do this old heart of mine weeps for you
I love you yes I do I love you this old heart darling weeps for you
I love you this old heart of mine weeps for you
Love you yes I do I love you this old heart darling weeps for you
I love you yes I do yes I do I love you oh yeah
