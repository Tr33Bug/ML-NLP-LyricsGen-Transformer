Tonights the Night  Gonna Be Alright  Lyrics
Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too
Disconnect the telephone line
Relax baby and draw that blind
Kick off your shoes and sit right down
Loosen off that pretty French gown
Let me pour you a good long drink
Ooh baby dont you hesitate cause
Tonights the night
Its gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl
Aint nobody gonna stop us now
Cmon angel my hearts on fire
Dont deny your mans desire
Youd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside cause
Tonights the night
Its gonna be alright
Cause I love you girl
Aint nobody gonna stop us now
Dont say a word my virgin child
Just let your inhibitions run wild
The secret is about to unfold
Upstairs before the nights too old


Tonights the night
Its gonna be alright
Cause I love you woman
Aint nobody gonna stop us now
