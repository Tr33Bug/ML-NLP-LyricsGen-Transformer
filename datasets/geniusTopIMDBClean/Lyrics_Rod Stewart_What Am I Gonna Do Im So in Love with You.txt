What Am I Gonna Do  Im So in Love with You  Lyrics
Can I tell you what you mean to me
Youre as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe that youre mine
Youre like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
Yes you are
Something youve got is something I need right now
You dont have to prove it no more
Im down on my bended knees honey
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
One in a million oh so rare
A nightingale in Berkeley Square
And baby I aint goin nowhere without you
You are the goal that wins the game
The very last bus home in the rain
Youre like rock and roll and champagne
All in one
Something youve got is something I need right now
Lets not mess around anymore
Im down on my bended knees honey
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
Ill be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you any time
The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrows fashion and now Ive found you
Im complete


Something youve got is something I need right now
You dont have to prove it no more
Im down on my bended knees honey
What am I gonna do Im so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away
Im like a schoolboy in your hands
I wanna get up and sing and dance
You see one hell of a happy man standing here
Individually quite unique
You really swept me off my feet
And baby you look oh so neat
With nothing on
