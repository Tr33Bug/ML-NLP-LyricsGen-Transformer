When I need you
I just close my eyes and Im with you
And all that I so want to give you
Its only a heartbeat away
When I need love
I hold out my hand and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone cant take the place of your smile
But you know I wont be travellin forever
Its cold out but hold out
And do like I do
When I need you
I just close my eyes and Im with you
And all that I so want to give you babe
Its only a heartbeat away
Its not easy when the road is your driver
Honey thats a heavy load that we bear
But you know I wont be travellin a lifetime
Its cold out so hold out
And do like I do
When I need you
Mmm
Mmm yes
When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
When I need you
I just close my eyes and youre right here by my side
Keepin me warm night and day
I just hold out my hands
I just hold out my hands
And Im with you darlin
Yes Im with you darlin
All I wanna give you
Its only a heartbeat away
Oh I need you darlin
