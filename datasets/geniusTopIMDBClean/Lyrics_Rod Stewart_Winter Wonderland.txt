Sleigh bells ring are you listening
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
Were happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Well pretend that he is Parson Brown
Hell say Are you married
Well say No man
But you can do the job
When youre in town
Later on well conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that weve made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Ah yeah winter wonderland
Oh yeah winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
In the meadow we can build a snowman 
And pretend that hes a circus clown
And pretend that hes a circus clown 
Well have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down
Sleigh bells ring are you listening  Sleigh bells ring 
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
Were happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Were walking in a winter wonderland  Wonderland
