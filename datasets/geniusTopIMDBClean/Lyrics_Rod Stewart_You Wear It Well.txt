I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
Ive been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell its been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but thats all right
Well I suppose youre thinking I bet hes sinking
Or he wouldnt get in touch with me
Oh I aint begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There aint a lady in the land so fine
Remember them basement parties your brothers karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Havent left a mark on you you wear it well
A little out of time but I dont mind
But I aint forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin
Now Im eatin my heart out
Tryin to get a letter through
Since youve been gone its hard to carry on
Im gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth but for what its worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you
Anyway my coffees cold and Im getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and youre home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I dont object if you call collect
cos I aint forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin
Now Im eatin my heart out tryin to get back to you
I love you I love you I love you
After all the years I hope its the same address
Since youve been gone its hard to carry on
