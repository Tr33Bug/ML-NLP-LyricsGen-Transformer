Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket
And a head full of dreams
He said Somehow someway
Its gotta get better than this
Patti packed her bags
Left a note for her mama
She was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye
They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited
We got just one shot of life
Lets take it while were still not afraid
Because life is so brief
And time is a thief when youre undecided
And like a fistful of sand
It can slip right through your hands
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Dont let them put you down
Dont let em push you around
Dont let em ever change your point of view
Paradise was closed
So they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a tworoom apartment
That was jumping every night of the week
Happiness was found in each others arms
As expected yeah
Billy pierced his ears
Drove a pickup like a lunatic ooh


Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Dont let them put you down
Dont let em push you around
Dont let em ever change your point of view
Come on babe
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on on your side
Billy wrote a letter back home
To Pattis parents tryin to explain
He said Were both real sorry
That it had to turn out this way
But there aint no point in talking
When theres nobody listening
So we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a tenpound baby boy yeah
Young hearts be free tonight time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight time is on your side
Young hearts gotta run free
Be free live free
Time is on time is on your side
Time time time time is on your side
Is on your side
Is on your side
Is on your side
Young heart be free tonight
Tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight yeah
