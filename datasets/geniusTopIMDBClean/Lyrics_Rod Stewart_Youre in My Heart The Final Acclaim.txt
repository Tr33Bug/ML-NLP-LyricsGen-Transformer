Youre in My Heart  The Final Acclaim  Lyrics
I didnt know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense Beardsley prints
I put down to experience
The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you
Youre in my heart youre in my soul
Youll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover youre my best friend
Youre in my soul
My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
Youre ageless timeless lace and fineness
Youre beauty and elegance
Youre a rhapsody a comedy
Youre a symphony and a play
Youre every love song ever written
But honey what do you see in me
Youre in my heart youre in my soul
Youll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover youre my best friend
Youre in my soul
Youre an essay in glamour
Please pardon the grammar
But youre every schoolboys dream
Youre Celtic United but baby Ive decided
Youre the best team Ive ever seen
And there have been many affairs
Many times Ive thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
Cause youre the warmest thing Ive ever found
Youre in my heart youre in my soul
Youll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover youre my best friend
Youre in my soul
Youre in my heart youre in my soul
Youll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover youre my best friend
Youre in my soul
Youre in my heart youre in my soul
Youll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover youre my best friend
Youre in my soul
