Heard that they said that its rainin men
But the offer that I make it wont be made again
You dont have to write you dont have to call
Its a onetime offer for nothing at all
And theres no red tape I dont make it hard
You dont need cash money or a Master Card
I got easy terms and a layaway
But I need a quick decision and I need it today
And if you find that you dont like my ways
Well you can send me back in 30 days
Now have you ever seen a man with a guarantee
Well youre lookin at him now cause the man is me
And if you dont believe all the things I say
Im certified prime by the USDA
Now the name that I use is DJ Run
And Im a fasttalkin slowwalkin number one
And if you dont believe all the words I say
Then youre a natural born fool whos got to be that way
I got a 50 rating and a 50 share
Every minute every hour that Im on the air
And when I come to town Im on a big marquee
It says  DJ Run  and me DMC
And if you find that you dont like my ways
Well you can send me back in 30 days


A good job and lots of money might not be enough
And to satisfy your needs it may be rough
But Ill take some care and treat you nice
And if it aint sufficient once I cold work it out twice
And if you find that you dont like my ways
Well you can send me back in 30 days
Im gonna give you everything that you ever need
If you need a pint of blood then Ill even bleed
If youre lookin for a car I will buy you two
And if youre lookin for a pet Ill buy a kangaroo
If you need a vacation we can fly the world
And youll know Ill never look at another girl
Im a singleminded man and my mind is set
Youre the lady of the 80s that Im gonna get
And if you find you dont like my ways
Well you can send me back in 30 days
