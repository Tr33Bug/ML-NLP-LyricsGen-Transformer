Ay papi tu sabe yo tengo fiebre para ti
Got senoritas in Adidas over in Spain
The Don of San Juan got em goin insane
Got chicks in Spanish Harlem holdin they brain
In So Paulo they follow doin the same
Admiration for Run since Sucker MCs
Papi bilingual sell a single with ease
Yall think that Im done Run dont got no flow
What is you loco  Im grande gato papo
Run and Bo DMC and Fat Joe
Fo cats on the same track got dough
Us cuatro lock flow you dont know
From New York City to Puerto Rico  whoa 
Ay papi tu sabe yo tengo fiebre para ti
You got my fire burnin
Ay papi tu sabe yo tengo fiebre para ti
You got my fire burnin
Uhh uhh
Whats goin on black  Goin platinum and beyond that
Layin down the format sippin on that Cognac
Where the Don at
Im at Hollis with the kings payin homage to the things
They accomplished in they teens and I never stop throwin them flings
Control of the game Im right here over the rain
A human pot of gold I already had a lot of flow
Ready to rock steady with Run and make a lot of dough
You might tell from the way I talk
That sucker MCs is who I stalk
Create in a rhyme that is in formation
Or why I made such a rap creation
That is bound to be reknowned
Within this city as a funky sound
And to those that try to put me down
My DJ has jams by the pound  cmon lets go 


Skaggs Nit
Aiyyo I rolled up in the spot that I rolled up
My ice glitter like hold up
All the chickens like Look at Bo he done growed up
Thinks he the bomb bet his beeper stay blowed up
So much frost on my wrist look my fist froze up
A photographer is tryin to get a little close up
Why cause Im a star now  Buy out the bar now
Or I press one button start up my car now
I heard that you wanna spar now so baby its on
I spit flows rip shows til the day that Im gone
And this day I hit em off Ill have America sewn
Rich plat rims chrome spin    to your dome
I entered your home lick you down strictly to bone
The hit that Im on got Spanish mamis singin my song
