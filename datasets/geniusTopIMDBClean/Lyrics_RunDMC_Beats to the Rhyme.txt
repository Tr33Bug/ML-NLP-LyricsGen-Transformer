DJs and MCs coming up next is the one and only
Incredible Jam Master
Yo back up off the ropes punk
Beats to the rhyme of the rhyme I just made
Party at the jammie til lights the night fade
Trooping for the feature we all get paid
So lets go
Yo D thats me the King the MC
Rhyme get mine on the top
Can another MC ever  with me  Hell no 
Its like the A the B to the C
Its easier than  1 2 3 
Hes Jam Master Jay Im DMC 
So hit it Run
Its time for we to cease  So what 
So rhymers speak your peace
Why Cause you cant touch  Jam Master Jay 
Cause hes number  1 2 3 4 hit it 
Lets dance  to the rhythm the rhyme the cold flow
Chance that I gave em is done I told yo
For these routines like 1983
Its just a little reminder
So those suckas is kinder
A little message from  RunDMC 
Cuts for days will amaze and maze
But will make you sad to tan all the dance aways
Got the mic the man the master plan
But the ram the jam
Know I am  Goddamn
Spins he wins clocking endless ends
To his friends he lends lotta joy he sends
Jay lose today this is what I say
Dick in your mouth all day 


My beats were played and laid rhymes made
Jay DJed and I got paid
Made something out of nothing  Yo D thats true 
Yes my brother I would do it for you
I roam in the zone of the microphone
And Im on the throne but Im not alone
Got bones of steel and not of stone
Im known to be prone and make your momma moan
Time for the rhyme so let the stars shine
Shame for the fame and the name combined
Run for the fun but you can gimme your ring
Show I gotta go so now a word from the King
Hardcore rhymes galore giving you more
And like I said before
Beats to the rhyme the name of this jam
D thats me and thats who I am
Rocking on the mic cause you know I can
You gotta understand I dont give a damn
Jay here to play today I must say
Arranged in the way that is AOK
As we wax the tracks all the DJs play
With  dick in your mouth 
A little  dick in your mouth 
A big  dick in your mouth all day
