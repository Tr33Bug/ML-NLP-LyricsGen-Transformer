This is the way the way the way  8X 
Everybody just BOUNCE  cut by Jay  3X 
I open doors take a pause doin tours then I come again
Runll be runnin up in the spot cause I be runnin
Dem seen dis now DJ Runll be comin
And gettin fiendish my tracks are fat and in fact
Its not just a lean dish your soup and salad not valid
I serve a mean dish mean dish
I got my mic in my hand and my plan to come
The official DJ rapper name is DJ Run
All other sucker rappers boy youre just my son
All wet behind the ears I freeze I froze youre numb
PUMP PUMP  I scream on you you talk and talk
PUMP PUMP  Run you round the track then walk it off
So check for me take in a weapon and even steppin
To my foes even those of Joes are always kept in
Seperate rows broken nose from blows ruin your rep
When I pounce all my foes suppose I swing the ep
And just BOUNCE
This is the way the way the way  8X 
Everybody just BOUNCE  cut by Jay  3X 
My name is DMC the one you know
The alltime great Ima steal the show
I put the mic inside my hand
And spread a funky rhythm all across the land
I blow your mind the rhymell flow
I hit you with the rhythm and they give me dough
Im one of a kind I rock your mind
Im stingy with the digits when I rock my rhyme
I bust a vein inside my brain
I came with the name and I claim the fame
Im hard to the core wicked and raw
The rhymes break raw when Im breakin your door
I kick a ill style cause Im stickastill wild
Takea takea chill now cause I got to kill a foul
Foulmouthed sucker knockin out all doubt
Im takin suckers out cause I make a sucker bounce
This is the way the way the way  8X 
Everybody just BOUNCE  cut by Jay  3X 
BOUNCE
I got no time for the climb Im the kind to rhyme
Theres no sign of my mind slippin off the line
And if you find theres a dime I left behind
I come fast for my cash I must rewind
Easy does it Runll do it speakin fluid vocabulary
Vocal we makin em come to it  then I have you very
Often lost in Runll run a boss then
Confuse you lose youre all lost up in the sauce
Then I stir you sir youre all shakin cause Im diesel
Drop hiphop and then POP goes the weasel
Comin and runnin and seekin daily for my kingdom
Takin my lyrics at first they hear it then they sing them
I take a sucker and do em the heads I flew em
First I chew em then I school em and sue em and steppin to em
Is a daily operation I ruin all those Im doin
I pursue em make em boo and come to you and your crew
And just BOUNCE
This is the way the way the way  continue to fade 
Everybody just BOUNCE  cut by Jay  continue to fade
