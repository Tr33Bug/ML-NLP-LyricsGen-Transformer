If I eat a little kid sticks his finger in my plate
I be signing autographs for three months straight
I got jetset women who offer me favors
My face is a thousand lipstick flavors
Need a sip of lemonade Im a slave to my trade
From all these lights my complexion might fade
Secretary overworked by a moneyhungry jerk
Got a letter answer woman wont you freak out on my shirt
Well can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
Can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
Huh echoes
Your ears are clogged your head as hard as a log
My privacy robbed let me do my job
You funny lookin slob eatin sis kebap
Youre the reason why my eyes are on the doorknob
Can you rock it like this I think I rock it like that
But can you rock it like this Homeboy I rock it like that
Im straining not complaining for a casual life
Something normal nothin formal three kids and a wife
Im dying from the spying that youre putting me through
I perspire Im on fire when Im thinking of you
But can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
Well can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
Huh echoes
Can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
But can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
Huh echoes
News reporters invade my borders
If I think it I will say it you might have a recorder
And then UHHOHH the nations in upheaval
Old ladies always looking at me evil
Youre stepping on my heels youre breathing down my neck
Im not Rodney Dangerfield so give me respect


Can you rock it like this II can rock it like that
But can you rock it like this Homeboy I rock it like that
Can you rock it like this Yo I can rock it like that
But can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
HuHuhHuh echoes
What it all adds up to is just one thing
RunDMC is the king of the swing
And if you mess with us youll be a real short liver
You may be big but our bodyguards bigger echoes
Can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
Can you rock it like this I can rock it like that echoes
Can you rock it like this I can rock it like that
Can you rock it like this Homeboy I rock it like that echoes
