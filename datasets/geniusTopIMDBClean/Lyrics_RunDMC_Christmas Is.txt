Ho ho hon when you think on Christmas it be snowin
And people get their equal hit the full one one for growin
Ya knowin were flowin in the ghetto they get nothing
No toys for little boys no curls for girls and turkey stuffing
They laugh they know that half the presents aint thick
You might just wanna ask Yo where my presents Saint Nick
So think a little bout the people minus money
And when you get your dough why dont you show some kindness honey
Go head get fed and spread a little love
Give what you can afford just like The Lord from up above
A quote a note and one you wont believe
Its better to give than to receive
YO  Its Christmas no dissin listen all you listeners
Think of all the prisoners thats in prison during Christmas
Not tryin to bring you down but tryin to put you up on
Landed it on the table so youre able to put your cup on
No snow not a flurry so hurry dont you miss it
Not dissin you but whishin you a very merry Christmas
Give up the dough Give up the dough
Give up the dough on Christmas YO
Give up the dough Give up the dough
Give up the dough  HERE WE GO HERE WE GO
Im from the ghetto now this mean I get
No toys or presents beneath my tree
I wrote my list I made my wish
Is this what Christmas means to me
No snowflakes droppin cant go shoppin
Rhymes Im apoppin to keep the hiphhoppin
Why cant a Santa Pause for the cause
Im gettin mine you gettin yours
Thats how Christmas is supposed to be
A very merry Christmas for everybodyy
Fight poverty give to the needy
Dont be like The Grinch cause The Grinch is greedy
Deck the malls with bows of holly
Tis the season to be jolly
No presents for my tree yet
And I dont even know if any gifts Im gonna get
Happy holidays not like a lotta days
A few here a few there a new year
Season greetings are the reasons for the cheer
If Santa Claus is coming to town
Hope its my chimney hes coming down
On Christmas because Christmas is
On Christmas because Christmas is
HERRRRE WE GO FLOW 
Hahave a very merry merry and hurry
And if youll need a leader Runll be there for your flurry
Blurry sight and write a rhyme for the night
Christmas is the time for giving not for the type
So open your pockets your heart unlock it
Dollars train from Hollis I give it like I clock it
Cold as the weather minus the humidity
Dont mistake harmonies and kindness for timidity
Christmas this must be the time of year
Leggo of your Eggo rather ego me go there
And here my dear so give a kid a beer
Cause every time you give its coming back lets get it clear
Ill be scopin and hopin brothers lend a ear
So have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Yeah thats right Give up the dough
I want my Ninja Turtles I want my bike
I want my Sega Genesis I want my Nintendo
And turn my mommy lights back on  Word up
