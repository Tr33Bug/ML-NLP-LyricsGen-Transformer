It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog oh my God a ill reindeer
But then I was illin cause the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies 12 oclock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he mustve dropped his wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said Santa Claus
A million dollars in it cold hundreds of Gs
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But Id never steal from Santa cause that aint right
So Im going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me
Its Christmas time in Hollis Queens
Moms cookin chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snows on the ground snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryls
But each and every year we bust Christmas carols
Christmas melodies
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it
Its Christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin the hawk is out
And thats what Christmas is all about
The time is now the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer
My names DMC with the mic in my hand
And Im chilling and coolin just like a snowman
So open your eyes lend us an ear
We want to say
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
