Darryl and Joe  KrushGroove 3  Lyrics	Well I rehearsed for the verse and Im number one
Not the best not the worst cause my name is Run
And Im second cause I wreck it that you want to see
An emcee  like D  inside the place  to be 
And have you heard that he is third and his name is Jay
Im Run the Ace
Ds the Deuce
And Jays the Tre
Jam Master Jay cuts
Im the rapper of the year and this the year of the rap
And Im never drinkin beer its champagne at the tap
And Im cold makin money on a regular basis
Pullin out knockin sucker MC faces
Travel round the world with my mind at ease
No Calvin Klein just wearin Lees
Got credit in countries Ive never been
Cause the records I write are in the top ten
The top of the chart is where I stay
But I also chill around the way
In Hollis Queeens is where I stop
On the streets with the beats is where I walk
When I perform many hearts I warm
Im better known as the Quiet Storm
I dont talk too much but I got beef
When I kill MCs I cause grief
Devastating mic control is my main goal
My name is Darryl and his name is  Joe 
The Master of music his name is Jay
Leave us alone and let us play
We give it up and turn it loose
Were not like Dr Seuss or Mother Goose
Sucker MCs like punks who are picking flowers
Go for yours WE WENT FOR OURS
Jam Master Jay cuts
Start at 3 end at 6
Jam Master Jay is on the mix
For all the young ladies
And all the chicks
We got all of the girls
On our tips
Dont buy gold lighters
Only Bics
Rock all microphones
Just for kicks
Sucker MCs I will be snuffin
In my pocket Ill keep on stuffin
When I say Ill beat em up I wont be bluffin
They cant beef cause that aint nothin
But it dont matter my pocket gets  fatter 
I got more hats than the  Mad Hatter 
Well Im the rapper with the mic drive a Caddy not a bike
Drop a rhyme in your face and youll damn sure like
Hes an MC with the rhyme know the day and the time
Never ever goin low cause he only climb
And Jays the DJ with the  cut  move your arm  and your butt
So D take the mic huh hah
Say what  I will not stop I will not quit
Because some at the top but Im on the tip
Thats as high on the top as you can get
And you best believe Ill be on it
So before you decide to try me out
Im gonna let you all know what Im all about
Im a fresh MC whos on his way
To be an MC with the most to say
And to all those out there that dont know me
I go by the name of D M C
In the place to be I will MC
The Master of the Ceremony cause its easy to D
Control of the mic is so devastating
That all other rappers you will soon be hating
No matter what race creed or color
When we perform things dont  get duller 
Jam Master Jay cuts for the rest of the song
