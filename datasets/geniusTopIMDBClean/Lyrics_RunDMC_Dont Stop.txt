As I proceed indeed to take the lead with speed
All the suckersll back off and fall
But this is the hype I like and the type of mic
You wanna fight  Just gimme a call
Im going to breeze
past the other MCs
And Ds rhymesll flow like water
The wind the rain the hurricane its all the same
With rhymes in order
And yo my name is Run and yeah Im all that
Slap back the KING of the daddy macks
But that aint the news I choose to tell
I gotta use the cruise that bruises well
For the grime you slime you try to diss mine
I put your head to bed cause its bedtime
I knock out your teeth beneath your gums
Now youre mumblin  you bum
Turn out the lights Run   Picture punks playin me close
When Im hard as hell and thats all labelled SUCKERS
Waitin for the King of Swing to bring
Beats to the Rhyme and yeah Im runnin things
Now thats the name of the phrase
So dont be amazed at the ways my rhyme displays
You gotta make the best of what you got to get to the top
In hiphop you gotta diggy diggy dont STOP
musical interlude 
The longest yardest artist hittin hardest smartest
Professor compressor impressor to the lesser
Lowlife  of the mic
I come CORRECT  You surely right 
The atmosphere is clear when I appear
Here to wax and tax an MC for mere pennies
And if any wanna get with D
I crash and bash and smash his ass for free
Black man  Originating creating a beat
I educate and straight from off the streets
HARD like a man was born to be
It just just happened in rap I was born to be
KING yeah me the king of the rock
So lets rock the spot and diggy dont STOP
musical interlude 
Funky lyrics that you hear
AS WE RELEASE THE MASTERPIECE THE MUSIC WILL CEASE
and Ill put up the peace sign
And I roll with soul and reach my goal the story is told
Ds bold and suckersll fold
And Im Run my son the fun has just begun
And some are slum and make em sell til
Crumbles crumb they hum those fools will come
And none have never done Run Jay
DMC the king is me and I be
The voice of black community
So be the unity inside of me and we
Will all agree about this  dont STOP
music to fade
