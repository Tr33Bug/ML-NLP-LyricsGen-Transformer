Reporters clock producers jock
They wanna be down with the King
Down with the king for years about ten of em
Recruiting suckers mackin mic and makin men of em
Tears and fears for my peers they rippin
You think that it is it is if not it isnt
Race for the border my daughter cause beats youre bangin out
Jeeps rockin beats in the streets when theres time for hangin out
Gather or rather form a circle around a loud
Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because hes runnin off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin to play a nigga out
Nope shut him down the king with a crown
Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down
Down with the king
The king down with the king 
The king
Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme Im about to say
The rhyme was meeca and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts wearing Godfather hats
Its okay to parlay to forte better
Tell em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and Ill wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon now your dumb ass is leakin
CL and Run DMC so rush it
Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma no shoelaces
And Im
Down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King


Im takin the tours Im wreckin the land
I keep it hardcore because its dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not meant for a ho like a slow jam check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only GOD could be a king to me
And if the GOD be in me then the king I be
The microphone is branded when its handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw
Down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King
Im the man you see in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic a full swinger
The P to the R not an RB singer
The R to the UNDMCn
The fly human beings tonight I hold the key and
Flowin with the funk track here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin
Had skins yawning
Mecca  yo  you want the mecca  yo 
Ill make a funky beat so we can blow check it out
Pete Rocks the beat knock put you in a headlock
And now all the outty out flock is down with the king
Down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King
Down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King down with the king the king down with the king
The King Down with the
The King Down with the
The King Down with the
The King Down with the
The King Down with the king
