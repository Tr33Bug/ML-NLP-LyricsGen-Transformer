Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
I seen you jockin JC cause he got a Mercedes
And you know about his ladies and all his babies
You just wanna ride and get inside
And run around town like Bonnie and Clyde
But see the moves youre makin the route youre takin
Will lead to heartbreakin and Im not mistaken
You like his money youll be his honey
Get the truth no excuse youre a great big dummy dumb girl
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb  Dumb girl 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
I wish I knew why a girl like you
Wants to do all the things that you do
I know you want a man but you should understand
That JC aint D you shouldnt be his fan
Youre not just fine youre out of your mind
And I wrote this rhyme just for your kind
Dont be misled remember what I said
The rhymes of rappers surely knock some sense in your head dumb girl
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb  Dumb girl 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb  Now 
Now youre the flyest girl in the whole school
But they dont call you fly they call you fool
Because you dont go to class you will not pass
You like to go but you should slow because youre goin too fast
And I can tell that youre dumb when you walk in the place
Walkin round with your thumb cold stuck in your face
Always sinnin never winnin cause youre last in the race
You get high and tell a lie and think that makes you the ace dumb girl
Stupid the girl is
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Now youre a stupid sex fiend with no will power  Power 
Had four guys in the bathroom at your last baby shower
All the guys call you fast  Fast  but I call you slow  Slow 
Always sniffin or givin  Givin  somebody a blow  Blow 
Givin every guy a try  Try  at the wink of an eye  Eye 
Theres somethin that youre missin that money cant buy  Buy 
When it comes to love youre even hated by Cupid  Cupid 
Youre  Silly  dilly  Dumb  and youre just plain stupid dumb girl
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb  Stupid  dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb  Dumb girl 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
The girl is
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
I hope you to listen to the words that I speak
Im not playin what Im sayin can never be weak
You should use your brain but you dont have one
And when it comes to sense you dont have none
Yo yo you should know where Im comin from
But youre just dumb diddy dumb diddydiddy dumbdumb dumb girl
Dumb dumb dumb dumb  Dumb with a capital D  dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb  Dumb girl 
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb  Stupid as can be breakdown 
Dumb
The girl is
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb  Dumb girl
