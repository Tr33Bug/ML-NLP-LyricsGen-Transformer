GHOSTBUSTERS
I aint afraid of no ghosts  3X 
GHOSTBUSTERS
Something strange goin on
Somethings wrong
Gloom in the room
Outside is the storm
All alone in the crib
Watchin the tube
Yoooo is that what I think
Did I see somethin move
Chill down your spine
Your heart fills with fright
Not filled by the things
That GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT
They walk through the walls
With no time to stall
You call the GHOSTBUSTERS
Well thats who you call

And you know you can trust us
So dont get nervous cause at your service

GHOSTBUSTERS
Aight aight aight
I remember the time I visited the grave
My life on the line only my life to save
All by myself with no one around
Did not understand a hand comin out the ground
I knew it wasnt mine it was somebody else
But I didnt care G I just screamed for HELP
Then  GHOSTBUSTERS  had strapped to their back
Screamin  GHOSTBUSTERS  those busters attacked
We are your friendly neighborhood ghostbusters
Thats what they said to me
We are the busters of any GHOST
GHOSTBUSTERS
I aintI aintI aint
I aint afraid of no ghosts
GHOSTBUSTERS
I aintI aintI aint
I aint afraid of no ghosts
Howling haunting
Scaring screaming
Ghostly ghosts
Ghouling demons
Monsters spooks
Werewolves and devils
All those things
on the same level
Nightmares  bad dreams  cannot be beat
It takes a brave man  to stand in defeat 
Must be the bravest  yo the bravest and most 
You must be able to say I aint afarid of no ghosts
A good sense of humor is important to have
When a ghost tries to scare you  ha dont make me laugh 
They be dustin off ghosts like true ghostdusters
Go go go go ghoooooosstbusters
GHOSTBUSTERS
Busters busters
One time in the house
Peace to everybody out there
We love ya peace
I AINT AFRAID OF NO GHOSTS
