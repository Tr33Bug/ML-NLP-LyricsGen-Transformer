One for the treble two for the bass
Come on Jam Master lets rock the place
Im a dominator in my field
And when it comes to rap other rappers yield
Cause when it comes to rap Im the epitome
The rappers idol and my title is Kool Moe Dee
They call me iller than iller
Theres no one chiller
Its not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
One def rapper cold know I can hang
Im Run from RunDMC like Kool from Kool  the Gang
Well Im one of the chosen few
So when you need that lift just to get you through
All you have to do is say Special K
And help is on the way
Well Im DMC in the place to be
And the place to be is with DMC
And by the time Im through you will agree
No other emcees rock the house like me
Well Im the coolest of the cool they call me Moe Dee
It aint another rapper whos as bad as me
I got a highpowered voice Im the party peoples choice
I got so many rhymes you gotta take invoice
Now party people Im so happy I dont know what to do
Cause Im the emcee with the rock cold down with the crew
Rhyme from Africa to France and then to Kalamazoo
And every place that I play I hear a Yeah and a Woo
Well I know that when a party is packed
You need a guide to show you when and where to react
You need a motivator  that means youll need me
Special K huh from the Treacherous Three
DMC thats who I am
I love to perform but Im not a ham
My mother said Do it I said Yes maam
And I can do it cause I know I can
Well dont touch that dial  just sit tight
If you liked that battle huh that was light
I know youre gonna love this next act
Cause well have Shannon when we get back
Graffiti Rock
