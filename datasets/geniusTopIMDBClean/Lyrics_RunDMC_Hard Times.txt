Hard times spreading just like the flu
Watch out homeboy dont let it catch you
Pppprices go up dont let your pocket go down
When you got short money youre stuck on the ground
Turn around get ready keep your eye on the clock
And be on point for the future shock
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times are coming to your town
So stay alert dont let them get you down
They tell you times are tough you hear that times are hard
But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card
Hard times got our pockets all in chains
Ill tell you what homeboy it dont have my brain
All day I have to work at my peak
Because I need that dollar every day of the week
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times can take you on a natural trip
So keep your balance and dont you slip
Hard times is nothing new on me
Im gonna use my strong mentality
Like the cream of the crop like the crop of the cream
Bbbbeating hard times that is my theme
Hard times in life hard times in death
Im gonna keep on fighting to my very last breath
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
