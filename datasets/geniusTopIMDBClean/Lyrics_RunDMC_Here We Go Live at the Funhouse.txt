Rhymes that youve never even heard before
Now if you say you heard my rhyme we gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the motherfuckers up last night
Kick off your shoes relax your feet
Party on down to the DJ Run beat
The beat to get you up and get you outta your seat
Make you boogie to this  party  cause you know its unique
Wait a tiny minute dont break on me
My rhymes come faster as the DJ Cheese
The DJ cuts the record for the valley below
Then I boogie your ass til its time to go
And when its time to go GIRLS takin you home
So straighten your dress up bout your hair use a comb
Well Im the microphone master super rhyme maker
I get def as the others get faker
Its me DMC in the place to be
And I still got the same old harmony
Im the DevaSTATIN Mic Controller
The word wizard and the chief rock HOLDER
Bad bboy made for the bgirls
Rock rulin rhymes as the turntable twirls
Supreme leader was born to talk
And over any corded rap king Ill exalt  
Im from Hollis Queens and the games we play
See these games most everyday
People ridin round town think hot rods
Get paid real well dont have jobs
Weve got pickpockets thieves gamblin man
Bettin twenty to one right against your friend
Weve got em all out there doin their best
Play slick games and avoid arrest
Now the games of life are really fun
But you had to play the game until the game is done
So play on
to the break of dawn
As we rock yall on to the early morn
Hes JAM MASTER JAY the big beat blaster
HE gets better cause he know HE HAS TO

And only practice MAKES A REAL JAM MASTER

Cuttin and scratchin ARE THE ASPECTS OF HIS GAME
So check out the Master as he cuts THESE JAMS
Then look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count one two three
Jam Master Jay  Run DMC
