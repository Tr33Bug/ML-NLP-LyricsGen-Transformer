Born to rock around the clock
You cant say Im not
And in case you forgot
Im the king of rock
Im the devastating mic controller DMC
And cant nobody mess around with me
Im the king of rock rap and of rhyme
I deal what I feel and it feels fine
If the sound from the Jay then I wont play
Around with sound put down for the rhymes I say
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together lets rock
Hit it Run
You just watch your clock while I rock your spot
Im better known to the world as the king of rock
I like to speak my piece when Im on the mic
Im the best or at least Im the one you like
And when I serve you deserve to hear what I say
I throw a curve he got the nerve to make a triple play
Now how devastating can an MC be
My name is Darryl but you can call me D
Hit it Run
Its called gangsta hard rock nonstop hiphop
And its headed for the top by the rhymes I pop
For every race place color country county or creed
And all of the places that I emceed
Bboy badness to the highest degree
And you cant be a boy unless you be D
You cant bust a cherry or crush a grape
And if you aint got this tape youre in bad shape
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together lets  Rock 
Do you really believe whats going on
I was conceived and I was born
I once was lost but now Im found
Tell your bunch Im boss I run this town
I leave all suckers in the dust
Those dumb motherfuckers cant mess with us
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together lets rock
Hit it Run
I was straight from the start performing art
Climbing up the chart while others fall apart
The three outlaws in the music trade
We wont rob but our job is to get paid  Paid 
Cause Run has fun if Jay will play
As I add one more rhyme to say
Now how devastating can an MC be
My name is Darryl but you can call me D
Hit it Run
I was born son of Byford brother of Al
Bannahs my mamma and Runs my pal
Its McDaniels not McDonalds
These rhymes are Darryls the burgers are  Ronalds 
I ran down my family tree
My mother my father my brother and D
RunDMC and Jam Master Jay
