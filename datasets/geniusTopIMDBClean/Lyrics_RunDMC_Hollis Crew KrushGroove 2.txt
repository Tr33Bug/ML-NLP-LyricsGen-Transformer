Hollis Crew  KrushGroove 2  LyricsSucker MCs who did not learn
If you dont this time we shall return
The beat is big its kind of large
And when were on the mic were in charge
Its like that yall  that yall  like that yall  that yall 
Like thatathathat alike that yall  that yall 
Cool chief rocker I dont drink vodka
But keep a microphone inside my locker
Go to school everyday on the side makin pay
Cause Im rockin on the mic until the break of day
And now the things I do make me a star
And you could be too if you know who you are
Just put your mind to it youll go real far
Like a pedal to the metal when youre drivin a car
Liggyliggyliggylisten to the things that I say
Because its not routine its the way I play
Just come out my mouth all time of the day
And then I must have time to give it away
Hey they used to call me Easy D
Cause I rapped on the mic so easily
But now they call me DMC
Hes  the Emcee of the party
The Ds for doin it all of the time
The Ms for the rhymes that are all mine
The Cs for cool cool as can be
And why you wear those glasses  So I can see
Huhhuh
Got rhymes so def rhymes rhymes galore
Rhymes that you never even heard before
Now if you say you heard my rhymes were gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the superdef rhymes last night
Microphone master super rhyme maker
I get def as the others get faker
Its me DMC in the place to be
And I still got the same old harmony
Im the devastatin miccontroller
The word wizard and the chief rock roller
Bad bboy made for the bgirls
Rock ruler rhymes as the turntable twirls
Supreme being who was born to talk
And over sucker MCs all day I walk
A few years ago my name was Joe
And then I went to a party cold stole the show
Stole it as sure as birds have wings
Now theyre callin me DJ Running Things
Got Kurtis Blow down with the two
And my man Larry Lah makes beats for you
Keepin up the funky beat is the Hollis Crew
So Dee take the mic cause you know Im through
In case you wonder what all this means
Were funky fresh from Hollis Queens
Run and Kurt both down with me
And thats the way its meant to be
Im the microphone master DMC
Devastatin miccontroller personality
And to the sucker MCs who did not learn
If you dont this time we shall return
