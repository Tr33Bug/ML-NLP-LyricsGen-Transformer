Back back back with the boom so give a nigga room
Came with the fame with my name came a tune
The King of Rock there is none higher
God  with Madonna not melodic like Mariah
Carey when Larry put me in his Caddy I made my album
I rock the funky beat like Marky Mark be rockin Calvin
Kleins no friend of mine I told you Pryor
Richard switch it all around now you admire
My Adidas was a hit in eightysix it made me dollars
Stompin straight through Compton niggas there was screamin HOLLIS
Back to the top youre bout to get dropped
Go for what you know or ride the bo and get stopped
My man Darryl Mack dressed in all black
I pass the mic to D  and DMCll pass it back 
Rappers wont be dissin after this rap song
Cause they sing like Rodney King Cant we all just get along
Chorus
From a harder core Im kickin the raw
I wreck it on tour Im breakin your jaw
This is what RunDMCll be about yall
I make the party people want to scream and shout yall
Im just a bboy so watch me destroy
You best believe in youre receivin DMC boy
I used to explode I never let go
I let the tec go back because I said so
Yeah Im a hoodlum but Im a good one
So punks gunnin for my run I wish they would come
So back up Mr Softy cause youre not hard
Youre never comin off because I got God
Just   and get a beat down
Never weak kid I come up with more street sounds
Rhymes galore and soarin cross the floor an
Some more is pourin knockin down your door an
Chorus
Cmon and jump to the rhythm I give em is what I give em
When I get em I just hit em and split em
And when I split em lit em up like a bulb in the dark
I made you blink you figure out cause I know youre the mark
I gotta lotta what I gotta thatll be what I got
So step to me or DMC and itll be in your heart
Now ease up back off the bozack you know that you bite
You think youre doin me or D Nigga please  what 
Chorus
