The microphone master DMC
Cause one two three four casualties
Youll be praisin D down on your knees
Cause Im poppin and droppin stoppin all MCs
Connect eject and collect respect
Get down to the sound cause I come correct
So when I write dont bite and I might check
And if I find your behind Ill break your neck
Its the world rhymin rapper ready to have fun
Youll reason with the record cause its made by Run
Its def you was left in a total stun
So bust a move while I prove whos number one
Got quality and skill both beyond belief
Do I steal Be for real Im not a thief
Dictator and hater of those that beef
Thats right I can fight and Im the chief
People in the place dont put D down
Im the microphone master the best around
Theres not too many of my type
And all rap titles I will swipe
Youll see me talkin to a girl
A sweet young thing with Jheri curls
I never ever wore a braid
Got the peasiest hair and still get paid
Well Im dropping MCs with just one punch
Cause its the baddest on the booth so call me Captain Crunch
Slayin MCs make em walk the plank
And whats next Start the decks while I count my bank
And Im the wizard of words the ruler of rap
Not soft not a sucka could never be a sap
You might get jacked cause you talk crap
When I bust my rap they all step back
Im paid on stage Runs on my left
On his right on the mic I recite Im def
Because every performer is only a goner
Keep all sissy soft suckas off my corner
Is it is it isis it live
Is it is it isis it live
Live
Isisis it live
Is it is it live
Is it live
Cause Darryl Mac will do things like that
The sophisticated sound not soft or sour
Its servin you suckas sellin dreams in the shower
Its rockin this party hour hour after hour
If a girly tried to diss this  Whats up with that 
I wont allow her
Cool chief rapper I see a girl I tap her
Then I take her on the floor she dont dance I slap her
The girl starts to cry and the crowd asks me why
If Run says Dance you do or die
