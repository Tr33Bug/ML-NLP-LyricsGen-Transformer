Its Like That  Original  LyricsAnd it goes a little something like this
Unemployment at a record high
People coming people going people born to die
Dont ask me because I dont know why
But its like that and thats the way it is
People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car train bus or feet
I said you got to work hard you want to compete
Its like that and thats the way it is
Huh
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups your downs your highs and your lows
Wont you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes
Its like that and thats the way it is
Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
Id rather stay young go out and play
Its like that and thats the way it is
Huh
Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity
Its like that and thats the way it is
Disillusion is the word
Thats used by me when Im not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
Its like that and thats the way it is
Huh
You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
Its like that  what  and thats the way it is

You should have gone to school you couldve learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time youre crying that youre underpaid
Its like that and thats the way it is
You know its like that and thats the way it is
Because its like that and thats the way it is
You know its like that and thats the way it is
Because its like
