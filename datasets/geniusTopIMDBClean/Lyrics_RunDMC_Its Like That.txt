Unemployment at a record high
People coming people going people born to die
Dont ask me because I dont know why
But its like that and thats the way it is
People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car train bus or feet
I said you got to work hard you want to compete
Its like that and thats the way it is
Huh
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups your downs your highs and your lows
Wont you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes
Its like that and thats the way it is
Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
Id rather stay young go out and play
Its like that and thats the way it is
Huh
Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity
Its like that and thats the way it is
Disillusion is the word
Thats used by me when Im not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
Its like that and thats the way it is
Huh
You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
Its like that  what  and thats the way it is
You should have gone to school you couldve learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time youre crying that youre underpaid
Its like that  what  and thats the way it is
Huh
One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy give this a thought
The next time someones teaching why dont you get taught
Its like that  what  and thats the way it is
If you really think about it times arent that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying you wont be sad
Its like that  what  and thats the way it is
Huh
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train drive to school or the church
Its like that and thats the way it is
Heres another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool whos prejudiced
Because were all written down on the same list
Its like that  what  and thats the way it is
Huh
You know its like that and thats the way it is
Because its like that and thats the way it is
Repeat these lines til fade
