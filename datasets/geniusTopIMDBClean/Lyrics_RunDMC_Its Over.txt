Uhhuh huh uhhuh ahhhaa ahhhaa see
When yall heard that all Im doin is laughin at all yall niggas
Thats been frontin on my mans and them man
These niggas started this shit man
When it comes to the shows that I rock and the flows that I drop
Yall know Run kills the mic
Cant forget about the Olds that I got and the Rolls in the spot
Yall know I aint stealed it right
How you gonna take a old song been around so long
So So Def done made it tight
Done went from a deejay to a emcee
To the REV like overnight
Everybody lookin players get shook when
Rev Run walk up in the spot
Even all the crooks that been livin outta Brooklyn
Just cant help but point a lot
Everywhere I go now people say Oh wow
Cause they know how I get
It dont matter if its Motown all the way to yo town
You cant slow down my hits
Cant slow it down man Think about this From 1983 to 2000 Its 2001 and these niggas still on the run Yall niggas just crazy yall out here tryin to front like they aint the reason you went and bought a pair of shelltoe The fuck is wrong witchall
People wanna hurt Rev Run say cause I got dough
That I must be a type of fraud
But you know the thing thats funny this garden aint money
Then how rich is the lawn
Went got JD made me crazy
Play me up in the club
Got a brand new Mercedes for my lady
But see me Im older
To the Bentley and all that come out the garage
On the side of a grand prestigious home
Yall ask if Im blessed by God player what you thought
What Rev you seen on chrome

If you had love back in the day  Thats right 
Just raised up my kicks and I changed what I spit
And returned as the Run yall love today  Yeah 
I pick the mic back up came right back up
To the top where Im posed to be  Posed to be 
And when the track light up yall can back right up
Yall players too close to me
You know what I used to like The way my man used to come on stage and grab the mic And just throw the damn stand across the stage man Then he used to tell his man like Yo D come right here in the middle of the stage grab yo shit and say what you gotta say And you know what D used to say He used to say Party people Your dreams have now been fulfilled get out your seats and lets get ill Thats right yall were not just rough we more than tough And when it comes to shit like this ha we got enough Yknahmean You know who the fuck I am you know my name you know my game Its So So Def RunDMC Biatch
