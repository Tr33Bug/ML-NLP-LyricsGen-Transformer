They really hawk but we just walk because we have no time
And in the city its a pity cause we just cant hide
Tinted windows dont mean nothin they know whos inside

When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time
Im not singin phone keep ringin cause I make up a rhyme
Im not braggin people naggin cause they think Im a star
Always tearin what Im wearin I think theyre goin too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her now shes jockin Jay
I aint lyin girls be cryin cause Im on TV
They even bother my poor father cause hes down with me
