Im the king of rock there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
To burn my kingdom you must use fire
I wont stop rockin till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers cant stand us but give us respect
They called us hip were gettin iller
Theres no one chiller
Its not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper I know I can hang
Im Run from RunDMC like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You cant touch me with a tenfoot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when were on the tape were fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person were a verbal treat
Its me and DMC Jay wheres the beat
Now were the baddest of the bad the coolest of the cool
Im DMC I rock and roll Im DJ Run I rock and rule
Its not a Trick or Treat and its not a April Fool
Its all brand new never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you cant comprehend
When your mind wont wiggle and your knees wont bend
Music aint nothin but a peoples jam
Its DJ Run DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages held many mics
Take airplane flights at huge heights
So all you sucker MCs you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high Im pulling down rees
Got a song so strong its knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe its RunDMCs
I am from around the way
And Run goes to school every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay HEY
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be meek
So dont try to diss me try to be my friend
Cause if you do youll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say shall set a trend
Because a devastating rap is what we send
Every jam we play we break two needles
Theres three of us but were not the Beatles
My name is Darryl you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack or you can call him DMC
People always ask DMC what does it mean
Ds for never dirty MC for mostly clean
Like we said before we rock hardcore
Im DJ Run I can scratch Im DMC I can draw
And now we got the knack  to attract
Our rhymes an aphrodisiac
Well reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock give it all we got
To be MCs we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
Were cool cool cats its like that
Thats the way it is so stay the hell back
Were causin hard times for sucker MCs
Cause they dont make no songs like these
PERIOD
