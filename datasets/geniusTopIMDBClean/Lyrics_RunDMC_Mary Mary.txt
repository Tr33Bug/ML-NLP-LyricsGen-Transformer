Mary Mary Why ya buggin
Mary Mary I need ya huggin
Had a fly girl Flo called her honey
Next thing she spent up all my money
Had me in debt you and your girls dizzy
Stopped movin crack but youre still gettin pissy
You could call me everyday God sent
Like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent
I spend and I spend and you spent and you spent
Now my house with a mouse is a roach with a tent
Mary Mary Why ya buggin
Mary Mary I need ya huggin
MaryMaryMary you cold thumb suckin
Lookin for you but you keep duckin
I wanna find you I gotta tell you somethin
So just be quiet and dont say  Nuttin

Supposed to be with me but not youre frontin
We started out new you used to be true
Now youre buggin whats wrong with you
Mary Mary Why ya buggin

Now This girl Mary I knew so well
I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never failed
Clubs and the pubs is where she dwelled 
Story about Mary was well to tell
She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent a night locked in a cell
I knew Mary well cause she Raising Hell


Mary Mary Why ya buggin
Mary Mary I need ya huggin
Its not Mary who was quite contrary
Talkin bout Mary who was always in a hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if shes crazy and Ill say very
Livin in a house thats out on the prairie
I worry about Mary cause Mary is scary
Mary Mary Why ya buggin
Mary Mary I need ya huggin
Mary Mary Why ya buggin
Mary Mary I need ya huggin
Mary Mary Why ya buggin
