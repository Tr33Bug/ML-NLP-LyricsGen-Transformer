My Adidas walk through concert doors
And roam all over coliseum floors
I stepped on stage at Live Aid
All the people gave and the poor got paid
And out of speakers I did speak
I wore my sneakers but Im not a sneak
My Adidas touch the sand of a foreign land
With mic in hand I cold took command
My Adidas and me close as can be
We make a mean team my Adidas and me
We get around together were down forever
And we wont be mad when caught in bad weather
My Adidas
Uh 
My Adidas
Uh 
Yo whats up
My Adidas standin on two fifth street
Funky fresh and yes cold on my feet
With no shoestring in em I did not win em
I bought em off the ave with the black Lee denim
I like to sport em thats why I brought em
A sucker tried to steal em so I caught em and I fought em
And I walk down the street and bop to the beat
With Lee on my legs and Adidas on my feet
And so now Im just standin here shootin the gip
Me and D and my Adidas standing on two fifth
My Adidas
My Adidas
Now me and my Adidas do the illest things
We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
We slay all suckers who perpetrate
And lay down law from state to state
We travel on gravel dirt road or street
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat
On stage front page every show I go
Its Adidas on my feet high top or low
My Adidas
My Adidas
What up what up what up
Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare
Myself homeboy got fifty pair
Got blue and black cause I likes to chill
And yellow and green when its time to get ill
Got a pair that I wear when Im playin ball
With the heel inside make me ten feet tall
My Adidas only bring good news
And they are not used as felon shoes
Theyre black and white white with black stripes
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of a famous university
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen
Hollywood knows were good if you know what I mean
We started in the alley now we chill in Cali
And I wont trade my Adidas for no  beat up Ballys
My Adidas
