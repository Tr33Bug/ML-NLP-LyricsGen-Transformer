Never let a punk get away with murder
Gun shots gun shots all you hearda
Whats up Whats up Whats the word up
Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
Ooh whatcha gonna do  4X 
A vain from my brain means Im causin em pain
Comin rough with the stuff thats just a part of the game
The rhymes have been hard since the start of the jam
So Imma pull my jammy out and Imma murder the man
Bust a rap like a cap put a hole in your soul
Take the trigger then you figured that Im losin control
I go loco with the vocals yo goes the chokehold
And I broke those pros with the dope flows
I slow rolls NO I dont smoke those
Leave the blunts for the punks in front rows
I said mine headline or deadline
You see redline here comes your bedtime
I lay it down lay it low
Now Im off and runnin on some new rhyme flow
I flex break necks bust tecs mic checks son
Fill you full of lead and now get ready for the next one
Never let a punk get away with murder
Gun shots gun shots all you hearda
Whats up Whats up Whats the word up
Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
Ooh whatcha gonna do  4X 
Now mic check and respect come correct and I can protect
You never knew  DJ who  DJ Runll wreck
Hard God may be dope you never knew me nope
Where you been your hand is sendin DOWN can you really cope
Forever makin and breakin it and cold wreckin it
As for my title its vital youre never TAKIN it
I throw a stand across the stage and youll get BUCKED down
Like KrisOne said I fly a head you better Duck Down
I sold good and then plenty like  Charlie said
Like Mike I glove it you love it and now its for my bread
Its goin down on the mound watch a nigga pitch
Bang your thang and hang your damn NECKS now you gettin it
I see them go and come cause what they pumpin weak
And now Im flippin the script and they can hardly speak
I buck a nut then run amuck all on a sucker COOL
Now whatcha gonna do Whatcha gonna do
Never let a punk get away with murder
Gun shots gun shots all you hearda
Whats up Whats up Whats the word up
Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
Ooh whatcha gonna do  4X 
Never let a punk get away with murder
Gun shots gun shots all you hearda
Whats up Whats up Whats the word up
Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
Ooh whatcha gonna do  4X 
Never let a punk get away with murder
Gun shots gun shots all you hearda
