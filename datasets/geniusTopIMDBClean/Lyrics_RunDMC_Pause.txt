Next time you think of doin a crime
Pause and remember this rhyme
Pause for the cause cause broken laws
Are just like broken jaws
They take a long time to heal
Im for real and I know the deal
Look it over investigate
Evaluate think
Life is wrong and full of flaws
Before you break laws just pause
I think that worked man  4X 
Pause
Yeah pause this beat is dope D

Well if its dope I hope its not crack
Or coke or nuttin like somethin you EVER smoke
And if they offer you some say NO
Or pause
The reason I wrote this rhyme is not to climb
But just to tell all mankind
That the use and abuse of drugs  will what
Will blow your mind
Like dough makes bread it goes straight to your head
Youre misled and then youre dead
Now thats not fly when you die
On a high
Like a trip oooh you make me sick
Ill lookin like doo doo on a stick
You dont have to be a vic
Life is like a flick so pause
Pause ppause pause pppause

And hand this to the one man band
Now pause now pause

Now check out the dance that I display
Its called the pause
A new thing on the dancefloor
First you move then you stop
Combine the hustle foxtrot pop and lock
Put em all together why because
Its called the pause
Slammin the dance is slammin
Pause the people are jammin
Stop again back to the groove
I show you how to move
Pause
Its simple just like stop and go
You can pause on the fast or slow
Participate wont you all get down
Heres a solo from my homeboy Stanley Brown
Ahh yeah I like this RB shit
