Now Peter Piper picked peppers but Run rocked rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down thats his hard time
Jack B Nimble was nimble and he was quick
But Jam Master cut faster Jacks on Jays dick
Now Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip Van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice chilling somewhere in Wonderland
Jacks serving Jill a bucket in his hand
And Jam Master Jays making all that sound
The turntables might wobble but they dont fall down
Now Dr Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing
But Jam Masters getting loose and DMCs the king
Cause hes adult entertainer child educator
Jam Master Jay king of the crossfader
Hes the better of the best best believe hes the baddest
Perfect timing when Im climbing Im a rhyming apparatus
Lot of guts when he cuts girls move their butts
His name is Jay hear the play he must be nuts
And on the mix real quick and Id like to say
Hes not Flash but hes fast and his name is Jay
It it goes a one two three and
Jays like King Midas as I was told
Everything that he touch turn to gold
Hes the greatest of the greater get it straight hes great
Playing fame cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say
God damn that DJ made my day
Like the butcher the baker the candlestick maker
Hes a maker a breaker and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were kids he would be due
Not lying yall hes the best I know
And if I lie my nose will grow
Like a little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story go
Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs
Hes a big bad wolf and youre the three pigs
Hes a big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good
There it is
Were RunDMC got a beef to settle
Ds not Hansel hes not Gretel
Jays a winner not a beginner
His pocket gets fat others get thinner
Jjjjj jump on Jay like cow jumps moon
People chase Jay like dish and spoon
And like all fairy tales end
Youll see Jay again my friend huh
