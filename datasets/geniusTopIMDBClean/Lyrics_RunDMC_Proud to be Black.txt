Listen party people heres a serious song
Its right not wrong I should say right on
I gotta tell you somethin that you all should know
Its not a mystery its history and heres how it go
Now Harriet Tubman was born a slave
She was a tiny Black woman but she was brave
She was livin to be givin theres a lot that she gave
Theres not a slave in this day and age Im proud to be
Black goddamn Im tired my man
Dont worry bout what color I am
Because Ill show you how ill this man can act
It could never be fiction cause it is all fact
And if you get in my way I will not turn back
Im proud of my name my name is Darryl Mack
Im Black and Im proud and Ill say it out loud
Ill share my story with the whole crowd uh
You know Im proud to be Black yall
And thats a fact yall
And if you try to take whats mine Ill take it back yall
Its like that
DJ Run and Im running things
You can hear it loud and clear like when the school bell rings
Like Martin Luther King I will do my thing
Ill say it in a rap cause I do not sing
DMC the man thats causin the grief
I got a message for the world so listen up its brief
Like Malcolm X said I wont turn the right cheek
Got the strength to go the length if you wanna start beef start beef
You know Im proud to be Black yall
And real brave yall
And motherfucker I could never be a slave yall
So take that
Gonna tell ya somethin put your mind in a swirl
God bless the next baby that comes in this world
The worlds full of hate discrimination and sin
People judgin other people by the color of skin
Ill attack this matter in my own way
Man I aint no slave I aint bailin no hay
Written a deposition in any condition
Dont get in my way cause Im full of ambition
Im proud to be Black and I aint takin no crap
Im fresh out the pack and Im proud to be Black so take that
There was a man an inventor who invented so well
He invented a fortune for a man named Bell
George Washington Carver made the peanut great
Showed any man with a mind could create
You read about Malcolm X in the history text
Jesse Owens broke records Ali broke necks
Whats wrong with ya man How can you be so dumb
Like Dr King said We shall overcome
