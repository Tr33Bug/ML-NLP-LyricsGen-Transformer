RunDMC
Live for you fresh
For all you sucker MCs perpetratin a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
Youre the kind of guy that girl ignored
Im drivin a Caddy you fixin a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle names Ward
And when Im rockin on the mic you should all applaud
Because were wheelin dealin we got a funny feelin
We rock from the floor up to the ceilin
We groove it you move it it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin
We create it relate it and often demonstrate it
Well diss a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it
Were risin suprisin and often hypnotizin
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls no braids peasyhead and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and crossfades
Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didnt fail
I couldnt wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
Im a wizard of a word thats what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
Im the master of a mic thats what I say
And if I didnt say that youd say it any way
Bust into the party come in the place
See the first things come the music in your face
Girls on the walls some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it cant be missed
And you cant leave til youre dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you cant leave until were through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade thats not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok youre not in a rut
Each and everybody out there we got the notion
We want to see yall all in motion
Just shake wiggle jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side back and forth
Were the two MCs and were gonna go off
Stand in place walk or run
Tap your feet youll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJs better than all these bands
Huh
We got all the lines and all the rhymes
We dont drop dimes and we dont do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear the pants they call the Calvin Kleins
Cause Calvin Kleins no friend of mine
Dont want nobodys name on my behind
Lee on my legs sneakers on my feet
D by my side and Jay with the beat  Beat 
Jay Jay Jay Jay uh uh
We dont stop
Dont dont stop  Jay 
One one two two three three
The the Hollis Hollis crew crew
For for for for for the love now
Cool T now hah hah
