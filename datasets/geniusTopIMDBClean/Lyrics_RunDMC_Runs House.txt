Ah once again my friend not a trend for then
They said rap was crap but never had this band
Till the ruler came with a cooler name
Made ya dance and prance and drove the fans insane

Not a gun thats done and get done by none
The other act in fact ya just wack I kill  Why 
Its fun my son and Run heads the bill
Whose house  Say what

Reporters clock  clock  producers jock  jock

Wanted by every fan  fan  across the land  land

Another time I take for the rhyme I make
Make me mad and sad because the fad is fake
See I do this thing so come pursue this king
One minor rhyme is all you just bring
Cause Im the best Im def ask the rest they left
Thats my name my game and we dont need the ref
So get the booze you lose and suckas close your mouth
I set a trap for rap thats crap its Runs house
Whose house  Say what 
Runs house  Say what 
Whose house  Say what

Some underestimate and miscalculate
My intent to create what I call the great
Till I make a song  song  that I prove em wrong  wrong 
See my song so strong itll make em come along  long 
Come in the door  door  get on the floor  floor 
Hard rock hard hitting hip hop hardcore  core 
Causing casualties and catastrophes
And tragedies for the suck emcees
Using strategies to get the best of me
You dirty rat emcees whoever you may be
You need to go down south  south 
You need to shut your mouth  mouth 
Its all about no doubt just shout cause we turn it out
Whose house  Say what 
Runs house  Say what 
Whose house  Say what 
Runs house  Say what 
Say what Say what
Say what Say what
Say what
