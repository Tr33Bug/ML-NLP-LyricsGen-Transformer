Sucker MCs  KrushGroove 1  Lyrics
Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme Im about to say
The rhyme was Def athen it went this way
Took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin on the microphone
And then we talkin autograph and cheers and laugh
Champagne caviar and bubble bath
But see ahh ah thats the life ah that I lead
And you sucker MCs is who I please
So take that and move back catch a heart attack
Because theres nothin in the world that Runll ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a bboy stance
And rock on the mic and make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a Dove that come from up above
Im rockin on the mic and you can call me RunLove
I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads Dressed to Kill
So if you see me cruisin girls just amove or step aside
There aint enough room to fit you all in my ride
Its on a ah first come first serve basis
Coolin out girl take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your peoples delight
And for you sucker MC you just aint right
Because youre bitin all your life youre cheatin on your wife
Youre walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife
Youre hangin on the ave chillin with the crew
And everybody know what youve been through
Ah with the one two three three to two one
My man Larry Larr my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
Im rockin to the rhythm wont you watch it on my face
Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker MCs you sadfaced clown
You a fivedollar boy and Im amillion dollar man
Youse a sucker MC and youre my fan
You try to bite lines but rhymes are mine
Youse a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin from the wackest part of town
Tryin to rap up but you cant get down
You dont even know your English your verb or noun
Youre just a sucker MC you sadfaced clown
So DMC and if youre ready
The people rockin steady
Youre drivin big cars get your gas from Getty
Im DMC in the place to be
I go to St Johns University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
Im lightskinned I live in Queens
And I love eatin chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill I love the style
Im an MC you know whos versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown I come back home
With who me myself and my microphone
All my rhymes are sweet delight
So heres another one for yall to bite
When I rhyme I never quit
And if I got a new rhyme Ill just say it
Cause it takes a lot to entertain
And sucker MCs can be a pain
You cant rock a party with the hip in hop
You gotta let em know youll never stop
The rhymes have to make  a lot of sense 
You got to know where to start  when the beats commence
