I gotta come to your rings cause Im so high
That even you and R Kelly believe I can fly
Selling jammies when them Grammy rappers chanting and cheering
Selling more than all of yall without a record in years
My catalog got a long list of hits in the stores
And for you samplehappy suckers out there breaking the laws
Rather hit you where it gets you bring you up on a charge
Youd be better just to let a lawyer know from the start
The King of Rock who
That be my hobby and job
And when I come and bring the ruckus
Suckers duck and then dodge
