Together Forever  KrushGrooveÂ 4   Lyrics expanded enhanced rerelease
Ayo man can we see them mics man
One two one two and I say
Party people your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats and lets get ill
Thats right yall were not just rough were more than tough
And when it comes to rhymes we got enough
Its like that yall and we dont stop the body rock
Now its together  forever  forever  together 
RunDMC and were tougher than leather
Were making and breaking and snatching and taking
The deals for real we could never be faking
Im chilling hes cooling Im a king thats ruling
Preach and teach and always schooling
See were learning and earning the tables keep turning
To be like us you could cold be yearning
Pulsating dominating up above
Cold chilling and Im willing the names RunLove
Creating devastating in the place to be
Full of soul and mic control because its easy to D
Beat making never faking chilling all of the time
For playing rhyme saying and I get mine
No way to rock me no way to stop me
Its seems quite shocking to those that mock me
And thats not all MCs have the gall
To pray and plan for my downfall
But Im not running Im just stunning
Smart not stupid cause Im so cunning
MCs regret it Im upsetting
My recitals take titles and titles Im betting
Like that yall so just keep above
See my name is DJ Run they call me RunLove
Creative creator creating the rhyme
Devastating devastator not doing a crime
Making beats every day and I get mine
The biggest star going far so check the shine
Big winner not a sinner when I do my thing
I might have a sling or a fling cause Im down with the king
Biggest rap no crap I do not sing
You want a show let me know just give me your ring
Like that yall were just keeping it on
DMC my man to the break of dawn rock
Im ill I chill with skill I kill
And none of my rhymes are run of the mill
I cause grief Im chief there is no beef
And if theres beef I knock out teeth
MCs act dumb they know where Im from
The King from Queens and Im down with Run
I take a stand my man and I wont sit
Cause Im the real deal like Coke is it
Then you wont find my name in the yellow page
Cause Run only speaks when its on the stage
I got a rhyme in line thats easy to find
With a sketch so check so one of a kind
Got two MCs and one DJ
Grab at least 20 Gs when we play
So DMC my boy my mellow my man
So get on the mic and wont you take the stand
My rock is hard you cant pull my card
Im a shining star shining near and far
Shining like the sun on a day of fun
Always on the move cause Im down with Run
Im the cool and calm Im the calm and cool
Im not a fool I went to school
My name is DMC I tell no lie
And I graduated from Cooley High
I am the only rapper who will not die
Im a greusome guy and you can try
To battle DMC but you must be high
