Unconceivable unbelievable
Grammar like a hammer information receivable
Sent by the Lord here and abroad
With words well adored now they cant be ignored
ForForForForce of course that makes Run the boss
So get lost because I just toss a punk
Make way today and if I may I say
I make pay with Jay so get away OKAY
Gainin weight I ate the whole plate to date
Never rate the great I go state to state
Just peep and keep but dont sleep or weep
Get deep to leap or Ill beep the Jeep
Put down the clown get round the town
I found the sound and Ill pound the ground
Get paid and laid not jayed or fraid
So I stayed and made not a bad debate
Got a group to troop with a shoop de shoop
Shoot hoop then scoop on this loop to loop
Goin off and on not soft of course
Just black and back to go back and forth
Go to school and cool not drool or pool
Got soul and gold and cold hold a jewel
Upset the best I met met a jest
Just lest the pest and I am the best
Got a punch to crunch cold munch for lunch
Not Grady or the lady from the Brady Bunch
Got Gs and Lees like Ds and Ts
Charge Bs to freeze all MCs with ease
No dope to cope just good to go

The perception of the life were as strong as D
Never frightened Im writin writin for whats right
Not schemin thievin in the night Im keepin with my mic
I got to go for broke and I aint no joke
I wont yoke and choke cept the suckers I smoked
Bumrush and crush leave em in the dust
I choose to bust the bust the scums who mess with us
Only strong survive and the weak will die
As long as Im alive I keep my head up high
Because Im strong in body and smart in mind
I was born to rhyme as a gift to mankind
No punk or chump never givin no slack
Well be killin a villain and like chillin Yo black

Cause Im
Rough and tough cold huff and puff
Dont bluff the stuff got enough to muff
Go long and on no longer song
Go on and on just for past the dawn
Put preach and teach with a speech to reach
All streets and each with beats for treats
Got the King Supreme may seem the clean
With a beat and a ring no dream machine
Not a gang to bang out to hang with slang
Talking yang and tang about everythang
Just brothers and others like fathers and mothers
Who discovered they love us that think theyre up and above us
No crime or time just rhyme and Im
Full grown and own no phone or dime
Just cut the stuff til you get enough
Cause were rougher than tougher and rougher tougher than tough

guitar solo
Ah with a voice like thunder words of wonder
Over all standin tall and the suckers fall under
Posessed with power cowards will cower
Ducks we devour hour hour after hour
Three man riot you cant deny it
Were so ill that you cant defy it
Gonna live POSITIVE forever AND EVER
RunDMC and were Tougher Than Leather
