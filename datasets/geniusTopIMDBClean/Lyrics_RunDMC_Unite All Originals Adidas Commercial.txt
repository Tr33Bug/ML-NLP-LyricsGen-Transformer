Unite All Originals  Adidas Commercial  Lyrics
Yeah Yeah Yeah
I ink a deal with Adidas my pinkie stinky with stones
Now that was back in the day now little Dicky is grown
And I was hot in the 80s feel Im hotter than you
Had a Rolls and a Rollie and Run with  in the room
Rock Adidas Adidas the sneaker leaders for years
You can say what you wanna but my Adidas is here
D the king of the rappers and even king of the hood
Had a list of his wishes he wish a whack rapper would
Man I was wheelin and grinnin they wasnt takin it well
Jay was rockin the wheels and we was rocking the shells
New York to Philly got illie rockin harder than Harden
Did the stretch and then left em and went and ripped up The Garden
Entire flyer no higher like 40 Benz and a Jag
Ask any rapper alive the Rev invented the swag
All day on display amazing style
Everything I sayll make the crowd go wild
Jam Master Jay give me chance by the pile
Put me in my Adidas since I was a child
Im in my pro models that I model like the pros
I go full throttle Im a lot like Derek Rose
Im Adidas down from my head to my toes
Even when Im in the gym its the threestripe shorts
White superstars with the three black stripes
Im like a god when Im rocking this mic
The greatest MC in all the years
The best sneakers in the world is the brand called Adidas
In case you in case you in case you forgot
Me and my Adidas always standing on top
We rule hiphop and all of the sports
The man on the beat is ATrak of course
7100   90
