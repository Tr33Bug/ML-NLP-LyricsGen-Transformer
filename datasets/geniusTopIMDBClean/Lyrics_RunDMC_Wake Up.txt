 Wake up   wake up 
Get up 
Wake up   wake up 
Get up 
Wake up 
When I woke up this morning and got out the bed
I had some really fresh thoughts going through my head
They were the thoughts that came from a wonderful dream
It was the vision of a world working as a team
It was a dream  get up 
Just a dream  wake up   wake up   get up 
There were no guns no what
No tanks no what atomic bombs
And to be frank homeboy there were no arms
Just people working hand in hand
There was a feeling of peace all across the land
It was a dream  wake up 
Just a dream  get up   wake up   wake up 
Between all countries there were good relations
There finally was a meaning to united nations
And everybody had an occupation
Cause we all worked together to fight starvation
It was a dream  wake up 
Just a dream  wake up   get up 
Everyone was treated on an equal basis
No matter what colors religions or races
We werent afraid to show our faces
It was cool to chill in foreign places
It was a dream  get up 
Just a dream  wake up   wake up   get up 
Wake up   wake up   get up   wake up 

All cities of the world were renovated
And the people all chilled and celebrated
They were all so happy and elated
To live in the world that they created
It was a dream  get up 
Just a dream  wake up   wake up   get up 
There were no street people we live rent free
And every single person had a place to be
A job a home and the perfect pay
And the world was free of greed and hate
It was a dream  wake up 
Just a dream  get up   wake up   wake up 
Unemployment was at a record low
And the presidents were chillin at our show
Listening to the things that we had to say
And trying to create a new and brighter day
It was a dream  wake up 
Just a dream  wake up 
It was a dream  get up 
Just a dream  wake up 
It was a dream  wake up 
Just a dream  get up 
It was dream  wake up 
Just a dream   wake up 
Get up   wake up   wake up 
Get up   wake up   wake up 
Get up   wake up   wake up 
Get up   wake up   wake up
