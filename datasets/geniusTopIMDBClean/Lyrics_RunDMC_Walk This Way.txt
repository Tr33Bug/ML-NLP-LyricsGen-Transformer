Now theres a backseat lover thats always undercover
And I talk til my daddy say
Said You aint seen nothing til youre down on a muffin
And theres sure to be a change in ways
Now theres a cheerleader thats a real big bleeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss like this
Seesaw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air
Singing Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle
And they swinging like it just dont care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasnt me she was foolin cause she knew what was she was doin
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way talk this way  She told me to 
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
Ooh like this
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee
It was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And they found they were looking at D
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady
Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss like this
Seesaw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing Hey diddle diddle with your kitty in the middle
I was swinging like I didnt care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasnt me she was foolin when she knew what she was doin
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way talk this way  She told me to 
Walk this way talk this way
Walk this way talk this way
Well just gimme some head
Like this
