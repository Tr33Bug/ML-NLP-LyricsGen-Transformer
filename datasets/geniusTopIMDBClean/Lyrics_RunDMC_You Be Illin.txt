One day when I was chillin in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin my business eatin food and finger lickin
This dude walked in lookin strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didnt walk straight kind of sidetoside
He asked this old lady Yo yo um is this Kentucky Fried
The lady said Yeah smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order small fry and Big Mac
You be illin  Yo yo what you tell that kid  illin
You be illin illin
You be illin illin
You be illin illin
Today you won a ticket to see Doctor J
Front row seat  In free  no pay
Radio in hand snacks by feet
Games about to start you kickin popcorn to the beat
You finally wake up Docs gone to town
Round his back through the hoop then you scream Touchdown
You be illin illin
You be illin illin
You be illin illin  Run what you tell that kid 
You be illin illin
The other day around the way I seen you illin at a party
Drunk as a skunk you illin punk and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said Yo yo can I get this dance
She smelled your breath and then she left you standin in your illin stance

You be illin illin  Yo Run what you tell that kid

For dinner you ate it there is none left
It was salty with butter and it was def
You proceeded to eat it cause you was in the mood
