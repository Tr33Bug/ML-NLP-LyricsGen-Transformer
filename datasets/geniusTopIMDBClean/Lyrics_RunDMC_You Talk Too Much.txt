SHUT UP
You talk too much
You talk too much
You talk too much
You talk too much
Hey You over there I know about your kind
Youre like the Independent Network News on Channel 9
Everywhere that you go no matter where you are at
I said you talk about this and you talk about that
When the cat took your tongue I say you took it right back
Your mouth is so big one bite could kill a Big Mac
You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up
You talk about people you dont even know
And you talk about places you NEVER go
You talk about your girl from head to toe
I said your mouths moving fast and your brains moving slow
You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up
Youre the instigator the orator of the town
Youre the worst when you converse just a big mouth clown
You talk when youre awake I heard you talk when you sleep
Has anyone ever told you that talk is cheap
You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP 


Talking is the one thing that you can do best
You told the cavity creeps to watch out for Crest
You never have the story right and exact
And then you always try to bore me with your yakkity yak
You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP 
Every day you are out fighting someone in the street
And youre always fighting someone you know ya cant beat
Then you wonder how you got in this mess
Just think of what you said then take a guess
You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP 
Youre always spreading rumors whether bad or good
Youre the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood
The Barbara Walters and the Howard Cosell
You always come around with a story to tell
You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP 
Said its everybodys business that you love to mind
And talkin to you is like dropping a dime
Youre spreading the word like it is your job
You should be a stool pigeon who works for the mob
You talk too much
Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up
A big blabbermouth thats what you are
If you were a talk show host youd be a star
I said your mouth is big size extra large
And when you open it its like my garage
You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP 
You always like to gossip just like a girl
You talk so damn much its outta this world
When youre reincarnated in your second life
You wont be a man youll be a nagging wife
You talk too much
Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP 
SHUT UP
SHUT UP
Twentyfive hours eight days a week
Thirteen months out a year is when you speak
Im tired of listening to the garbage you talk
Why dont you find a short pier then take a long walk
You talk too much
Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP 
You talk too much
You could be out of breath
You talk too much
Man you naggin me to death
You talk too much
Tired of hearing you speak
You talk too much
Eight days a week
You talk too much
Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Why dont you ever shut up  SHUT UP 
You talk too much
Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up  SHUT UP
