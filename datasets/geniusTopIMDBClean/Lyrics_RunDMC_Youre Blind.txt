Tenement buildings and skyscrapers
Are polluted and often invaded
With troubled hearts and weakened minds
Living their lives and hoping to find
The golden key to prosperity
Never have a grip on reality
This makes day to day living hard
Trumpin your fate never peepin the card
You just goin through life without a trace
When the answers you seek are in front of your face
Youre blind Youre blind
Tell em D
Youre headed for the top or so you think
But thats not true for you your life is on the brink
Of selfdestruction total corruption
You better get out or die from consumption
Sweat for a dollar to get nothin back
Cause at the end of the week you still get taxed
Youd even sell your soul to make your life correct
But with the rate of inflation you should eat your check
So you try to make a hustle to get ahead
But the only thing you manage is to stay in the red
Coppin from John to sell to Rex
And your jones for success has put your life in check
Youre blind Youre blind
And you cant see
You need to wear some glasses

Youre blind
So you think the facts means you cant win
So you devote your time to a life of sin


Hangin out late is how you survive
Makin deals talkin jive and tellin lies
Pressure beatin you down
Like youre not handlin
And all the while your mind is ramblin
About bein fly
Or even sly
And bein held low in the public eye
You decide these things but you dont know why
Youre standin on a corner cold playin the post
Cause another sucker you were chillin the most
Youre blind Youre blind
Yo you cant see
You need to wear some glasses

Youre blind Youre blind
You  run  round talkin bout what you hate
Livin your life just to perpetrate
You think your style is chill because youre always cold
With your platform shoes and your fake gold
So you think youre bad
Sheer dynamite
But if you only knew the crew called you freaks delight
Wearin the tightest jeans and shortest skirt
You think youre cold chillin lookin like a jerk
No matter what you do come out second rate
Thinkin youre on time but youre already late
Youre blind
Youre blind And you cant see
You need to wear some glasses

The moral to the story may not be clear
And the only way to catch it is to lend an ear
Stop frontin so hard
Why dont you peep your card
And your goals in life may not be far
Because these words I say are meant for you to hear
So if you bust these facts you will persevere
Youre blind Youre blind
And you cant see
