I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh and just like the river Ive been runnin
Ever since
Its been a long
A long time comin but I know
A change gon come
Oh yes it will
Its been too hard livin
But Im afraid to die
Cause I dont know whats up there
Beyond the sky
Its been a long
A long time comin but I know
A change gon come
Oh yes it will
I go to the movie
And I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin me dont hang around
Its been a long
A long time comin but I know
A change gon come
Oh yes it will
Then I go to my brother
And I say Brother help me please
But he winds up
Knockin me
Back down on my knees
Lor there been times that I thought
I couldnt last for long
But now I think Im able to
Carry on
Its been a long
A long time comin but I know
A change gon come
Oh yes it will
