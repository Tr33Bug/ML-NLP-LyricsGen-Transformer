No one to walk with all by myself
No one to talk with but Im happy on the shelf
Aint misbehaving Im saving my love for you
I know for certain the one I love
Im thru with flirting its just you Im thinking of
Aint misbehaving Im saving my love for you
Im Like Jack Horner in the corner
I dont go nowhere what do I care
Your kisses are worth waiting for believe me
I dont stay out late no place to go
Im home about eight just me and my radio
Aint misbehaving saving all of my love for you
No one to walk with all by myself
No one to talk with but Im happy on the shelf
Aint misbehaving Im saving my love for you
I know for certain the one I love
Im thru with flirting its just you Im thinking of
Aint misbehaving Im saving my love for you
Im like Jack Horner in the corner
I dont go nowhere what do I care
Your kisses are worth waiting for believe me
I dont stay out late thats not for me
Im home about eight just quit looking at my TV
Aint misbehaving saving all of my love for you
