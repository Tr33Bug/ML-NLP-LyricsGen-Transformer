Ain’t Misbehavin’ LyricsNo one to walk with, all by myself
No one to talk with, but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehaving, I'm saving my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm thru with flirting, it's just you I'm thinking of
Ain't misbehaving, I'm saving my love for you

I'm Like Jack Horner in the corner
I don't go nowhere, what do I care
Your kisses are worth waiting for, believe me
I don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehaving, saving all of my love for you

No one to walk with, all by myself
No one to talk with, but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehaving, I'm saving my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm thru with flirting, it's just you I'm thinking of
Ain't misbehaving, I'm saving my love for you

I'm like Jack Horner in the corner
I don't go nowhere, what do I care
Your kisses are worth waiting for, believe me

I don't stay out late, that's not for me
I'm home about eight, just quit looking at my TV
Ain't misbehaving, saving all of my love for youYou might also likeEmbed
