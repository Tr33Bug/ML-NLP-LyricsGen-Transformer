Aint That  Good News LyricsOh my babys comin home tomorrow
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
Babys comin home tomorrow
Aint that news
Man aint that news
I got a letter just the other day
Tellin me that she was on her way
And she want me to meet her at the station
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
In the letter she told me she still loved me
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
In the letter she told me she loved me
Aint that news
Man aint that news
She said shes sorry that she left
Found out she dont want nobody else
Said she wants me all to herself
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
Aint that news
Aint that good news
Man I know thats good news
My babys comin home tomorrow
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
Im gonna have her a party at the station
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
Have a party at the station
Aint that news
Man aint that news
I cant wait to get her home
Where we can finally be alone
Disconnect my telephone
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
Aint that news
Aint that good news
Man man man aint that news
My babys comin home tomorrow
Aint that good news
Man aint that news
Good news
Good news
Aint that good news
Aint that news
