(Ainâ€™t That) Good News LyricsOh my baby's comin' home tomorrow
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?
Baby's comin' home tomorrow
Ain't that news?
Man ain't that news?

I got a letter just the other day
Tellin' me that she was on her way
And she want me to meet her at the station
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?
In the letter, she told me she still loved me
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?
In the letter, she told me she loved me
Ain't that news?
Man ain't that news?

She said she's sorry that she left
Found out she don't want nobody else
Said she wants me all to herself
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?

Ain't that news?
Ain't that good news?
Man I know that's good news
My baby's comin' home tomorrow
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?

I'm gonna have her a party at the station
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?
Have a party at the station
Ain't that news?
Man ain't that news?
You might also likeI can't wait to get her home
Where we can finally be alone
Disconnect my telephone
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?

Ain't that news?
Ain't that good news?
Man, man, man ain't that news?
My baby's comin' home tomorrow
Ain't that good news?
Man ain't that news?

Good news
Good news
Ain't that good news?
Ain't that news?Embed
