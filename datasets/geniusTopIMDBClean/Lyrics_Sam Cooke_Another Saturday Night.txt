Another Saturday night and I aint got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
Im in an awful way
I got in town a month ago I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet em I could get em but as yet I havent met em
Thats why Im in the shape Im in
Another Saturday night and I aint got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
Im in an awful way
Another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein
Another Saturday night and I aint got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
Im in an awful way
Here it is another weekend and I aint got nobody
Man if I was back home Id be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww yeah
Listen to me huh 
Its hard on a fella when he dont know his way around
If I dont find me a honey to help me spend my money
Im gonna have to blow this town
Another Saturday night and I aint got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
Im in an awful way
