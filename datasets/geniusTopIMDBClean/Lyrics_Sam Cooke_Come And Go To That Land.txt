Come And Go To That Land LyricsWell come and go
Come and go now
Come and go now, where I'm bound
Come and go come and go now

Promise I will save
I'm a solemn believer in that land
In that land, oh Lord, where I'm bound
O, Come and go to that land, oh Lord, now
Where I'm bound
Come and go, come and go now
Let us go now, where I'm bound

You find peace, find find peace now where I'm bound
Find peace, find peace now, find peace now where I'm bound

Hear the voice, Jesus is calling
Oh I see, did it sound
All your trying will be over
In that land where I'm bound

Come and go Lord come and go now where I'm bound
You find joy, find joy now
Where I'm bound

You found joy now where I'm bound

Keep on working on your building
If you want your starry crown
Selling will make your burden lighter

Where I'm bound
Joy, joy joy, joy
