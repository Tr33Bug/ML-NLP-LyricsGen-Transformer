Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lovers heart for me for me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lovers heart for me
Now I dont mean to bother you
But Im in distress
Theres danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesnt know I exist
And this you can fix
So
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lovers heart for me nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lovers heart for me

I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us her heart we can steal
Help me if you will
So
Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lovers heart for me nobody but me
Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lovers heart for me
