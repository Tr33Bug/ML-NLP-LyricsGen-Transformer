Cupid Lyrics[Chorus]
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, for me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Verse 1]
Now, I don't mean to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix
So
[Chorus]
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Verse 2]
Now, Cupid, if your arrow make her love strong for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us, her heart we can steal
Help me if you will
So

[Chorus]
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Outro]
Now, Cupid
Don't you hear me?
Calling you
I need you
Cupid
Help me!
I need you
Cupid
Don't fail me
'Cause I need youYou might also like3Embed
