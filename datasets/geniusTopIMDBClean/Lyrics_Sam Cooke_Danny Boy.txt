Danny Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go and I must abide

[Bridge]
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in the shadows
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so
[Verse 2]
Oh Danny boy (Danny Boy), the pipes are calling
(Oh Danny boy, I hear the pipes calling)
From glen to glen (From glen to glen)
And down the mountainside
(And down, glen to glen to glen to glen and down the mountainside)
The summer's gone (I know the summer's gone)
And all the roses falling
(And all summer's gone and all the roses falling)
It's you, it's you (It's you, it's you must go)
Must go and I must abide
(And I, it's you must go and I'll abide)

[Outro]
But come ye back, come back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadows
Oh Danny boy, oh oh Danny boy, I love you so
