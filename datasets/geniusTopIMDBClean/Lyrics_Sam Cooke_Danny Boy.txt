Oh Danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountainside
The summers gone and all the roses falling
Its you its you must go and I must abide
But come ye back when summers in the meadow
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
Its Ill be here in sunshine or in the shadows
Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy I love you so
Oh Danny boy  Danny Boy  the pipes are calling
Oh Danny boy I hear the pipes calling 
From glen to glen  From glen to glen 
And down the mountainside
And down glen to glen to glen to glen and down the mountainside 
The summers gone  I know the summers gone 
And all the roses falling
And all summers gone and all the roses falling 
Its you its you  Its you its you must go 
Must go and I must abide
And I its you must go and Ill abide 
But come ye back come back when summers in the meadow
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
Its Ill be here in sunshine or in shadows
Oh Danny boy oh oh Danny boy I love you so
I love you so
