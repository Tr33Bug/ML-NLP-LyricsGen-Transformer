For sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me

Given you my heart because I mmm you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say well never part

And I know Im never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And tell well never part
I think of you every morning
Can I help it if I dream of you every night
No no no no Im never lonely
Whenever you are in sight
I know that I love you
And you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And tell we will never part
My darling I love you
