Good Times Lyrics[Intro]
Wo la da ta da
Lo la ta da
La da da all night long
Yeah
La la, la la ta da
La da da, da da ta da

Come on and let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long
One more time
Come on and let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long
[Verse 1]
Gotta tell you
Evening' sun is sinkin' low
The clock on the wall say it's time to go
I got my plans, I don't know about you
I'll tell you exactly what I'm gonna do

[Chorus]
Get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm gonna stay here till I soothe my soul
If it take all night long
Yeah, everybody let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long
Yeah

[Verse 2]
It might be 1 o'clock and it might be 3
Time don't mean that much to me
I ain't felt this good since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again

[Chorus]
So come on and let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long
And all night (All night) and all night (All night)
And all night (All night) and all night long (All night)
Somebody said it might (All night) take all night long
And all night (All night) and all night (All night), so
You might also like[Outro]
Come on and let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long1Embed
