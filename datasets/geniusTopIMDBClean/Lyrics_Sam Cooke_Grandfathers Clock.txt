Tick tock tick tock
Tick tock tick tock
Tick tock tick tock
Tick tock tick tock
Now my grandfathers clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood 90 years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
Now it was bought on the morn
Of the day that he was born
And it was always his treausure and pride
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died
Oh now my grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and it had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound and it kept in its place
Not a frown on his face
And his hands never hung by its side
But you know that it stopped short
Never to go again when the old man died
Now rang an alarm in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we that his spirit was plumming for flight
That his hour for departure had come
Still that clock kept the time
With a soft and muffled chime
As we solemnly stood by his side
But you know that it stopped short
Never to go again when the old man died
You know that it stopped short
Never to go again when the old boy died
