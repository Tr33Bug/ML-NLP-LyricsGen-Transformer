Were having a party
Dancing to the music
Played by the DJ
On the radio
The Cokes are in the icebox
The popcorns on the table
Me and my baby were out here on the floor
So mister Mister DJ
Keep those records playing
Cause Im having such a good time
Dancing with my baby
Everybodys swinging
Sallys doing that twist now
If you take requests Ive
Got a few for you
Play that song called Soul Twist
Play that one called I Know
Dont forget the Mashed Potatoes
No other songs will do
Let me tell you mister Mister DJ
Keep those records playing
Cause Im having such a good time
Dancing with my baby
Having a party  Yeah 
Everybodys swinging  Oh were 
Dancing to the music  Yeah 
On the radio  Oh were 
Having a party  Man 
Everybodys swinging  Yeah 
Were dancing to the music  Yeah 
On the radio  Tell em one more time 
Were having a party  Yeah 
And everybodys swinging  Oh were 
Dancing to the music  Yeah 
On the radio  Tell you were 
Having a party  Yeah 
Everybodys swinging
