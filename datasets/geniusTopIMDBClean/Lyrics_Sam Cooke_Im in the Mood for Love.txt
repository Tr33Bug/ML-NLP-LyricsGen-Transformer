Im in the mood for love
Simply because youre near me
Funny but when youre near me
Im in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars were under
Oh is it any wonder that
Im in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade
We put our hearts together
Now we are one dont be afraid
If theres a cloud above
If it should rain well let it
But for tonight forget it and get with it
Im in the mood for love
