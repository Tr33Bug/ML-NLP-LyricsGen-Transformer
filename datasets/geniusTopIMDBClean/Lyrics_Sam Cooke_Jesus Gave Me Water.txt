Woah Jesus gave me water Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave me water Jesus gave me water
Jesus gave me water and it was not in the well
Well there was a woman from Samaria came to the well to get some water
There she met a stranger who did a story tell
Then the woman dropped her pitcher
Shes drinking was made richer
From the water He gave her and it was not in the well
Yes He gave her water Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave her water He gave that woman water
Gave her living loving lasting water and it was not in the well
Well on that woman He had pity she ran back to the city
Crying glory Hallelujah and did His wonders tell
She left my Savior singing she came back to Him bringing
The times shed had water Lord and it was not in the well
Yes He gave her water Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water I wanna let His praises swell
Jesus gave that woman water gave her that love and lasting water
Water and it was not in the well
Well Lord that woman left a shoutin and there was no room for doubtin
That she had met a Savior who did all wonders tell
Every time she doubtin she start to think about Him
The man that gave her that water Lord and it was not in the well
Yes He gave her water Jesus gave her water
Jesus gave her water I wanna let His praises swell
Tell you He gave that woman water gave her that love and lasting water
Water water water water loving water and it was not in the well
