Little Red Rooster Lyrics[Verse 1]
I got a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
I got a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
He keeps everything in the barnyard upset in every way

[Verse 2]
The dogs begin to bark, the hounds begin to howl
The dogs begin to bark, the hounds begin to howl
Watch out, all you kinfolk, my little red rooster's on the prowl

[Verse 3]
I tell you that he keeps all the hens fighting among themselves
Keeps all the hens fighting among themselves
He don't want no hen in the barnyard layin' eggs for nobody else No
[Organ and Piano Interlude]
Play it, Billy
Answer him, Ray
Lord have mercy, yeah
Oh, yeah!
I like that, mm-hmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me tell everybody!

[Verse 4]
Now if you see my red rooster, send him home
Said if you see my red rooster, send him home
I ain't had no peace in the barnyard since my red rooster been goneYou might also like2Embed
