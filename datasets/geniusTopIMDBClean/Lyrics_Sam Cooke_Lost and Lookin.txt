Lost and Lookinâ€™ Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm lost and I'm looking for my baby
Wonder why my baby can't be found
I'm lost and I'm looking for my baby
Lord knows my baby ain't around
So I'm lost and I'm looking for my baby
Wonder why my baby can't be found
Lost and I'm searching for my baby
Lord knows my baby ain't around

[Bridge]
Crying for my baby
Crying all alone
Calling for you
Come home, come home
[Outro]
I'm lost and I'm calling for my baby
Baby, won't you please come home
I'm lost and I'm calling for my baby
I need you 'cause I'm so aloneYou might also like1Embed
