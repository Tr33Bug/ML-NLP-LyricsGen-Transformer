Mean Old World Lyrics[Chorus]
This is a mean old world to live in all by yourself
This is a mean old world to live in all by yourself
This is a mean world to be alone
Without someone to call your own
This is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourself

[Verse 1]
I wish I had someone, someone who'd love me true
I wish I had someone who loved me true
If I had someone who loved me true
Then I know I wouldn't be so blue
This is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourself
[Chorus]
Lord, this is a mean old world to live in all by, by, by, by
All by yourself
Mean old world to try and live in all by, by, by, by, by, by, by, by yourself
This is a mean world to be alone
Without someone to call your own
Lord, mean world to try and live in all by, by, by, by, by yourself

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I find myself dreaming I found a love
Sometimes I find myself dreaming I found a love
Sometimes I dream I really found a love
Someone who loved me true as the stars above
For this is a mean old world to try and live in all by yourselfYou might also likeEmbed
