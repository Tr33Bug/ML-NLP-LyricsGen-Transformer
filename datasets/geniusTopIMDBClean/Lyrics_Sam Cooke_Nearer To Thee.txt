The minister was preaching
And the crowd was standing near
The congregation was singing a tune
In a voice that was loud and clear
You know the crowd that stood around him
They were crying I could plainly see
For the song that they sang was touching
They were singing Nearer My God To Thee
O nearer my God to Thee nearer nearer to Thee
We kept on singing nearer my God nearer my God to Thee
Oh Lord we kept on singing nearer
Nearer my God nearer nearer to Thee
They kept on singing nearer my my God nearer my God to Thee
Oh yes nearer nearer
Songs have a feeling
Theres a story in every song that we sing
Songs that are known to lift heavy burdens
If all of our troubles to God we oughta bring
And if we are Christians we ought not to be ashamed
To lift our voices admire Jesus name
We ought to be able to sing nearer nearer my God to Thee
Oh help me Lord lift our voices and sing nearer nearer nearer yes
Nearer I want to get nearer to Thee
When I get lonely I can sing nearer
Nearer my God to Thee yes I can
I just bow down and say nearer and nearer nearer
Nearer my God to Thee nearer nearer my God to Thee
