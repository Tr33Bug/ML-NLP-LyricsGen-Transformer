Nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Glory hallelujah
Nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Nobody knows my my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Glory hall glory hallelujah
Sometimes Im up and sometimes Im down
Oh yes lord
You know sometimes almost to the ground
Oh oh yes lord
Still nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Nobody nobody knows my my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Glory hallelujah
If you get there before I do
Oh oh yes lord
Dont forget to tell all my friends Im coming too
Whoa oh yes lord
Still nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that Ive seen
Glory hall hallelujah
