If I go a million miles away
Id write a letter each and everyday
Cause honey nothing nothing can ever change this love I have for you
Mm make me weep and you can make me cry
See me coming and you can pass me by
But honey nothing nothing can ever change this love I have for you
Woohoh youre the apple of my eye youre cherry pie
And oh youre youre cake and ice cream
And oh youre sugar and spice and everything nice
Youre the girl of my my my my dreams
But if you wanted to leave me and roam
When you got back Id just say welcome home
Cause honey nothing nothing nothing can ever change this love I have for you
Woohohoh
I know I know I know I know I know that nothing nothing nothing can ever
Change the love I have for you
