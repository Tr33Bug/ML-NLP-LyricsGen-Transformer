Rolling along rolling along rolling along
Mmm old man river that old man river
He dont say nothing but he must know something
For old man river he just keeps rolling along
Mmm he dont plant taters he dont plant cotton
And them that buy some theyre soon forgotten
While old man river he just keeps rolling along
Mmm you and me we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail
I get weary and sick of trying
Im tired of living but afraid of dying
While old man river he just keeps rolling along
Rolling along rolling along rolling along
You and me we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail
I get weary and sick of trying
Im tired of living but afraid of dying
While old man river he just keeps rolling along
Rolling along rolling along rolling along
