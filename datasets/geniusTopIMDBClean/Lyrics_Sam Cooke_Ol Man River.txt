Olâ€™ Man River Lyrics[Intro]
Rolling along, rolling along, rolling along
Mmm, old man river, that old man river
He don't say nothing, but he must know something
For old man river, he just keeps rolling along

[Verse 1]
Mmm, he don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton
And them that buy some, they're soon forgotten
While old man river, he just keeps rolling along
[Bridge]
Mmm, you and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

[Verse 2]
I get weary and sick of trying
I'm tired of living but afraid of dying
While old man river he just keeps rolling along
Rolling along, rolling along, rolling along

[Bridge]
You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

[Outro]
I get weary and sick of trying
I'm tired of living but afraid of dying
While old man river he just keeps rolling along
Rolling along, rolling along, rolling alongYou might also likeEmbed
