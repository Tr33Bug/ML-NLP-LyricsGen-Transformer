One more river to cross ooh 
Before I reach my journeys end
One more river to cross ooh 
Before Ill be free from sin
One more mountain to climb 
Whoaoh before I finish this race
One mover river to cross 
Whoaoh before I see my Saviors face
One more river to cross 
Lord before Ill be free from fear
One more river to cross 
Before Ill be through shedding tears
One more mountain to climb 
Whoaoh before Ill be with the blessed
One more river to cross 
Whoaoh before Ill take my my rest
And Ive got one more  One more  river  River 
Ive got one more  One more  river  River 
Ive got one more  One more  mountain  Mountain 
Before I take my rest
One more river to cross 
Put the burden down here
They all make just one more  One more  river  River 
Trials is one more  One more  river  River 
Disappointment is one more  One more  mountain  Mountain 
Before I can take my rest
One more river to cross
