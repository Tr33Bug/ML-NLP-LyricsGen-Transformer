Only Sixteen LyricsShe was only sixteen, only sixteen
But I loved her so
She was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
We'd laugh and we'd sing
And do the little things
That made my heart glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
Why did I give my heart so fast
It never will happen again
But I was a mere lad of sixteen
I've aged a year since then

She was only sixteen, only sixteen
With eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

(But why did you give your heart so fast?)
Boy, it never will happen again
(But you were a mere lad of sixteen)
I've aged a year since then

She was only sixteen, only sixteen
With eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
She was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to knowYou might also like1Embed
