She was only sixteen only sixteen
But I loved her so
She was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
Wed laugh and wed sing
And do the little things
That made my heart glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
Why did I give my heart so fast
It never will happen again
But I was a mere lad of sixteen
Ive aged a year since then
She was only sixteen only sixteen
With eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
But why did you give your heart so fast 
Boy it never will happen again
But you were a mere lad of sixteen 
Ive aged a year since then
She was only sixteen only sixteen
With eyes that would glow
But she was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
She was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know
