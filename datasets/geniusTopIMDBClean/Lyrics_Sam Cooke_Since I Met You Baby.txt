Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
All my friends tell me
Im not the same
Let me tell you
Since I met you baby
Im a happy man
Since I met you baby
Looks like Im a happy man
Im gonna try and please you
In every way that I can
Let me tell you
I dont need nobody
To tell my troubles to
I dont need nobody
To tell my troubles to
Oh cause since I met you baby
All I need is you
And oh pretty baby
You know I love you baby
Better than I do myself
When Im with you
I dont need nobody else
Love me in the morning
You got to love me late at night
Love me in the morning
You got to love me late at night
When you love me
I hope everything is alright
