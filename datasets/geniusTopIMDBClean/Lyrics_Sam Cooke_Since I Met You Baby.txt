Since I Met You Baby LyricsSince I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
All my friends tell me
I'm not the same
Let me tell you
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby
Looks like I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try and please you
In every way that I can
Let me tell you

I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to

Oh, 'cause since I met you baby
All I need is you
And oh, pretty baby
You know I love you baby
Better than I do myself
When I'm with you
I don't need nobody else
Love me in the morning
You got to love me late at night
Love me in the morning
You got to love me late at night
When you love me
I hope everything is alrightYou might also likeEmbed
