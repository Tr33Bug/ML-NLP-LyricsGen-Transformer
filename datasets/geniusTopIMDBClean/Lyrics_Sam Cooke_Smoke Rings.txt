Smoke Rings LyricsWhere do they go
Smoke rings I blow each night?
Oh, where do they go
Those circles of blue and white?
I wonder
Why do they seem, to picture a dream above, above, above, above, above
Then why do they fade, my phantom parade of love?

Puff, puff, puff
Oh you can puff your cares away
Puff, puff, puff, night and day
Blow, blow them into air
Silky little rings
Oh little smoke rings I love
Please take me above, with you
One more little thing I want to know is
Where do they end?
The smoke rings I send on a high
Oh where are they hurled
When they've kissed the world goodbye

Let me tell you that
I'd give my life, to laugh at the strife below, below, below, down here below
Oh, for I'd be a king
I'd follow each ring I blow

Oh little smoke rings I love
Please take me above
Take me with you!You might also likeEmbed
