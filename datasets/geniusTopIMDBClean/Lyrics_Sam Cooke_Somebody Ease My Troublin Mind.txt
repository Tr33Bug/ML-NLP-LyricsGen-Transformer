(Somebody) Ease My Troublinâ€™ Mind LyricsI wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind
I wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind
Oh yes, I do
Why won't somebody come and ease my troublin' mind
I sure wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind

I wish my baby would come and tell me everything's allright
I sure wish my baby would come and tell me everything is still allright
Oh yes, I do
They tell me when you tell somebody your troubles
Trouble fly away from you
I'm looking, looking, looking for somebody
I can tell my troubles to
Why won't somebody come and ease my troublin' mind
I sure wish somebody would come and ease my troublin' mind
