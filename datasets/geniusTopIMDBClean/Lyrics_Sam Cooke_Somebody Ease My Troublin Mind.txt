Somebody  Ease My Troublin Mind LyricsI wish somebody would come and ease my troublin mind
I wish somebody would come and ease my troublin mind
Oh yes I do
Why wont somebody come and ease my troublin mind
I sure wish somebody would come and ease my troublin mind
I wish my baby would come and tell me everythings allright
I sure wish my baby would come and tell me everything is still allright
Oh yes I do
They tell me when you tell somebody your troubles
Trouble fly away from you
Im looking looking looking for somebody
I can tell my troubles to
Why wont somebody come and ease my troublin mind
I sure wish somebody would come and ease my troublin mind
Oh yeah
