When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the
Only light well see
No I wont be afraid
Oh I wont be afraid
Just as long just as long
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
So darling stand stand by me
Ho stand by me
Ho stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky we look upon
Should tumble and fall
All the mountains
Should crumble to the sea
I wont cry I wont cry
No I wont shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
And darling darling
Stand by me
Ho stand by me
Whoa stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me
And darling darling
Stand by me
Ho stand by me
Whoa stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me
Whenever youre in trouble
Wont you stand by me
Ho stand by me
Whoa stand now
