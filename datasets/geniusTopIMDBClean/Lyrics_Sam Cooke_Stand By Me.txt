Stand By Me LyricsWhen the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the
Only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling stand, stand by me
Ho, stand by me
Ho, stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
If the sky we look upon
Should tumble and fall
All the mountains
Should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

And darling, darling
Stand by me
Ho, stand by me
Whoa stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me

[Instrumental]

And darling, darling
Stand by me
Ho, stand by me
Whoa stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand, by me
Ho, stand by me
Whoa stand now
