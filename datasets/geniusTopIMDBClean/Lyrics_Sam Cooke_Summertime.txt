Its summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddys rich and your mamas good looking
Hush little baby
Dont you cry
Hmmmm
One of these mornings youre gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by
Hmmmm
