Tennessee Waltz LyricsI was dancing with my baby to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my baby and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost
Yes I lost my, lost my baby the night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee WaltzYou might also like1Embed
