When we used to say goodnight
Id always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you dont seem to care
You close the door and leave me
Standing there oh honey thats not fair
Thats it I quit Im moving on
Yeah The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared the lipstick on your face
Oh they smeared it everyplace yeah
Thats it I quit Im moving on aw
You made me want you
You made me need you
You made me tumble and fall but
If I cant have you the way I want you
I dont want you at all yeah
Baby I can take a lot
Cause I love everything you got
You know your kisses thrill me so
But if youve got someone else
Ive gotta go aw and that you know
Thats it honey I quit Im moving on
Yeah now
You made me want you
You made me need you
You made me tumble and fall but
If I cant have you the way I want you
Then I dont want you at all yeah
Baby I can take a lot
Cause I love everything you got
You know your kisses thrill me so
But if youve got someone else
Ive gotta go aw and that you know

Thats it Baby I quit Im moving on
And one more time
Thats it Honey I quit Im moving on
