All the moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life theyre free
Stars belong to everyone
They cling there for you and for me
Flowers in spring
The robins that sing
The sunbeams that shine
Theyre yours and theyre mine
Love can come to everyone
Best things in life theyre free
Moon belongs to everyone
The best things in life theyre free
Stars belong to everyone
They glitter there for you and me
They are yours and me
Flowers in spring
The robins that sing
Sunbeams that shine yall
Theyre yours and theyre mine yall
Love can come to everyone
Best things in life theyre free
All of the good things
Every one of the better things
The best best things in life theyre free
Ha
