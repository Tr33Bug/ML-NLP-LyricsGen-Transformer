The Lonesome Road Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up, look up
And see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn

[Bridge]
I get weary toting such a load
Traveling down that lonesome road
[Verse 2]
Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, look down, look down
Look down the lonesome road
Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, look up, look up
Look up and see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn

[Bridge]
I get so weary toting, weary toting such a load
Trudging down, trudging down the lonesome road

[Verse 3]
Look, look, look, look, look down
Look down the lonesome road
B-B-B-Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, look down, look down
Look, look down the lonesome road
Before you travel, before you travel on
Look up, look up
Look up and see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn
You might also like[Bridge]
Whoa, I'm weary toting, weary toting such a load
Trudging down, trudging down the lonesome road

[Outro]
Look, look, look, look, look down
Look down the lonesome road
Look down the lonesome road before you travel on
Whoa-oh, before you travel on
B-B-B-B-B-Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, whoa, before you travel onEmbed
