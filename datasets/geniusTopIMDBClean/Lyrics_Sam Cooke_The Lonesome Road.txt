Look down look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up look up
And see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn
I get weary toting such a load
Traveling down that lonesome road
Look down look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on
Whoaoh look down look down
Look down the lonesome road
Before you travel on
Whoaoh look up look up
Look up and see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn
I get so weary toting weary toting such a load
Trudging down trudging down the lonesome road
Look look look look look down
Look down the lonesome road
BBBBefore you travel on
Whoaoh look down look down
Look look down the lonesome road
Before you travel before you travel on
Look up look up
Look up and see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn


Whoa Im weary toting weary toting such a load
Trudging down trudging down the lonesome road
Look look look look look down
Look down the lonesome road
Look down the lonesome road before you travel on
Whoaoh before you travel on
