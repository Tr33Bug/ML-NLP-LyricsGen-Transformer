The Riddle Song LyricsI gave my love a cherry that had no stone
I gave my love a chicken that had no bone
I gave my love a ring that had no end
I gave my love a baby with no cryin'

How can there be a cherry that has no stone
How can there be a chicken that has no bone
How can there be a ring that has no end
How can there be a baby with no cryin'

A cherry when it's bloomin', it has no stone
A chicken when it's pippin' ain't got no bone
A ring when it's rollin', it has no end
And oh, a baby when it's sleepin', there's no cryin'
A baby when it's sleepin'
There's no cryin'You might also likeEmbed
