I gave my love a cherry that had no stone
I gave my love a chicken that had no bone
I gave my love a ring that had no end
I gave my love a baby with no cryin
How can there be a cherry that has no stone
How can there be a chicken that has no bone
How can there be a ring that has no end
How can there be a baby with no cryin
A cherry when its bloomin it has no stone
A chicken when its pippin aint got no bone
A ring when its rollin it has no end
And oh a baby when its sleepin theres no cryin
A baby when its sleepin
Theres no cryin
