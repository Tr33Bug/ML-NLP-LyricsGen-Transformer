Way out west theyve got a name
For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess the fires Joe and
They call the wind Mariah
Oh now Mariah blows the stars around
And sends the clouds aflying
Mariah makes the mountain sounds
Like folks were up there dying
Mariah Mariah
They call the wind Mariah
Now before I knew Mariahs name
And heard her wail and whining
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shining
Oh but then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now Im lost Im oh so lost
Not even God can find me
Mmm Mariah oh Mariah
They call the wind Mariah
Oh out here theyve got a name for rain
For wind and fire only
But when youre lost and all alone
There aint no word but lonely
Oh yeah and Im a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me
Mariah blow my love to me
I need my girl beside me
Mmm Mariah oh Mariah
Im lonely cant you see
Mmm Mariah oh Mariah
Please blow my love to me
Mariah blow my love to me
