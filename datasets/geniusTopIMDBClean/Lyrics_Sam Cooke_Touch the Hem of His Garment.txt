Touch the Hem of His Garment Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whoa, there was a woman in the Bible days
She had been sick, sick so very long
But she heard 'bout Jesus was passin' by
So she joined the gathering throng
And while she was pushing her way through
Someone asked her, "What are you trying to do?"
She said, "If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole"

[Chorus]
She cried "Oh, Lord (Oh, Lord), and whoa, Lord (Oh, Lord)
And oh, oh Lord, and whoa, Lord (Oh, Lord)"
Said, "If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole"
[Verse 2]
And whoa, she spent her money here and there
Until she had no, had no more to spare
The doctors, they'd done all they could
But their medicine would do no good
When she touched Him, the Savior didn't see
But still he turned around and cried, "Somebody touched me"
She said, "It was I who just wanna touch the hem of your garment
I know I'll be made whole right now"

[Outro]
She stood there cryin', "Oh (Oh, Lord) Oh (Oh, Lord)
And oh, oh Lord, and whoa, Lord (Oh, Lord)
Said, "If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole right now"You might also likeEmbed
