Whoa there was a woman in the Bible days
She had been sick sick so very long
But she heard bout Jesus was passin by
So she joined the gathering throng
And while she was pushing her way through
Someone asked her What are you trying to do
She said If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know Ill be made whole
She cried Oh Lord  Oh Lord  and whoa Lord  Oh Lord 
And oh oh Lord and whoa Lord  Oh Lord 
Said If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know Ill be made whole
And whoa she spent her money here and there
Until she had no had no more to spare
The doctors theyd done all they could
But their medicine would do no good
When she touched Him the Savior didnt see
But still he turned around and cried Somebody touched me
She said It was I who just wanna touch the hem of your garment
I know Ill be made whole right now
She stood there cryin Oh  Oh Lord  Oh  Oh Lord 
And oh oh Lord and whoa Lord  Oh Lord 
Said If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know Ill be made whole right now
