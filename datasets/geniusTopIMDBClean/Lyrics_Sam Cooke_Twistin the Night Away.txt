Let me tell you about a place
Somewhere up a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twisting the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Putting trouble on the run
Man you find the old and young
Twisting the night away
Theyre twistin twistin
Everybodys feeling great
Theyre twistin twistin
Theyre twistin the night away
Heres a man in evening clothes
How he got here I dont know but
Man you oughta see him go
Twisting the night away
Hes dancing with a chick in slacks
Shes moving up and back
Oh man there aint nothing like
Twisting the night away
Theyre twistin twistin
Everybodys feeling great
Theyre twistin twistin
Theyre twistin the night
Lets twist a while
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
Theyre twistin the night away


Heres a fella in blue jeans
Dancing with an older queen
Whos dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twisting the night away
Man you oughta see her go
Twisting to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twisting the night away
Theyre twistin twistin man
Everybodys feeling great
Theyre twistin twistin
Theyre twistin the night
One more time
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
