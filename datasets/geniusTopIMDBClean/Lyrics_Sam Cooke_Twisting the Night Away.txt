Let me tell you bout a place
Somewhere upa New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twistin the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Puttin trouble on the run
Man you find the old and young
Twistin the night away
Theyre twistin twistin
Everybodys feelin great
Theyre twistin twistin
Theyre twistin the night away
Heres a man in evening clothes
How he got here I dont know but
Man you oughta see him go
Twistin the night away
Hes dancin with a chick in slacks
Shes movin up and back
Oh man there aint nothin like
Twistin the night away
Theyre twistin twistin
Everybodys feelin great
Theyre twistin twistin
Theyre twistin the night
Lets twist a while
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
Theyre twistin the night away
Heres a fella in blue jeans
Dancin with an older queen
Whos dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twistin the night away
Man you oughta see her go
Twistin to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twistin the night away

Theyre twistin twistin man
Everybodys feelin great
Theyre twistin twistin
Theyre twistin the night
One more time
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
