Dont know much about history
Dont know much biology
Dont know much about a science book
Dont know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
Dont know much about geography
Dont know much trigonometry
Dont know much about algebra
Dont know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be
Now I dont claim to be an A student
But Im trying to be
For maybe by being an A student baby
I can win your love for me
Dont know much about history
Dont know much biology
Dont know much about a science book
Dont know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
