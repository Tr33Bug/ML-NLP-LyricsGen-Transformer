You Send Me Lyrics[Chorus]
Darling, you send me
I know you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
Honest you do, whoa-oh

[Verse 1]
You thrill me
I know you, you, you thrill me
Darling you, you, you, you thrill me
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But woo, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home, whoa-oh

I know you send me
Honest you do

I know, I know, I know, when you hold me
(You send me)
Whoa-oh, whenever you kiss me
