Made for me 
You were made for me 
A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sail on the sea
As sure as there are stars above
I know I know you were made for me
You were made for me
A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above
I know I know you were made for me mmhmm
Well have our quarrels and youll upset me
But what can I do Mmm
Youve been mine ever since I met you
And Ill never leave you
No Ill never leave you
As sure as theres a heaven up above me
From you I know Ill never be free
As sure as there are stars above
I know I know you were made for me
A fish was made to swim in the ocean 
A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sail on the sea

As sure as there are stars above
I know I know you were made for me
You were made for me 
You were made for me
A grape was made to grow on a vine 
A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree

As sure as there are stars above

Well have our quarrels and youll upset me
