You you you
Im in love with you you you
I could be so true true true
To someone like you you you
Do do do
What you ought to do do do
Take me in your arms please do
Let me cling to you you you
We were meant for each other
Sure as heavens above
We were meant for each other
To have to hold and to love
You you you
Theres no one like you you you
You could make my dreams come true
If you say you love me too
Oh oh do do do
What you ought to do do do
Take me in your arms please do
Let me cling to you you you
We were meant for each other
Sure as heavens above
We were meant for each other
To have to hold and to love


Oh oh you you you
Theres no one like you you you
You could make my dreams come true
If you say you love me too
Mmm you you you
Im in love with you
