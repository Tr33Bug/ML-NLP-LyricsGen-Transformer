Youre always my mind
Instilled in my heart
Youre always on my mind
Although we are apart
Youre always always
Always on my mind
Baby the reason why I know
I cant forget your face
Cause everywhere I go
I see you everyplace
Youre always always
Always on my mind
Life is so empty
Along with a broken heart
Please please tell me
Honey why did we have to part
You know its you I love
To my heart you hold the key
I pray the stars above
That you hurry back to me
Youre always always
Youre always on my mind
