Youre only 29 got a lot to learn
But when your business  mummy  dies she will not return
We make  like  noise its our choice its what we wanna do
We dont care about long hairs i dont wear flares
See my face not a trace no reality
I dont work i just speed thats all i need
Im a lazy sod
Say youre lazy
Im a lazy sod
I cant even be bothered
Lazy
