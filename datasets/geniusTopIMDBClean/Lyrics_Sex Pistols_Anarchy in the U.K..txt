Anarchy in the UK Lyrics
Right now
I am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
Dont know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passersby
Cause I I wanna be anarchy
No dogsbody
Anarchy for the UK its coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme
Cause I I wanna be anarchy
In the city
How many ways to get what you want
I use the best I use the rest
I use the NME
I use anarchy
Cause I I wanna be anarchy
Its the only way to be
Is this the MPLA
Or is this the UDA
Or is this the IRA
I thought it was the UK
Or just another country
Another council tenancy
I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
Know what I mean
And I wanna be anarchist
I get pissed destroy
