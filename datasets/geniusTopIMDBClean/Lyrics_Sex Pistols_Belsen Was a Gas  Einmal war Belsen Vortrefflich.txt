Belsen was a gas I heard the other day
In the open graves where the jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear
Oh dear
Sergeant majors on the march
Wash their bodies in the starch
See them all die one by one
Guess its dead guess its glad
Belsen was a gas I heard the other day
In the open graves where the jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear
Oh dear
Be a man Be a man
Belsen was a gas
Be a man kill someone
Kill yourself be a man
Be someone kill someone
Be a man kill yourself
