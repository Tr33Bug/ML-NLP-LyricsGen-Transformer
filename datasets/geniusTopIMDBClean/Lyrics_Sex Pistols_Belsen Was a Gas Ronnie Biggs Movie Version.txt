Belsen Was a Gas  Ronnie Biggs Movie Version  Lyrics
Ok this time for real
Belsen Was A Gasser
Belsen was a gas I heard the other day
In the open graves where the Jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear
Oh dear oh dear oh dear
Dentist search their teeth for gold
Frisk the Jews for bank notes rolled
When they found out what they got
Line them up and shoot the lot
Kill a man be a man kill a man
Wonder what the Jews would say
If I told them where Boorman was today
Would they start a vendetta
Youd better ask Ernie Ledbetter
Ledbetter Ledbetter Ledbetter
