Ooh ooh ooh
Shes all geared up
Walking down the street
I can feel her slime
Dripping down her teeth
Well you cant refuse
And you just cant choose
What shes gonna do
I said you cant refuse
And you just cant choose
What shes gonna do
Ooh ooh ooh
Its late at night
And Im all alone
I can hear her boots
Getting nearer home
Well you just cant refuse
And you just cant choose
What shes gonna do
I said you cant refuse
And you just cant choose
What shes gonna do
Well scratch scratch
Shes clawing at the door
Oh no I cant take anymore
Crack crack
I feel so sore
I never should have asked for
Black leather black leather
You can try to hide
You know you wont get far
You will let her in
And shell start again
Well you cant refuse
And you just cant choose
What shes gonna do
I said you cant refuse
And you just cant choose
What shes gonna do
Well scratch scratch
Shes clawing at the door
Oh no I cant take anymore
Crack crack
I feel so sore
I never should have asked for
Black leather black leather
Black leather black leather
