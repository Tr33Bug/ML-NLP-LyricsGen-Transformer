Bodies  Remastered Version  LyricsShe was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree
She was a no one who killed her baby
She sent the letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace
Body
Im not an animal
Body
Im not an animal
Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in the lavatory
Die little baby screaming
Body
Screamin fucking bloody mess
Its not an animal
Its an abortion
Body Im not an animal
Mummy Mummy Mummy Im not an abortion
Throbbing squirm
Gurgling bloody mess
Im not a discharge
Im not a nurseing protein
Im not a throbbing squirm
Fuck this and fuck that
Fuck it all and fuck
The fucking brat
She dont wanna baby that looks like that
I dont wanna baby that looks like that
Body
Im not no animal
Body
An abortion

Body
Im not an animal
Body
Im not an animal
An animal
Im not an animal
Im not an animal an animal an animal an animal no no I aint no animal
Im not a body
Im not an animal an animal an animal an animal no no I aint no animal
Im not an animal
Mummy
