She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree
She was a noone who killed her baby
She sent her letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace
Body Im not an animal
Body Im not an animal
Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
Die little baby screaming
Body screaming fucking bloody mess
Not an animal
Its an abortion
Body Im not an animal
Mummy Im not an abortion
Throbbing squirm
Gurgling bloody mess
Im not a discharge
Im not a loss in protein
Im not a throbbing squirm ugh
Fuck this and fuck that
Fuck it all and fuck the fucking brat
She dont want a baby that looks like that
I dont want a baby that looks like that
Body Im not an animal
Body an abortion


Body Im not an animal
Body Im not an animal
An animal
Im not an animal
Im not an animal an animal Im not an animal I aint no animal
Im not a body
Im not an animal an animal animal
Im not an animal
Mummy
