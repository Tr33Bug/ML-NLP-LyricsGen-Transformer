She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree
She sent her letters from the country
She was an noone who killed her baby
She was an animal
Body Im not an animal
Body Im not an animal
Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
It was killed for a minor fee
And it died
A screaming blood body
Not a squirm squelch
A gurgling bloody mess
Body Im not an animal
