Well come on everybody and lets get together tonight
I got some money in my jeans
And Im really going to spend it right
Well Ive been doing my homework all week long
Now to have some fifty and my folk are gone
Ooh Come on everybody
Well my babys number one
But Im going to dance with three or four
And the house will be shaking from the bare feet
Astamping on the floor
Well when you hear the music and you cant still
If your brother wont rock then your sister will
Ooh Come on everybody
Well were really going to party
But we got to leave a guard outside
If my folks come home
Im afraid theyre going to have my hide
Well thered be no more movies for a week or two
No more running round with the usual crew  who cares
Come on everybody
