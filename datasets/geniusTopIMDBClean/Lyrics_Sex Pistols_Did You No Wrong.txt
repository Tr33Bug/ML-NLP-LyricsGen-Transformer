I dont mind the things that you say
I dont even mind going out of my way
I try and do these things for you
Why should I do it Im always untrue
Well I did you no wrong
I did you no wrong
Going out of my head
I havent seen you off the screen
But those films are my dreams
And I cant take much more of you
Because the bog is no place to see your face
Oh cant you see Im out of my head
Oh cant you see Im a little insane
Oh cant you see going out of my head
Oh cant you see Im really dead
