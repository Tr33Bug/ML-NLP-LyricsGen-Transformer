Dont Give Me  No Lip  Child  Lyrics  x3 
Dont you give me no lip child
Dont you talk back to me
Youre no lip child
That aint the way its going to be
If you want to love true true loving
Youd better stop
Pushing and ashoving pushing and ashoving
Dont you give me no lip child
And I mean what I say
No lip child
Or youll be someone dead
Breaking out of my loving
Youd better stop
Pushing and ashoving 
No more lip
Dont you give me no lip child
Dont you talk back to me
Youre no lip child
That aint the way its going to be
If you want to love true true loving
Youd better stop
Pushing and ashoving pushing and ashoving
Dont you give me no lip child
And I mean what I say
No lip child
Or youll be someone dead
Breaking out of my loving
Youd better stop
Youll be sorry 
No more lip


No lip
