Theres unlimited supply
And there is no reason why
I tell you it was all a frame
They only did it cos of fame
Who
EMI
EMI
EMI
Too many people had the suss
Too many people support us
An unlimited amount
Too many outlets in and out
Who
EMI
EMI
EMI
And sir and friends are crucified
A day they wished that we had died
We are an addition
We are ruled by none
Never ever ever ever
And you thought that we were faking
That we were all just money making
You do not believe were for real
Or you would lose your cheap appeal
Dont you judge a book just by the cover
Unless you cover just another
And blind acceptance is a sign
Of stupid fools who stand in line
Like
EMI
EMI
EMI hahaha
Unlimited edition
With an unlimited supply
That was the only reason
We all had to say goodbye
Unlimited supply  EMI 
There is no reason why  EMI 
I tell you it was all a frame  EMI 
They only did it cos of fame  EMI 
I do not need the pressure  EMI 
I cant stand those useless fools  EMI 
Unlimited supply  EMI 
Hello EMI
Goodbye AM
