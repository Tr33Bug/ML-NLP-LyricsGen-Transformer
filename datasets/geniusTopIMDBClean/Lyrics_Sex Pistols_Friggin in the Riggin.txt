It was on the good ship Venus
By Christ you should have seen us
The figurehead was a whore in bed
And the mast a mammoth penis
The Captain of this lugger
He was a dirty bugger
He wasnt fit to shovel shit
From one place to another
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
Captains name was Morgan
By Christ he was a gorgon
Ten times a day sweet tunes hed play
With his fucking organ
The first mates name was Cooper
By Christ he was a trooper
He jerked and jerked until he worked
Himself into a stupor
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
The second mate was Andy
By Christ he had a dandy
Till they crushed his cock on a jagged rock
For cumming in the brandy
The cabin boy was Flipper
He was a fucking nipper
He stuffed his ass with broken glass
And circumcised the skipper


Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
The Captains wife was Mabel
To fuck she wasnt able
So the dirty shits they nailed her tits
Across the barroom table
The Captain had a daughter
Who fell in deep sea water
And by her squeals we knew the eels
Had found her sexual quarters
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
Frigging in the rigging
There was fuck all else to do
