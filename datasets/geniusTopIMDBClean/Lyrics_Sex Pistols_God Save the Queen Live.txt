God Save the Queen  Live  LyricsGod save the queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
A potential H bomb
God save the queen
She aint no human being
And there is no future
In Englands dreaming
Dont be told what you want
And dont be told what you need
Theres no future no future
No future for you
God save the queen
We mean it man
We love our queen
God saves
God save the queen
Cause tourists are money
And our figurehead
Is not what she seems
Oh God save history
God save your mad parade
Oh Lord God have mercy
All crimes are paid
When theres no future how can there be sin
Were the flowers in the dustbin
Were the poison in your human machine
Were the future your future
God save the queen
We mean it man
We love our queen
God saves
God save the queen
We mean it man
And theres no future
In Englands dreaming
No future
No future
No future for you
No future
No future
No future for me
No future
No future
No future for you
No future
No future for you
