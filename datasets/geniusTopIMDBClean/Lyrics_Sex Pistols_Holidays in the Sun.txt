A cheap holiday in other peoples misery
I dont wanna holiday in the sun
I wanna go to the new Belsen
I wanna see some history
Cause now I got a reasonable economy
Oh now I got a reason now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and Im still waiting
Now I got a reason now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall
In Sensurround sound in a twoinch wall
I was waiting for the communist call
I didnt ask for sunshine and I got World War III
Im looking over the wall and theyre looking at me
Now I got a reason now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and Im still waiting
Now I got a reason now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall
Theyre staring all night and theyre staring all day
I had no reason to be here at all
And now I got a reason its no real reason
And Im waiting at Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
I dont understand this bit at all
Im gonna go over and over the Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
Im gonna go over the Berlin Wall
Claustrophobia theres too much paranoia
Theres too many closets oh when will we fall
And now I got a reason its no real reason to be waiting
At Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the wall
I dont understand this bit at all
This thirdrate Bmovie show
Cheap dialogue cheap essential scenery
I gotta go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall
Before they come over the Berlin Wall
I dont understand this bit at all
I gotta go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the Berlin Wall
Before they come over the Berlin Wall
I dont understand this bit at all
Please dont be waiting for me
