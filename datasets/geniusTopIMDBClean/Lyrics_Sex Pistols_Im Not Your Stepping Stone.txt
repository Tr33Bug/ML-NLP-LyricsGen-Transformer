Im Not Your  Stepping Stone Lyrics
I I I I Im not your stepping stone 
Youre trying to make your mark in society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
Youre reading about your payday in your magazines
The clothes youre wearing girl
Are causing public scenes
I I I I Im not your stepping stone 
Not your stepping stone 
When I first met you girl you didnt had no shoes
Now youre walking round like youre front page news
Youve been awful careful bout the friends you choose
But you wont find my name in your book of Whos Who
I I I I Im not your stepping stone 
Not your stepping stone
Im not stone
Im not rock
I I I I Im not your stepping stone 
Youre trying to make your mark in society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
Youre reading about your payday in your magazines
The clothes youre wearing
Are causing public scenes
I I I I Im not your stepping stone
