Im left in misery
The girl I loves gone across the sea
Im all alone
I aint got no home
Mandy was her name
Sleeping was her game
She didnt care about me
Oh God baby cant you see
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
I need her tender touch
Oh I need it oh so much
I cant forget
Im so upset
I wonder where shes gone
I wonder where she went wrong
I want to get her back to me
But I think shes tired of me
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Every time I think of her
It brings back memories
I remember how it used to be
Oh baby cant you see
Oh baby come back to me
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy


Oh my darling cant you see
Youre the one that means so much to me
I know I need youre tender touch
Oh I need it oh so much
I cant wait to fill your crotch
Oh what a crotch
I cant wait to fuck it
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
Im a lonely boy
