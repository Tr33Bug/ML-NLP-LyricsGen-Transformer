An imitation from New York
Youre made in Japan from cheese and chalk
Youre hippy tarts hero
Cause you put on a bad show you put on a bad show
Dont it show
Still out on those pills
Do you remember
You think its swell playing Maxs Kansas
Youre looking bored and acting flash
With nothing in your gut you better
Keep yer mouth shut
You better keep yer mouth shut
Youre in a rut
Still out on those pills
Do you remember
Four years on you still look the same
I think about time
You changed your brain
Youre just a pile of shit
Youre coming to this
Ya poor little faggot
You seal with a kiss
Do you remember
Think its swell playing in Japan
Everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
Youre just a pile of shit
Youre coming to this
You poor little David
You seal it with a kiss
Still out on those pills
Condemned
Still looking for a kiss
A kiss a kiss
Looking for a kiss
Four years on and youre still the same
I think about time you changed your brain
Think about time you changed your name
A kiss
Looking for a kiss
Looking for that kiss
Looking for the same old kiss
