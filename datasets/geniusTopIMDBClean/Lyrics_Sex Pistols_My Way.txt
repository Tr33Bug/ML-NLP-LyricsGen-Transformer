And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
You cunt Im not a queer
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
And each and every highway
And that much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
Ive planned each charted course
Each careful step along the highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
There were times
Im sure you knew
When there was fuck fuck
Fuck all else to do
But through it all
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced em all and the world
And did it my way
Ive loved and been a snide
Ive had my fill uh
My share of losing
And now the tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I killed a cat
And might I say
Not in the die way
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a brat
What has he got
When he wears hats
And he cannot
Say the things he truly feels
But only the words
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I fucked no bloke
And did it my way
