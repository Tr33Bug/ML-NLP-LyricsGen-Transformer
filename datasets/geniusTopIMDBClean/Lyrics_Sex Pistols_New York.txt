An imitation from New York
Youre made in Japan from cheese and chalk
Youre hippy tarts hero cos you put on bad show
You put on bad show oh dont it show
Still oh out on those pills
Oh do you remember
Think it is well playing Maxs Kansas
Youre looking bored and youre acting flash
With nothing in your gut you better keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut in a rut
Still out on those pills
Do the sambo
Youre four years on you still look the same
I think about time you changed your brain
Youre just a pile of shit youre coming to this
You poor little faggot youre sealed with a kiss
Kiss me
Think its well playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
Youre just a pile of shit youre coming to this
You poor little faggot youre sealed with a kiss
Still out on those pills
Cheap thrills Anadins Aspros anything youre condemned
To eternal bullshit
Youre sealed with a kiss
Kiss me


A kiss a kiss youre sealed with a kiss
A looking for a kiss youre coming to this
I wanna kiss
You do just about anything
Oh kiss this
Tatty bye
