Ive seen you in the mirror when the story began
And I fell in love with you I love your mortal sin
Your brains are locked away but I love your company
I only ever leave you when you got no money
I got no emotions for anybody else
You better understand Im in love with myself myself
In love with myself
No feeling no feeling
Ive no feeling for anybody else
Hello and goodbye in a run around sue
You follow me around like a pretty pot of glue
I kick you in the head you got nothing to say
Get out of the way cos I gotta get away
You never realise I take the piss out of you
You come up and see me and Ill beat you black and blue
All day Ill send you away
No feeling Ive got no feeling
Ive no feeling for anybody else
Except for myself in love with myself
My beautiful self
There aint no moonlight after midnight
I see you stupid people out looking for delight
And Im so happy feeling so fine
Watching all the rubbish wasting my time
Look around your house and you got nothing to steal
I kick you in the head when you get down to kneel
And pray you pray your god
No feeling Ive got no feeling
Ive no feeling for anybody else
No feeling no feeling
No feeling for anybody else
God has gone away
Be back another day
See his picture hanging on your wall
