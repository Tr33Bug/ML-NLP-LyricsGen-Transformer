God save the queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
Potential bomb
God save the queen
Shes not human being
There is no future in Englands dreaming
Dont be told what you want dont be told what you need
No future theres no future no future for you
God save the queen
God save window leen
God save human beings
God save the queen tourists are money
And our figure head is not what she seems
God save history God save your mad parade
Lord God have mercy all crimes are paid
Were the flowers in the dustbin
Were the poison in your human machine
Were the future your future
God save the queen we mean it man
We love our queen God saves
God save the queen tourists are money
And our figure head is not what she seems
No future for you no future for you
No future no future for me
No future no future for you
No future no future for me
No future no future for you
