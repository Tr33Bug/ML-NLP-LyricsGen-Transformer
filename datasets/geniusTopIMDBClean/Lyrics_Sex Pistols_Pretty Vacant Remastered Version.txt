Pretty Vacant  Remastered Version  LyricsTheres no point in asking youll get no reply
Just remember I dont decide
I got no reason its all too much
Youll always find us out to lunch
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty vacant
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty vacant
Dont ask us what were doing cause were not all there
I dont pretend cause I dont care
I dont believe illusions cause too much aint for real
Stop your cheap comments cause we know what we feel
Were pretty pretty vacant
Were pretty pretty vacant
Now and we dont care
Theres no point in asking youll get no reply
Just remember I dont decide
I got no reason its all too much
Youll always find me out to lunch
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty vacant
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty vacant
Now and we dont care
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
And we dont care
