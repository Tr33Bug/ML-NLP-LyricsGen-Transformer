Theres no point in asking youll get no reply
Oh just remember I dont decide
I got no reason its all too much
Youll always find us out to lunch
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
Were vacant
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
A vacant
Dont ask us to attend cause were not all there
Oh dont pretend cause I dont care
I dont believe illusions cause too much aint for real
Stop your cheap comments cause we know what we feel
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
Were vacant
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
A vacant
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
And now
And we dont care
Theres no point in asking youll get no reply
Oh just remember I dont decide
I got no reason its all too much
Youll always find me out to lunch
Were out at lunch
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
Were vacant
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
Were vacant
Oh were so pretty oh so pretty
And now
And we dont care
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
Were pretty
A pretty vacant
And we dont care
