Too many problems oh why am I here
I need to be me cause youre all too clear
And I can see theres something wrong with you
What do you expect me to do
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Dont come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely You got no one
You got your body in suspension
Thats a problem
Problem
Problem
The problem is you
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You dont do what you want then youll fade away
You wont find me working nine to five
Its too much fun being alive
Im using my feet for my human machine
You wont find me living for the screen
Are you lonely All needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated
Problem
Problem
Problem
The problem is you
What you gonna do
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
The problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you
Problem
I aint equipment I aint automatic
You wont find me just staying static
Dont you give me any order
To people like me there is no order
Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought youd solved all your problems
But you are the problem
Problem
Problem
Problem
The problem is you
What you gonna do with your problem
Ill leave it to you
Problem the problem is you
You got a problem
What you gonna do
They know a doctor gonna take you away
Theyll take you away and theyll throw away the key
They dont want you and they dont want me
You got a problem the problem is you
Problem what you gonna do
Problem oh you got a problem
Problem oh you got a problem
Problem problem
