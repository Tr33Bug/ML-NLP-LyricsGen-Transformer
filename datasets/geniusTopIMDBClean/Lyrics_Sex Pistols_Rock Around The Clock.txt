One two three oclock four oclock rock
Five six seven oclock eight oclock rock
Nine ten eleven oclock twelve oclock rock
Were going to rock around the clock tonight
Put your glad rags on and join me hon
Well have some fun when the clock strikes one
Were going to rock around the clock tonight
Were going to rock rock rock til broad daylight
Were going to rock going to rock around the clock tonight
When the clock strikes two three and four
If the band slows down well yell for more
When the chimes ring five six and seven
Well be right in seventh heaven
When its eight nine ten eleven too
Ill be going strong and so will you
When the clock strikes twelve well cool off then
Start a rocking round the clock again
