Suburban kid you got no name
Two ton e  baby and you got no brain
I bet youre only happy in suburbian dreams
But Im only laughing cause you arent in my scheme
Hey baby
I love you
I love you
I love you
I only ever listen when youre on the phone
From your safety where you sit at home
When I got nothing better to do
Then there is always you
Because youre good for my shoe
Hey babe
I love you
I love you
I love you
Im in love
Yeah in love
Oh cant you feel it
No I dont like where you come from
Its just a satellite of London
And when you look me in the eye
Just remember that I want to die
Hey babe
I love you
I love you
I love you
Youre the name but you cant tell
Looking like you just came out to hell
How did you figure thatd youd any use
All youre going to get is my abuse
