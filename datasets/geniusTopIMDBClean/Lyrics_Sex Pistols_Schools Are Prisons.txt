They took the best years of my life
And made it so I couldnt decide
I dont turn this want
To make beautiful word that goes on and on
And on and on
Those 13 years in prison
Didnt teach me how to love
They say they have their reasons
All coming from above
You can forget the seasons inside your factory
Theres one thing they cant teach you is how to feel free
And stand alone in a beautiful world
We have to respond
Schools are prisons
Forget the seasons
Schools are prisons
Schools are one of the reasons for this waste of the spring
And where to begin
Outside or within
It took the best years of my life
And made it so I couldnt decide
Statistic as in prisons
Statistic as in life
Schools are prisons
Forget the seasons
Schools are prisons
One of the reasons
Schools are prisons
Forget the seasons
Schools are prisons
One of the reasons for this waste of the spring
