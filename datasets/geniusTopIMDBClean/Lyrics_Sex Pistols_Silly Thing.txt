What you see you cant get
Nothings free nothings set
Dont be fooled by the signs
Dont read in between the lines
What youre going to say
What youre going to do
Now youve missed out once again
But I thought you knew
Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
Trouble here trouble there
People stop just to stare
Whats the use of wasting time
Just move on leave em all behind
What youre going to say
What youre going to do
Now youve missed out once again
But I thought you knew
Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
Oh you silly thing
Nothing but trouble that you bring
One of these days youre gonna die
And people will say Oh my oh my
And people will say Oh my my my my


Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
Oh you silly thing
Youve really gone and done it now
