Look at that
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One of the cutest since I dont know when
But she dont notice me when I pass
She goes with all the guys from out of my class
But that cant stop me from thinking to myself
Shes sure fine looking man shes something else
Look at that
Across the street
Theres a car built just for me
To own a car would be a luxury
But right now I cant afford the gas
A brand new convertible is out of my class
But that cant stop me from thinking to myself
That cars fine looking man its something else
Hey look at that
Just wait and see
Worked hard and saved my dough
I buy that car and then I roll up with Joe
Get me that girl and we go riding around
We look real sharp with the wide top down
I keep on dreaming and thinking to myself
When it all comes true wow man thats something else
Hey look at that
Whats all this
Never thought Id do this before
But here Im aknocking on her door
My cars out front and its all mine
Its a 41 job not a 59
I got that girl and Im thinking to myself
Shes sure fine looking man wow shes something else
