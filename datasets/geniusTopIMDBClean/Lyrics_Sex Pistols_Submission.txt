Im on a submarine mission for you baby
I feel the way you were going
I picked you up on our TV screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing
Submission
Going down down dragging her down
Submission
I cant tell ya what Ive found
Youve got me pretty deep baby
I cant figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
Youre sitting it out in Heaven above
Submission
Going down down dragging me down
Submission
I cant tell ya what Ive found
For theres a mystery
Under the sea underwater
Come share it
Submission
Going down down dragging her down
Submission
I cant tell ya what Ive found
Cos its a secret
Under the water under the sea
Octopus Rock
Got me pretty deep baby
I cant figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
Youre sitting it out in Heaven above
Submission
Going down down youre dragging her down
Submission
I cant tell ya what Ive found
Submission
Submission
Going down down under the sea
I wanna drown drown under the water
Going down down under the sea
