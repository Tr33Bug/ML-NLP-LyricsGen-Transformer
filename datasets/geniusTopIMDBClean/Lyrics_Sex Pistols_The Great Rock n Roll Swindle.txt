People said we couldnt play
They called us foulmouthed yobs
But the only notes that really count
Are the ones that come in wads
They all drowned when the air turned blue
Cause we didnt give a toss
Filthy lucre isnt nothing new
But we all get cash from the chaos
The time is right to do it now
The greatest rock and roll swindle
The time is right to do it now
EMI said you are out of hand
And they gave us the boot
But they couldnt sack us just like that
Without giving us the loot
Thank you kindly A  M
They said we were out of bounds
But that isnt bad for two weeks work
And 75000 pounds
I just want to play with my band
Are you good enough for me
Hiya boys Im the chosen one
Cant you fucking see
Im a jealous god and I want everything
And I love you with a knife
Ill take you if youre ready for me
And Ill give you my life
The time is right for Nickeys Special
The greatest rock and roll star
The time is right for me now
I kill
Elvis Presley died in 1959
Chuck Berry youre a big ugly fucker
Ian Dury Cockney Fraud
Mick Jagger white nigga
Bob Dylan got a parking ticket stuck to his arsehole
David Bowie you are a bloody cunt
Malcolm Mc
Rod Stewarts got a luggage label tied to his tonsils
Elton John hair transplant
Sid Vicious Rock and Roll Clich
Paul Cook bare bones
Johnny Rottenah his days are even numbered
Rock and roll swindle
Swindle
Its a swindle
