Gentle pretty thing
Who only had one spring
You bravely faced the world
Ready for anything
Im happy that you lived
For your life is mine
What have I except to cry
Spirit never die
Birds of the air
Beasts of the earth
Overjoyed at Bambis birth they gambolled in the glade
Who killed Bambi 
Murder murder murder
Someone should be angry
The crime of the century
Who shot little Bambi
Never trust a hippie
Because I love punky Bambi
Ill kill to find the killer
In that rotten roll army
All the spikey punkers
Believers in the ruins
With one big shout
They all cry out
Who killed Bambi
