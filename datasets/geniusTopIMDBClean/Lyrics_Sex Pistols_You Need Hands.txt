You need hands to hold someone you care for
When you fear nobody wants to know you
You need hands to brush away the tears
When you hold the brand new baby
You need tender hands to guide them all the way
You need hands to thank the Lord for living
And forgiving us this day
You need hands to show the world youre happy
And you need hands when you have to stop the bus
But the hands that we love so dear
Are the hands that we love to hear
Are the hands that You give to us
Everybody holds the hands that You give to us
