Time time time
See whats become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
But look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
Its bound to be a better ride
Than what youve got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around you
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Hang on to your hopes my friend
Thats an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
Its the springtime of my life
Ahhh seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Wont you stop and remember me
At any convenient time
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Look around
Leaves are brown
Theres a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
Theres a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
Theres a patch of snow on the ground
