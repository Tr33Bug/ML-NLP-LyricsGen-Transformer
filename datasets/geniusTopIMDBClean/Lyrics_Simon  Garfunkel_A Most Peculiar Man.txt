He was a most peculiar man
Thats what Mrs Riordan says
And she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man
He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone
Within a house
Within a room
Within himself
A most peculiar man
He had no friends
He seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
Cause he wasnt friendly and he didnt care
And he wasnt like them
Oh no he was a most peculiar man
He died last Saturday
He turned on the gas
And he went to sleep
With the windows closed
So hed never wake up
To his silent world
And his tiny room
And Mrs Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon
And all the people said
What a shame that hes dead
But wasnt he a most peculiar man
