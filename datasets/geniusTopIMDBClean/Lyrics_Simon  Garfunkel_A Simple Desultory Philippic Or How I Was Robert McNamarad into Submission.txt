A Simple Desultory Philippic  Or How I Was Robert McNamarad into Submission  Lyrics
I been Norman Mailered Maxwell Taylored
I been John OHarad McNamarad
I been Rolling Stoned and Beatled til Im blind
I been Ayn Randed nearly branded
Communist cause Im lefthanded
Thats the hand I use well never mind
I been Phil Spectored resurrected
I been Lou Adlered Barry Sadlered
Well I paid all the dues I want to pay
And I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce
And all of my wealth wont buy me health
So I smoke a pint of tea a day
I knew a man his brain so small
He couldnt think of nothing at all
Not the same as you and me
He doesnt dig poetry
Hes so unhip when you say Dylan
He thinks youre talking about Dylan Thomas
Whoever he was
The man aint got no culture
But its alright Ma
Everybody must get stoned
I been Mick Jaggered been silver daggered
Andy Warhol wont you please come home
I been mothered fathered aunt and uncled
Been Roy Haleed and Art Garfunkeled
I just discovered somebodys tapped my phone
Folk rock 
Ive lost my harmonica Albert
