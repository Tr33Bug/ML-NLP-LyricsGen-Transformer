April come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June shell change her tune
In restless walks shell prowl the night
July she will fly
And give no warning to her flight
August die she must
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
September Ill remember
A love once new has now grown old
