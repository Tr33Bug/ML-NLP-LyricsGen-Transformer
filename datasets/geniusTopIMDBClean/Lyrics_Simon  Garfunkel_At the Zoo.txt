Someone told me
Its all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe its true
Its a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
But you can take the crosstown bus
If its raining or its cold
And the animals will love it
If you do
If you do now
Something tells me
Its all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe its true
The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but theyre dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum
Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas You gotta come and see
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
