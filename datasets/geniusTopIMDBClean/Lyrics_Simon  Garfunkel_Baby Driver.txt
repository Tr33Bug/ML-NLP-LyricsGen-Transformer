My daddy was the family bassman
My mamma was an engineer
And I was born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears
In my ears
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and Im gone
Whats my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Rmmbababa 
Scoot down the road
Whats my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Shine the light
Woouhhuhh woouhhuhh woouhhuhhdododododododoee weedeededoee
My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mamas in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve
I did not serve
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and Im gone
Whats my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Rmmbababa 
Scoot down the road
Whats my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Baabaabaabaabaabaaaaa

My daddy got a big promotion
My mamma got a raise in pay
Theres noone home were all alone
Oh come into my room and play
Yes we can play
Im not talking about your pigtails
But Im talking bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and Im gone
Whats my number
I wonder how your engines feel
Rmmbababa 
Scoot down the road
Whats my number
I wonder how your engines feel
