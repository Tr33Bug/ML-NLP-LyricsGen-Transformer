Catch a boat to England baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever Ive been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game
Send out for whiskey baby
Send out for gin
Me and room service honey
Me and room service babe
Me and room service
Well were living a life of sin
When I aint drinking baby
You are on my mind
When I aint sleeping honey
When I aint sleeping Mama
When I aint sleeping
Well you know you find me cryin
Catch a boat to England baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever Ive been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game
Living is a gamble baby
Lovings much the same
Wherever I have played
Wherever I throw those dice
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game
Maybe when Im older baby
Someplace down the line
Ill wake up older
So much older Mama
Wake up older
And Ill just stop all my tryin
Catch a boat to England baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever Ive been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same
