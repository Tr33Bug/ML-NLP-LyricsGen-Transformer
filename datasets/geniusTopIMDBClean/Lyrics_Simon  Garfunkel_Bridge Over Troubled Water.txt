When youre weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
Im on your side oh
When times get rough
And friends just cant be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When youre down and out
When youre on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
Ill take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine oh
If you need a friend
Im sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
