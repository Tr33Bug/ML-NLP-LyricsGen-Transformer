Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby
With someone new
She sure looks happy
I sure am blue
She was my baby
Till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance
That might have been
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Im through with romance
Im through with love
Im through with counting
The stars above
And heres the reason
That Im so free
My loving baby
Is through with me


Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
