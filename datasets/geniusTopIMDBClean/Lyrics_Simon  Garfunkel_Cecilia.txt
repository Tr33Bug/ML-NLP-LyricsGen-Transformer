Cilia youre breaking my heart
Youre shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees
Im begging you please to come home
Cilia youre breaking my heart
Youre shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees

Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom  making love 
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someones taken my place

Im begging you please to come home
