Cilia youre breaking my heart
Youre shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees
Im begging you please to come home
Cilia youre breaking my heart
Youre shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees
Im begging you please to come home
Come on home
Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom  making love 
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someones taken my place
Cilia youre breaking my heart
Youre shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia Im down on my knees
Im begging you please to come home
Come on home
