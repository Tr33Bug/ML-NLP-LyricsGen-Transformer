Cloudy
The sky is gray and white and cloudy
Sometimes I think its hanging down on me
And its a hitchhike a hundred miles
Im a ragamuffin child
Pointed finger painted smile
I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while
Cloudy
My thoughts are scattered and theyre cloudy
They have no borders no boundaries
They echo and they swell
From Tolstoy to Tinker Bell
Down from Berkeley to Carmel
Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill
Hey sunshine
I havent seen you in a long time
Why dont you show your face and bend my mind
These clouds stick to the sky
Like a floating question why
And they linger there to die
They dont know where they are going and my friend neither do I
Cloudy
Cloudy
