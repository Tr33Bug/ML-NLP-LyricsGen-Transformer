El Condor Pasa  If I Could  Lyrics
Id rather be a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would
Id rather be a hammer than a nail
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would
Away Id rather sail away
Like a swan thats here and gone
A man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world
Its saddest sound
Its saddest sound
Id rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would
Id rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would
