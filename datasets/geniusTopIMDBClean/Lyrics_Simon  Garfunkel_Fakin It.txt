When she goes shes gone
If she stays she stays here
The girl does what she wants to do
She knows what she wants to do
And I know Im fakin it
Im not really makin it
Im such a dubious soul
And a walk in the garden
Wears me down
Tangled in the fallen vines
Picking up the punch lines
Ive just been fakin it
Not really makin it
Is there any danger
No no not really
Just lean on me
Taking time to treat
Your friendly neighbors honestly
Ive just been fakin it fakin it
Not really makin it
This feeling of fakin it
I still havent shaken it
Prior to this lifetime
I surely was a tailor look at me
Good morning Mr Leitch
Have you had a busy day 
I own the tailors face and hands
I am the tailors face and hands
I know Im fakin it fakin it
Im not really makin it
This feeling of fakin it
I still havent shaken it shaken it
I know Im fakin it
Im not really makin it
