Through the corridors of sleep
Past shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion
I dont know what is real
I cant touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion
So Ill continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall
The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But Im not sure at all its my reflection
Im blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction
So Ill continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall
No matter if youre born
To play the king or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn tween joy and sorrow
So my fantasy
Becomes reality
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow
So Ill continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall
