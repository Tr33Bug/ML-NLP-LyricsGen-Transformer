He was my brother
Five years older than I
He was my brother
Twentythree years old the day he died
Freedom rider
They cursed my brother to his face
Go home outsider
This towns gonna be your buryin place
He was singin on his knees
An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong
He was my brother
Tears cant bring him back to me
He he was my brother
And he died so his brothers could be free
He died so his brothers could be free
