Im sittin in the railway station
Got a ticket for my destination mmm
On a tour of one night stands
My suitcase and guitar in hand
And every stop is neatly planned
For a poet and a one man band
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thoughts escaping
Home where my musics playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Everydays an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines Mmm
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every strangers face I see
Reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thoughts escaping
Home where my musics playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Tonight Ill sing my songs again
Ill play the game and pretend mmm
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thoughts escaping
Home where my musics playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Silently for me
