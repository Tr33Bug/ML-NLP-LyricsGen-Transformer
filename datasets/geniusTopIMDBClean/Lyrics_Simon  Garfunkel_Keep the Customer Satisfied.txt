Gee but its great to be back home
Home is where I want to be
Ive been on the road so long my friend
And if you came along
I know you couldnt disagree
Its the same old story yeah
Everywhere I go
I get slandered libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And Im one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied
Deputy Sheriff said to me
Tell me what you come here for boy
You better get your bags and flee
Youre in trouble boy
And now youre heading into more
Its the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And Im one step ahead of the shoeshine
Two steps away from the county line
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied
And its the same old story
Everywhere I go
I get slandered libeled
I hear words I never heard in the Bible
And Im so tired
Im oh so tired
But Im trying to keep my customers satisfied
Satisfied
