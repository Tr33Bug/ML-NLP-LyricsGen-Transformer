Mrs Robinson Lyrics
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
And heres to you Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo wo wo
God bless you please Mrs Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Wed like to know a little bit about you for our files
Wed like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home
And heres to you Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo wo wo
God bless you please Mrs Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
Its a little secret just the Robinsons affair
Most of all youve got to hide it from the kids
Coo coo cachoo Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Wo wo wo
God bless you please Mrs Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it shout about it
When youve got to choose
Every way you look at it you lose
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
Woo woo woo
Whats that you say Mrs Robinson
Joltin Joe has left and gone away
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
