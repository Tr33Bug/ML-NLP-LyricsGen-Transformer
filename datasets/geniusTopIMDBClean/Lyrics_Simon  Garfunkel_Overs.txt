Why dont we stop fooling ourselves
The game is over over over
No good times no bad times
Theres no times at all
Just The New York Times
Sitting on the windowsill
Near the flowers
We might as well be apart
It hardly matters
We sleep separately
And drop a smile passing in the hall
But theres no laughs left
Cause we laughed them all
And we laughed them all
In a very short time
Time
Is tapping on my forehead
Hanging from my mirror
Rattling the teacups
And I wonder
How long can I delay
Were just a habit
Like saccharin
And Im habitually feelin kinda blue
But each time I try on the thought of leaving you
I stop
Stop and think it over
