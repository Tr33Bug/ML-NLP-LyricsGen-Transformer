Wish I was a Kelloggs Cornflake
Floatin in my bowl takin movies
Relaxin awhile livin in style
Talkin to a raisin who casionly plays LA
Casually glancing at his toupee
Wish I was an English muffin
Bout to make the most out of a toaster
Id ease myself down
Comin up brown
I prefer boysenberry more than any ordinary jam
Im a Citizens for Boysenberry Jam fan
Ah South California
If I become a first lieutenant
Would you put my photo on your piano
To Maryjane
Best wishes Martin
Old Roger draftdodger
Leavin by the basement door
Everybody knows what hes
Tippytoeing down there for
Oh really
