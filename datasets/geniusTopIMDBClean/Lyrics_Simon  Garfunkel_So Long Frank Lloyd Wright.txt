So long Frank Lloyd Wright
I cant believe your song is gone so soon
I barely learned the tune
So soon
So soon
Ill remember Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights wed harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long
Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view
When I run dry
I stop awhile and think of you
Architects may come and
Architects may go and
Never change your point of view
So long Frank Lloyd Wright
All of the nights wed harmonize till dawn
I never laughed so long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long
So long already Artie 
So long
So long
