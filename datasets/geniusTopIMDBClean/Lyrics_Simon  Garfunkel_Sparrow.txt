Who will love a little Sparrow
Whos traveled far and cries for rest
Not I said the Oak Tree
I wont share my branches with no sparrows nest
And my blanket of leaves wont warm her cold breast
Who will love a little Sparrow
And who will speak a kindly word
Not I said the Swan
The entire idea is utterly absurd
Id be laughed at and scorned if the other Swans heard
And who will take pity in his heart
And who will feed a starving sparrow
Not I said the Golden Wheat
I would if I could but I cannot I know
I need all my grain to prosper and grow
Who will love a little Sparrow
Will no one write her eulogy
I will said the Earth
For all Ive created returns unto me
From dust were ye made and dust ye shall be
