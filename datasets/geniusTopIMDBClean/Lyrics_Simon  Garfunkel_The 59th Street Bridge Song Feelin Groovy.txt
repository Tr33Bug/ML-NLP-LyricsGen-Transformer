The 59th Street Bridge Song  Feelin Groovy  Lyrics
Slow down you move too fast
You got to make the morning last
Just kicking down the cobblestones
Looking for fun and feelin groovy
Ba da ba da ba da ba da  feelin groovy
Hello lamppost whatcha knowing
Ive come to watch your flowers growing
Aint cha got no rhymes for me
Dootin doodoo feelin groovy
Ba da ba da ba da ba da  feelin groovy
Ive got no deeds to do no promises to keep
Im dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me
Life I love you
All is groovy
