I am just a poor boy though my storys seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest hmm
When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station runnin scared laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Asking only workmans wages I come lookin for a job
But I get no offers
Just a comeon from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there la la la la la la la
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than Ill be thats not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
And Im laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin home
Where the New York City winters arent bleedin me
Leadin me
Goin home
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving but the fighter still remains
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie lie la lie la lie la lie la la lie la lie
I love you
