Tom get your plane right on time
I know your partll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Dandadandandada and here I am
The only living boy in New York
I get the news I need on the weather report
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report
Hey Ive got nothing to do today but smile
Dandadandadandada and here I am
The only living boy in New York
Half of the time were gone
But we dont know where
And we dont know where
Aaah aaah aaah

Half of the time were gone
But we dont know where
And we dont know where
Tom get your plane right on time
I know that youve been eager to fly now
Hey let your honesty shine shine shine now

The only living boy in New York

Aaah aaah aaah
