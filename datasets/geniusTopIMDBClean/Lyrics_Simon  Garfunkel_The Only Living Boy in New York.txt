Tom get your plane right on time
I know your partll go fine
Fly down to Mexico
Dandadandandada and here I am
The only living boy in New York
I get the news I need on the weather report
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report
Hey Ive got nothing to do today but smile
Dandadandadandada and here I am
The only living boy in New York
Half of the time were gone
But we dont know where
And we dont know where
Aaah aaah aaah
Here I am
Half of the time were gone
But we dont know where
And we dont know where
Tom get your plane right on time
I know that youve been eager to fly now
Hey let your honesty shine shine shine now
Dandadandadandada
Like it shines on me  Here I am 
The only living boy in New York
The only living boy in New York
Aaah aaah aaah

Aaah aaah aaah
