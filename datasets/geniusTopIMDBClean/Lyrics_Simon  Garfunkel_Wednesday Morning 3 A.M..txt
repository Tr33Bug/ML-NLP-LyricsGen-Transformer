Wednesday Morning 3 AM Lyrics
I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love
As she lies here beside me asleep with the night
And her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow
Reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight
She is soft she is warm but my heart remains heavy
And I watch as her breasts gently rise gently fall
For I know with the first light of dawn Ill be leaving
And tonight will be all I have left to recall
Oh what have I done Why have I done it
Ive committed a crime broken the law
For twentyfive dollars and pieces of silver
I held up and robbed a hard liquor store
My life seems unreal my crime an illusion
A scene badly written in which I must play
Yet I know as I gaze at my young love beside me
The morning is just a few hours away
