Follow me Ill lead the way
Your fears will soon overtake
Hide your infinite tears inside
It seeks your smallest break
Screaming as if nothing helps
You press on to survive
Playing out the fantasies
Of a force that keeps you alive
Ill have you down on your knees
Youll play my fatal game
Ill satisfy your every need
Youll never be the same
Aaaaah
Take my hand Ill show you how
Youve just one life to live
The road youre on goes straight to hell
Your life is yours to give
His fantasies of all of you
Are much too great to see
This world your living is so unreal
Perfected just for me
Ill have you down on your knees
Youll play my fatal game
Ill satisfy your every need
Youll never be the same
Ill have you down on your knees
Youll play my fatal game
Ill satisfy your every need
Youll never be the same
