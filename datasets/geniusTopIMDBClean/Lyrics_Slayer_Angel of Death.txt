Ah
Auschwitz the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life
Forced in like cattle you run
Stripped of your lifes worth
Human mice for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Sadistic surgeon of demise
Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying without mercy
To benefit the Aryan race
Surgery with no anesthesia
Feel the knife pierce you intensely
Inferior no use to mankind
Strapped down screaming out to die
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death
Pumped with fluid inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins
Pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin
Your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozenwater burial
Sewn together joining heads
Just a matter of time
Till you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The Holocaust
Seas of blood bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wideawake nightmare
Wings of pain reach out for you
His face of death staring down
Your bloods running cold
Injecting cells dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants hes creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free
Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death
Angel of death
