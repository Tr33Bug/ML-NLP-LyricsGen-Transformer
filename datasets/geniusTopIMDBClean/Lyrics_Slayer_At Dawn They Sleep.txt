Awakened I have become
Light now slips away
Manipulate your mind
Darkness is my slave
Taste the sins of Hell
The blood that I so crave
The last thing that you see
Is the hunger in my eyes
Bloodsucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparitions from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust the secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood
At dawn they sleep
Unveil the hidden coffin
Lift the lid of terror
Feel the deadly cold
Freeze you from inside
Perceiving your intentions
To slay the phantom form
Raise the stake in malice
You cannot plunge it down
Bloodsucking creatures of the night
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light
Cries screaming out every fright
Eagerly awaiting plight
Apparitions from the pits of Hell
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell
Demented lust the secrets they must keep
Addicted to your blood
At dawn they sleep


Beware the image unseen
Stalks your soul
Your corpses redeem
Eternal damnation your just reward
A servant of our Lord
By your accord
Admonish of the cruciform
Impalement
Immortalitys scorned
Rise hold fast your faith
To lie dormant
Is certain death
Driven by the instinct of
Centuries of horror  Kill kill 
Implanted along the brain  Kill kill 
Of the sickening parasite  Kill kill 
Linked together by one trait  Kill kill 
The hellful need to kill  Kill kill 
Kill  Kill  kill  Kill  kill  Kill  kill  Kill kill 
Emerging from their hellish tomb
Taking flight amidst the night
The evening skies are raining death
Swooping down from shadowed skies
Taking simple human form
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man
Lock their jaws into your veins
Satanic soldiers strike their prey
Leaving corpses waiting for the change
Blood dripping from the jaws of death
Not enough to satisfy
They must drain your soul of life
