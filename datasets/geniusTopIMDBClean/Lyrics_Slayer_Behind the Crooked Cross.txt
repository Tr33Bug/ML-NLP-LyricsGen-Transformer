Time melts away in this living inferno
Trapped by a cause that I once understood
Feeling a sickness building inside of me
Who will I really have to answer to
March on through the rivers of red
Souls drift they fill the air
Forced to fight behind
The crooked cross
Do only what is expected of me
With no emotions my feelings suppressed
Blind obedience carries me through it all
Conscience a word I learned to forget
March on through the rivers of red
Souls drift they fill the air
Forced to fight behind
The crooked cross
Time melts away in this living inferno
Trapped by a cause that I once understood
Blind obedience carries me through it all
Do only what is expected of me
March on through the rivers of red
Souls drift they fill the air
Forced to fight behind
The crooked cross
