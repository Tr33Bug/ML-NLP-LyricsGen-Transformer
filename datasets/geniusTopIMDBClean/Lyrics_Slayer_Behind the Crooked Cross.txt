Behind the Crooked Cross Lyrics[Verse 1]
Time melts away in this living inferno
Trapped by a cause that I once understood
Feeling a sickness building inside of me
Who will I really have to answer to?

[Chorus]
March on through the rivers of red
Souls drift, they fill the air
Forced to fight behind
The crooked cross
[Verse 2]
Do only what is expected of me
With no emotions, my feelings suppressed
Blind obedience carries me through it all
"Conscience," a word I learned to forget

[Chorus]
March on through the rivers of red
Souls drift, they fill the air
Forced to fight behind
The crooked cross

[Verse 3]
Time melts away in this living inferno
Trapped by a cause that I once understood
Blind obedience carries me through it all
Do only what is expected of me

[Chorus]
March on through the rivers of red
Souls drift, they fill the air
Forced to fight behind
The crooked crossYou might also likeEmbed
