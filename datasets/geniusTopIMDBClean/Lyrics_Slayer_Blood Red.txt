Peaceful confrontation meet war machine
Seizing all civil liberties
Honest ballotation among banshee
Spilling blood on humanity
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
The massacre of innocent people
Deviated lies fear blinds your eyes
Enforcing their truth through a gun
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Thousands of people cannot be wrong
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
Stains the primitive sickle
Blood red
Growing opposition with words as ammunition
Expressions of lifes liberties
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control
Spilling blood throughout humanity
You cannot hide the face of death
Oppression ruled by bloodshed
No disguise can deface evil
Stains the primitive sickle
Blood red
