Eternal the kiss I breathe
Siphon your blood to me
Feel my wounds of your God
Forever rape mortality
I smell of death I reek of hate I will live forever
Lost child pay the dead
Bleeding screams of silence
In my veins your eternity
Ill kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth
First breath born come alive learn to kill
Bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
Dark side has no rival test your faith in blood
Night hides the hunting packs a feeding frenzy
Ill kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth
I am the first not the last
Condemned by a single kiss
Betrayed eternally
Ill rip inside your soul
Contaminating the world
Defying God and son
Black heart that brings your death
Living in infamy
Drink the flesh of life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years
Ill kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth
Bleed your death upon me
Bleed your death upon me
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth
Blame Gods chosen children
As you die Im immortal
Faithless no religion
Stalking prey is my confession
Captive blood enslavement
Pain and hunger drives your madness
Drink flesh life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years
