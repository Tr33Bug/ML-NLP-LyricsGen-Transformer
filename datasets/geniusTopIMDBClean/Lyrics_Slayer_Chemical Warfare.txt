Frantic minds are terrified
Life lies in a grave
Silent death rides high above
On the wings of revelation
Multideath from chemicals
Arrogance has won
Annihilation must be swift
Destroy without destruction
Gods of the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the land where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
Chemical warfare
Artificial fucking peace
Line up in death row
Generals in their slow defeats
Diminish from this hell
Banished from the dying world
The lords of hell await
Dogs of war are helpless prey
To immortality
Gods of the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the land where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
Chemical warfare
Fuck it up
Liquidate
The torture kills the troops that try to fight
Terminate
Human pesticide bring days of doom
Mist falls
The deadly gas that brings them to their knees
Sacrifice
Steal the soul and send his corpse to hell


Mummified regions lying in dust
Fall victim to this game
Petrified corpses bathing in rust
Taken without being blamed
Falsified spirits farther they fall
Soon they will join us in hell
See the sky burning the gates are ablaze
Satan waits eager to merge
Gods of the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant no life
Rising new souls on the land where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
Chemical warfare
