Night will come and I will follow
For my victims no tomorrow
Make it fast your time of sorrow
On his trail Ill make you follow
Quarters for the criminally insane
The sentence read for life I must remain
The path I chose has led me to my grave
To try again Id have no other way
Quarters for the criminally insane
Escape for me has fast become a game
Soon to be Ill leave without a trace
Endangered species end the human race
Branded in pain marked criminally insane
Locked away and kept restrained
Disapprobation but what have I done
I have yet only just begun
To take your fuckin lives
Night will come and I will follow
For my victims no tomorrow
Make it fast your time of sorrow
On his trail Ill make you follow
