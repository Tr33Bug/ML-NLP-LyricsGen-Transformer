Oppression is the holy law
In God I distrust
In time His monuments will fall
Like ashes to dust
Is war and greed the master plan
The Bibles where it all began
Its propaganda sells despair
And spreads the virus everywhere
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religions obscene
Religions a whore
The pestilence is Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
Ive made my choice Sixsixsix
Corruption breeds the pedophile
Dont pray for the priest
Confession finds the lonely child
God preys on the weak
You think your soul can still be saved
I think youre fuckin miles away
Scream out loud heres where you begin
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religions obscene
Religions a whore
The targets fucking Jesus Christ
I wouldve led the sacrifice
And nailed him to the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
Ive made my choice Sixsixsix
Jesus is pain
Jesus is gore
Jesus is the blood
Thats spilled in war
Hes everything
Hes all things dead
Hes pulling on the trigger
Pointed at your head
Through fear youre sold into the fraud
Revelation revolution
I see through your Christ illusion
The war on terror just drags along
My war with God is growing strong
His propaganda sells despair
And spreads the violence everywhere
Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape
Religions obscene
Religions a whore
There is no fuckin Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility
Ive made my choice Sixsixsix
