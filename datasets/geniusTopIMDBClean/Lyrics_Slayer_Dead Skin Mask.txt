How Ive waited for you to come
Ive been here all alone
Now that youve arrived
Please stay awhile
And I promise I wont keep you long
Ill keep you forever  Forever forever forever 
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead cold flesh appease the means
Provoking images delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptations lost all control
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants
In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants
Dance with the dead in my dreams  Hello Hello Mr Gein 
Listen to their hallowed screams  Mr Gein 
The dead have taken my soul  Let me out of here Mr Gein 
Temptations lost all control  Mr Gein I dont want to play anymore Mr Gein 
Dance with the dead in my dreams  Mr Gein this isnt fun anymore 
Listen to their hallowed screams  I dont wanna play anymore Mr Gein 
The dead have taken my soul  Mr Gein I want out of here Mr Gein 
Temptations lost all control  Let me out now
