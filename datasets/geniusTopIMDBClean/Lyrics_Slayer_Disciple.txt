Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
Ill instigate Ill free your mind
Ill show you what Ive known all this time
God hates us all God hates us all
You know its true God hates this place
You know its true He hates this race
Homicide suicide
Hate heals you should try it sometime
Strive for peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
I know why your prayers will never be answered
God hates us all God hates us all
God hates us all God hates us all
Yeah he fuckin hates me
Pessimist terrorist targeting the next mark
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Cutthroat slit your wrist shoot you in the back fair game
Drug abuse selfabuse searching for the next high
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
Im waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies
I never said I wanted to be Gods disciple
Ill never be the one to blindly follow


Manmade virus infecting the world
Selfdestruct human time bomb
What if there is no God Would you think the fucking same
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
Wake the fuck up cant ignore what I say
I got my own philosophy
I hate everyone equally
You cant tear that out of me
No segregation separation
Just me in my world of enemies
I never said I wanted to be Gods disciple
Ill never be the one to blindly follow
Ill never be the one to bear the cross
Disciple
I reject this fuckin race
I despise this fuckin place
I reject this fuckin race
I despise this fuckin place
I reject this fuckin race
I despise this fuckin place
I reject this fuckin race
I despise this fuckin place
