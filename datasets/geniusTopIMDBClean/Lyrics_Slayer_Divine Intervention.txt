Divine Intervention LyricsAwaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place
Why are they haunting me
I cannot look at God's face
Paralysing
Brilliant light
Trying to run
Want to scream, but cannot speak
I cannot look at God's face
Blind my eyes, I cannot see
What is being done to me
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained

Victimized
Specimen
Deathless torture
Void with no mercy
Black shroud blinds those who see

Violated
Naked before you I stand
Shattered shrine of flesh and bone
God's piercing through my soul

Segments of my life
Morbid pieces of reality
Twisted personality
Many faces yet faceless
Familiar things give way to strange
No mercy no reason just pain

Fatal
Sub-conscious control
Threshhold of pain unfolds
Transfixed martyr saving race
Who am I to judge thy grace

I cannot look at God's face
Blind my eyes, I cannot see
What is being done to me
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained1Embed
