Awaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place
Why are they haunting me
I cannot look at Gods face
Paralysing
Brilliant light
Trying to run
Want to scream but cannot speak
I cannot look at Gods face
Blind my eyes I cannot see
What is being done to me
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained
Victimized
Specimen
Deathless torture
Void with no mercy
Black shroud blinds those who see
Violated
Naked before you I stand
Shattered shrine of flesh and bone
Gods piercing through my soul
Segments of my life
Morbid pieces of reality
Twisted personality
Many faces yet faceless
Familiar things give way to strange
No mercy no reason just pain
Fatal
Subconscious control
Threshhold of pain unfolds
Transfixed martyr saving race
Who am I to judge thy grace
Awaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place
Why are they haunting me
I cannot look at Gods face
Blind my eyes I cannot see
What is being done to me
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained
