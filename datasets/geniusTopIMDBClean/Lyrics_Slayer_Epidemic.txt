Breeding fast in poverty
Infectious driving dormant seed
Inside your carcass start to mate
Left in charge to dominate
Waiting to unfold
Raging uncontrolled
Adapt a potency
Death machine infest my corpse to be
Unyielding kings of agony
Test your body chemistry
Pulmonary overthrow
Possession of your inner throne
Infections quickly override
Malicious domineering strike
Floods your veins commit slow death
Deteriorate your makers met
Perpetual demise
On a fast decline
Killing tendency
Epidemic permanent disease
Incapacitate fall into your fate
Pain results in screams
Bleed internally
Years will pass before it can be cured
