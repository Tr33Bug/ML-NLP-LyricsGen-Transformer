Ah
Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing weve lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead
Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds
Satan our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon therell be nothing else left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with Gods angels and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can
Evil
Aah haha
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds
