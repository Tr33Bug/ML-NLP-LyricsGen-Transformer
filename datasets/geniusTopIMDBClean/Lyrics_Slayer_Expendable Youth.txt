Gun down cold on a raw deal
Home turf my battlefield
In no ones way caught in a crossfire
Stray bullets can kill
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution
Injured soul on the hard ground
Head blown off facedown
Lying in a pool of blood
An accidental death homicide
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution
Try and take me you motherfucker
Struggling to survive
This druginduced warfare
Having control
A principal obsession
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Violence is only a friend
Expendable youth
Fighting for possession
Having control
A principal obsession
Rivalry and retribution
Death the only solution
