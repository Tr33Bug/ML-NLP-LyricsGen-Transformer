Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will rise
Once forgotten soldiers come to life
Fallen mercenary dormancy is done
Not content with wars weve never won
Memories cant ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Rise ghosts of war
Target assassinate time of your life has expired
Hatred victimize gaze in their eyes as they die
Violence inflicting of pain savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound arouse the subconscious to lie
Memories cant ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Rise ghosts of war
I deal in pain
All life I drain
I dominate
I seal your fate
I deal in pain
All life I drain
Memories cant ignore
Rise ghost of war
