On your back look on to me
Youll see genocide
Face from death more than insane
Profane pleading cries
Watch you die inside watch you die
God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees
Youre screaming out to die
Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming  out to die 
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me
Putrid blood flows through my veins
To thrive on demise
Voyeurs lust watching the pain
Touching you inside
Bleed you fucking dry
Bleed on me
Deaths design bloodsplattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures flesh from bone
Down on your knees
Youre screaming out
To die
Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming  out to die 
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me
Clawing at the eyes of God
You taste your death in hand
Your fingers bleed in vain
You screamin your grave
Clawing at the eyes of God
You pierce your throat and hands
Youve gone insane with pain
Youre blind screaming for your God
Pathetic God
Deaths design bloodsplattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures
Drown your mind in pain
God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees
Youre screaming out to die
Clawing at the eyes of God
