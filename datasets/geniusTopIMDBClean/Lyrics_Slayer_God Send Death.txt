God Send Death Lyrics[Verse 1]
On your back, look on to me
You'll see genocide
Face from death, more than insane
Profane, pleading cries
Watch you die inside, watch you die

[Chorus 1]
God send death, end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin, a shattered faith
Down on your knees
You're screaming out to die
[Post-Chorus]
Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming (out to die)
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

[Verse 2]
Putrid blood flows through my veins
To thrive on demise
Voyeurs' lust watching the pain
Touching you inside
Bleed you fucking dry
Bleed on me

[Chorus 2]
Death's design, blood-splattered wall
Face melting, one vicious whore
Twisted figures, flesh from bone
Down on your knees
You're screaming out
To die
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming (out to die)
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

[Bridge]
Clawing at the eyes of God
You taste your death in hand
Your fingers bleed in vain
You screamâ€”in your grave
Clawing at the eyes of God
You pierce your throat and hands
You've gone insane with pain
You're blind, screaming for your God
Pathetic God

[Lead - Hanneman]

[Chorus 3]
Death's design, blood-splattered wall
Face melting, one vicious whore
Twisted figures
Drown your mind in pain
[Chorus 1]
God send death, end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin, a shattered faith
Down on your knees
You're screaming out to die

[Outro]
