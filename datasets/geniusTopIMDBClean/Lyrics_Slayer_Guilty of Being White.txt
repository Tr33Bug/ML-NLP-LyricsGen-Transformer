Guilty of Being White Lyrics[Verse]
I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
I lynched somebody
But I don't know who
You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years
Before I was born

[Chorus]
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
[Verse]
I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
I lynched somebody
But I don't know who
You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years
Before I was born

[Chorus]
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White

[Bridge]
I'm convicted
Of a racist crime
I've only served
Nineteen years of my time

[Verse]
I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
I lynched somebody
But I don't know who
You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years
Before I was born
You might also like[Chorus]
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being rightEmbed
