Im sorry
For something I didnt do
I lynched somebody
But I dont know who
You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years
Before I was born
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Im sorry
For something I didnt do
I lynched somebody
But I dont know who
You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years
Before I was born
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Im convicted
Of a racist crime
Ive only served
Nineteen years of my time
Im sorry
For something I didnt do
I lynched somebody
But I dont know who
You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years
Before I was born


Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being White
Guilty of being right
