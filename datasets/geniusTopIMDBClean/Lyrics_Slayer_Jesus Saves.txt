You go to the church you kiss the cross
You will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality Christianity
You spend your life just kissing ass
A trait thats grown as time has passed
You think the world will end today
You praise the Lord thats all you say
Jesus saves
Listen to you pray
You think youll see the pearly gates
When Death takes you away
For all respect you cannot lust
In an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency
Eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies
Depopulate satanic rise
You will be an accessory
Irreverence and blasphemy
Jesus saves
No need to pray
The gates of pearl have turned to gold
It seems youve lost your way
Jesus saves
No words of praise
No Promised Land to take you to
There is no other way
