Jihad Lyrics[Verse 1]
I have witnessed your death
I've seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrepit little mind
A father's son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall

[Chorus 1]
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die again for Him
[Verse 2]
God won't touch what I've done
He cries upon my feet
A privileged pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged in fear
Await the coming of the God

[Chorus 2]
I will watch you die again for Him

[Verse 3]
Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquer divide within
Terrorize the mind
I've seen the end, it's yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh, it melts
Spilling from the sky

[Chorus 3]
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die

This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war

[Verse 4]
War of holy principles
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heathen man
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead

[Verse 5]
Fuck your God, erase his name
A lady weeps, insane with sorrow
I'll take his towers from the world
You're fuckin' raped upon your deathbed

[Hook]
This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war
Fucking holy war
[Lead - Hanneman and King]

[Outro]
Be optimistic, happy, and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors
Your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For it's a point of no return for Almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servants
When you reach ground zero, you will have killed the enemy
