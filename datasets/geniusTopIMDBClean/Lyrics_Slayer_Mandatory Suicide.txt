Murder at your every footstep
A childs toy sudden death
Sniper blazes you through your knees
Falling down can you feel the heat
Burn
Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head
Offspring sent out to cry
Living mandatory suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Holes burn deep in your chest
Raked by machine gun fire
Screaming soul sent out to die
Living mandatory suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Suicide
Lying dying screaming in pain
Begging pleading bullets drop like rain
Mines explode pain shears through your brain
Radical amputation this is insane
Flyswatter stakes drive through your chest
Spikes impale you as youre forced off the crest
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath
A vile smell like tasting death
Dead bodies dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass bits of clothing and human deceit
Dying in terror
Bloods cheap its everywhere
Mandatory suicide massacre on the front line

Burn
