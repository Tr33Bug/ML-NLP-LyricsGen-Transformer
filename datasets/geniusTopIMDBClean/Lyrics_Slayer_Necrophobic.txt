Necrophobic Lyrics[Verse 1]
Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation from a mind deranged
Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair

[Refrain]
Ripping apart, severing flesh
Gouging eyes, tearing limb from limb

[Verse 2]
Experimentation, slow infection, internal decay
Execution, need transfusion, body rots away
Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine
[Refrain]
Ripping apart, severing flesh
Gouging eyes, tearing limb from limb

[Bridge]
Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain
Limb dissection, amputation from a mind deranged
Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair
Sliced incision, zero vision, loss of vital signs
Skin contortion, bone erosion, your life becomes your fine

[Outro]
Necrophobic, can't control the paranoia
Scared to dieYou might also like1Embed
