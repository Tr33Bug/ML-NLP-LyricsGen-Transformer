You need to take a closer look at me
Cause I was born to be the thorn in your side
No matter what you think youre gonna see
You never wanted this barrage of fucking pride
You dont want none of me
Youve got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
When you draw first blood you cant stop this fight
For my own peace of mind Im going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till youre just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall now youre nothing
Paybacks a bitch motherfucker
You only live to be a parasite
Your life must suck when nothings going your way
Everything melts away before your eyes
Youre just a punk that doesnt have the sense to get away
Get the fuck away
Youve got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
When you draw first blood you cant stop this fight
For my own peace of mind Im going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till youre just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall now youre nothing
Now youre nothing
Paybacks a bitch motherfucker
I will never become your fucking scapegoat
I dont know how it feels to come up short
I only want vengeance
To come shining down on me
I dont want you to die
Before I get the chance to kill you myself
Youve got a fucking catheter in your brain
Pissing your common sense away
This is for the mindfuck
This is for the hell of it
This is for me Im going to
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till youre just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall now youre nothing
Tear your fucking eyes out
Rip your fucking flesh off
Beat you till youre just a fucking lifeless carcass
Fuck you and your progress
Watch me fucking regress
You were made to take the fall now youre nothing
Now youre nothing
You aint fucking shit
