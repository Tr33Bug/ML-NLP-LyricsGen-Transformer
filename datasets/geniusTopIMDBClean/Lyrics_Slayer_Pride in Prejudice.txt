Pride in Prejudice Lyrics[Verse 1]
You made your choice
I'll take my stand
Your life story
In my bloodstained hands

[Chorus 1]
Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedents
[Verse 2]
Abuse of power, civil unrest
Money in blood is of no significance
Inner rage waiting to ignite
Blood of the innocent unites

[Verse 3]
I'm right; you're wrong
In number, I'm strong
Violence is proof enough that I am

[Chorus 1]
Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedents

[Verse 4]
Martial law, a militant state
Barrel of a gun seals your fate
Fire burns with media hype
Speak the truth through your own lies

[Lead â€“ King]

[Chorus 2]
Pride in prejudice
Don't give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedents
Pride in prejudice
Don't give me your bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot killed the innocent
You might also like[Outro]
Some love to hate
Right in your face
Violence will facilitate
Fuel the fire with racial slurs
And see who kills the other firstEmbed
