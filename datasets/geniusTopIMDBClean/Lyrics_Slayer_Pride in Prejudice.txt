You made your choice
Ill take my stand
Your life story
In my bloodstained hands
Pride in prejudice
Dont give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedents
Abuse of power civil unrest
Money in blood is of no significance
Inner rage waiting to ignite
Blood of the innocent unites
Im right youre wrong
In number Im strong
Violence is proof enough that I am
Pride in prejudice
Dont give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedents
Martial law a militant state
Barrel of a gun seals your fate
Fire burns with media hype
Speak the truth through your own lies
Pride in prejudice
Dont give me that power bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot sets the precedents
Pride in prejudice
Dont give me your bullshit
Pride in prejudice
One gunshot killed the innocent


Some love to hate
Right in your face
Violence will facilitate
Fuel the fire with racial slurs
And see who kills the other first
