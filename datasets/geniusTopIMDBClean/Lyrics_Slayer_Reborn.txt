Convicted witch my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured by lock inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
These shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time
Incantation spell gone by
Ill see life again
My deals were made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing theres no end
I will be reborn
No gift of exile in my fate
Ill get no amnesty
I cant control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die
You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
Therell be nowhere for you to run
When hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no firstborn
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn
Count your blessing wouldbe priest
As I burn upon the stake
Youd be forgiven endlessly
But your values are all fake
Forever servant of my Lord
By choice and not submission
Maybe now Ive made you wonder
Am I superstitious
Incantation spell gone by
I will live again
My deals were made eternally
I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again
And burning the next morn
Death means nothing theres no end
I will be reborn
