Reborn Lyrics[Verse 1]
Convicted witch, my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured, by lock, inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
These shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time

[Chorus]
Incantation spell gone by
I'll see life again
My deals were made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there's no end
I will be reborn
[Verse 2]
No gift of exile in my fate
I'll get no amnesty
I can't control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die

[Chorus]
You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run
When hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no firstborn
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Verse 3]
Count your blessing, would-be priest
As I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly
But your values are all fake
Forever servant of my Lord
By choice and not submission
Maybe now I've made you wonder
Am I superstitious?
You might also like[Chorus]
Incantation spell gone by
I will live again
My deals were made eternally
I signed the book in red
My rage will be unleashed again
And burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there's no end
I will be reborn
