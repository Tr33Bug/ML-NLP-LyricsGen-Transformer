Arrogance violence world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fuckin day
I hate the life hate the fame hate the fuckin scene
Pissing match of egos fuck their vanity
Aint got the time I dont want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin do
No looking back no regrets no apologies
What you get is what you see
Live fast on high
Repentless let it ride
My songs relive the atrocities of war
Cant take society any fuckin more
Intensity anarchy hatred amplified
Playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
I leave it all on the road living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it every day
So take your shot bottoms up this is no lie
Ill be beating this guitar till the day I die
Live fast on high
Repentless let it ride
I hate the life hate the fame hate the fuckin scene
Pissing match of egos fuck their vanity
Aint got the time I dont want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fuckin do
No looking back no regrets no apologies
What you get is what you see
Were killing ourselves a little more every day
Live fast on high
Repentless let it ride
