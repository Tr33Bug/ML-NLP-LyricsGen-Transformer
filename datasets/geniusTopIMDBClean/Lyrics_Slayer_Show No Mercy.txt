Through the night we rise in pairs
Lords of night we ride
From the depths of Hells domain
Reborn to reign this night
Roam throughout the endless wars
Hold high his name we must
Warriors from the gates of Hell
In Lord Satan we trust
Stalking the night cant you feel I am near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing their fates
Brothers of the prince of night
By bargains we have made
Allies with the darkened souls
Our legions we must save
Fight for our eternal quest
God cant save you in time
Evil stalks the night with us
Your soul it shall be mine
Stalking the night cant you feel I am near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing my force
I am the menace in your eyes
The one you cant escape
Your life falls in my grasp
You know your end is near
You pray your God will help
His strength no match for mine
Your last hope slips away
Thy soul begins to bleed
I tear your flesh to shreds
Burn holes throughout your mind
Your eyes now filled with blood
A victim of my force
In endless agony
You realize your defeat
Recite my masters chants
Your soul now his to keep
Stalking the night cant you feel I am near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing their fates
