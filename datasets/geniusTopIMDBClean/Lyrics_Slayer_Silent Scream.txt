Nightmare the persecution
A childs dream of death
Torment ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest
Guidance it means nothing
In a world of brutal time
Electric circus wild
Deep in the infants mind
Silent scream
Bury the unwanted child
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn
Shattered another child
Bearer of no name
Restrained insane games
Suffer the children condemned
Scattered remnants of life
Murder a time to die
Pain sufferaged toyed
Lifes little fragments destroyed
Silent scream
Crucify the bastard sons
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn
Life preordained
Humanity maintained
Extraction termination
Pains agonizing stain
Embryonic death
Suffocation strangulation
Death is fucking you insane
Nightmare the persecution
A childs dream of death
Torment ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest
Innocence withdrawn in fear
Fires burning can you hear
Cries in the night
