Silent Scream Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death
Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest
Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time
Electric, circus, wild
Deep in the infant's mind

[Chorus]
Silent scream
Bury the unwanted child
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn
[Verse 2]
Shattered, another child
Bearer of no name
Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned
Scattered, remnants of life
Murder, a time to die
Pain, sufferaged, toyed
Life's little fragments destroyed

[Chorus]
Silent scream
Crucify the bastard sons
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn

[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Bridge]
Life preordained
Humanity maintained
Extraction, termination
Pain's agonizing stain
Embryonic death
Embedded in your brain
Suffocation, strangulation
Death is fucking you insane
You might also like[Verse 1]
Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death
Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest

[Outro]
Innocence withdrawn in fear
Fires burning, can you hear
Cries in the night?2Embed
