Skeletons of Society Lyrics[Verse 1]
Minutes seem like days
Since fire ruled the sky
The rich became the beggars
And fools became the wise
Memories linger in my brain
Burning from the acid rain
A pain I never have won

[Verse 2]
Nothing here remains
No future and no past
No one could foresee
The end that came so fast
Hear the prophet make his guess
That paradise lies to the west
So join his quest for the sun
[Chorus]
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Verse 3]
The world slowly decays
Destruction fills my eyes
Harboring the image
Of a spiraling demise
Burning winds release their fury
Simulating judge and jury
Drifting flurries of pain

[Verse 4]
Deafening silence reigns
As twilight fills the sky
Eventual supremacy
As daylight waits to die
Darkness always calls my name
A pawn in this recurring game
Humanity going insane

[Pre-Chorus]
Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
You might also like[Chorus]
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of society

[Verse 5]
Minutes seem like days
Corrosion fills the sky
Morbid dreams of anarchy
Brought judgment in disguise
Memories linger in my brain
Life with nothing more to gain
Perpetual madness remains

[Pre-Chorus]
Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society

[Chorus]
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of societyEmbed
