An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
Judgment Day the Second Coming arrives
Before you see the light you must die
Forgotten children conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
Neverending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat
Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with young incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
A neverending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
