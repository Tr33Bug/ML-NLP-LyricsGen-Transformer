South of Heaven Lyrics[Intro]
An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
Judgment Day, the Second Coming arrives
Before you see the light, you must die

[Verse 1]
Forgotten children conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
Never-ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality
[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

[Verse 2]
Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with young incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Sustained by immoral observance, a domineering deity

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath

[Chorus]
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven

[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
A never-ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

[Chorus]
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]13Embed
