Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end
Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstonefire wall
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living hall
Brokenglass reflections
Show your flesh eaten away
Beyond the gates Ill take you
Where the blood forever rains
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end
Afterlife confessions
Tell me who you used to be
Looking on in wonder
As I show you it was me
Burning from within
You know one spark is all it takes
Hear the piercing cries of all
Who found that hell awaits
Living nightmare cant you see
You really have no choice
Faded memories haunt you
Listen closely to my voice
Feed me all your hatred
Empty all your thoughts to me
I can fill your emptiness
With immortality
Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity
