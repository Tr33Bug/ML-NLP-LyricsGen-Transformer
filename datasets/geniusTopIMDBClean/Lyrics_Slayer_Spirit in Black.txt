Spirit in Black Lyrics[Verse 1]
Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternity

[Chorus]
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath, you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end
[Verse 2]
Spirits damned to rot
Amidst the brimstone-fire wall
Eyes of the dead
Watching from their living hall
Broken-glass reflections
Show your flesh eaten away
Beyond the gates, I'll take you
Where the blood forever rains

[Chorus]
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath, you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end

[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]

[Chorus]
Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath, you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black till the end

[Verse 3]
Afterlife confessions
Tell me who you used to be
Looking on in wonder
As I show you it was me
Burning from within
You know one spark is all it takes
Hear the piercing cries of all
Who found that hell awaits
You might also like[Verse 4]
Living nightmare, can't you see?
You really have no choice
Faded memories haunt you
Listen closely to my voice
Feed me all your hatred
Empty all your thoughts to me
I can fill your emptiness
With immortality

[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my world
Involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life
Just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time
At past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno
Enthroned for eternityEmbed
