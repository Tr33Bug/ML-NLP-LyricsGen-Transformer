Screams and nightmares
Of a life I want
Cant see living this lie no
A world I haunt
Youve lost all control of my
Heart and soul
Satan holds my future
Watch it unfold
I am the Antichrist
Its what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free
Watching disciples
Of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackals truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasnt come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satans son
Screams
From a life I live
Torment
Is what I give
Torture
Is what I love
The downfall
Of heavens above
I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot
Rot rot
