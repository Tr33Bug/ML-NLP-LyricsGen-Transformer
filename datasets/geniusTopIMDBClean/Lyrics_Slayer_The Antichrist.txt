The Antichrist Lyrics[Verse 1]
Screams and nightmares
Of a life I want
Can't see living this lie, no
A world I haunt
You've lost all control of my
Heart and soul
Satan holds my future
Watch it unfold

[Chorus]
I am the Antichrist
It's what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free
[Verse 2]
Watching disciples
Of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satan's son

[Bridge]
Screams!
From a life I live
Torment
Is what I give
Torture!
Is what I love
The downfall
Of heavens above

[Chorus]
I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally, my soul will rot
Rot, rotYou might also like1Embed
