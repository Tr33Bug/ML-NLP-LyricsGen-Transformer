I dont want to see I dont want to hear
I dont want to feel anything cant you understand
Everything I do doesnt stem from you
It doesnt have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin mind all the fuckin time
Cant control the violence that spews from me
Take it
I cant control the rage that flows from me
I cant shut it down it overwhelms me
I cant stop the rage that flows from me
Cant stop the
Violence I love it
No ones immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
Youre either on my side or else youre in my way
No one stands a chance when Im lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
Its my discipline its my way of life
Never wanted bliss never wanted you
Never needed anyone Ive polluted
Everything you feel everything you are
Everything youll ever be you repulse me
Its always about you you always come at me
With shit I cant identify you know it makes me
Lose my fuckin mind all the fuckin time
Cant control the violence thats spewing from me
Take it


Cant stop the
Violence I love it
No ones immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
Youre either on my side or else youre in my way
No one stands a chance when Im lashing out
Random hate there is no other way
Its my discipline its my way of life
Yeah
I cant stop the rage
I cant stop to hate you
I cant control the violence
