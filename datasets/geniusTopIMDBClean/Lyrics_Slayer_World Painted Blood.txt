Disease spreading death entire population dies
Dead before youre born massive suicide
Vicious game of fear its all extermination now
Poison in your veins global genocide
Slaughter governs law the apocalypse begins
Pain becomes the norm seeking homicide
Beware the coming storm that starts illuminating fires
God is laughing hard man has gone insane
World painted blood no sanctuary
World painted blood no sanctuary
Tip the human scale follow revelations plan
It must come to pass secret shadows lie
Blueprint haunting dreams in which manipulation wins
Speak no hidden fears religion neutralized
Emerged from the dark sadist mercenary ride
Realm not of this world godless messengers
Sickless mindless hate becomes evolutions cure
Planets usher in alignment God has died
World painted blood no sanctuary
World painted blood no sanctuary
God send death
Watch it bleed
Justified
Manufactured lives born in hell
Angels fall
Wings on fire
Crucified
Terrorizing man burn the world
Reflecting eyes
Sickle swings
Wave of blood
Suicidal mind from the start
Endless pain
Open wounds
Slit the throat
Radiation child seeks the throne
Strafing down
Demigods
Certain death
Coming from the stars lord of all
Dark rift rise
Flourish life
Perish man
We destroy ourselves cease to live
Childrens blood
Feed the dead of sea of flesh
Catastrophic fall
Rest in hell
Flaming corpse
Screaming eyes
Watch it die
Walk among the dead pick your grave
Like a disease spreading death
Erasing your existence
Like a disease spreading death
Erasing your existence
Like a disease spreading death
Erasing your existence
Like a disease spreading death
Erasing your existence
Satans hand begins the end
And frees the world forever
Gomorrahs dream to live in sin
Has reached its critical mass
Man himself has become God
And laughs at his destruction
In which we trust a secret government
Is now in total collapse
Disease spreading death entire population dies
Dead before youre born massive suicide
Vicious game of fear its all extermination now
Poison in your veins global genocide
Slaughter governs law the apocalypse begins
Pain becomes the norm seeking homicide
Beware the coming storm that starts illuminating fires
God is laughing hard man has gone insane
World painted blood no sanctuary
World painted blood no sanctuary
Signs of disease rivers red blood in ice plague
Signs of disease rivers red blood in ice plague
Signs of disease rivers red blood
Welcoming our death
