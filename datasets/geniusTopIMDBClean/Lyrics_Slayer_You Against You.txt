I had your back but its no use
False accusations are on the loose
You know what
It makes no sense that you tied your own noose
You never felt the sores decay
Your perfect world is ending today
So what
I wouldnt have it any other way
Is this your paradise
You think you thought this through
Cause when you rolled the dice
The house came down on you
Dont care what you do or say
Your suicide begins today
Have fun in paradise
This hell is just for you
You against you
Shitty time to make a stand
All without a master plan just you
You against you
So hows your paradise
Hindsight just laughs at you
With conflict comes a price
That price weighs heaviest on you
I guess I should say thanks
Dissension in the ranks
You panic lit the fuel
Now its you against you


You against you
Wasnt looking for a fight
But Im showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand
All without a master plan just you
You against you
These seeds are what youve sown
Never should have lit that fuse
Enjoy your paradise
This hell is just for you
You against you
Wasnt looking for a fight
But Im showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand
All without a master plan just you
You against you
