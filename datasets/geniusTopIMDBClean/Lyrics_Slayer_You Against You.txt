You Against You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I had your back, but it's no use
False accusations are on the loose
You know what?
It makes no sense that you tied your own noose
You never felt the sores decay
Your perfect world is ending today
So what?
I wouldn't have it any other way

[Lead – Holt]
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is this your paradise?
You think you thought this through?
'Cause when you rolled the dice
The house came down on you
Don't care what you do or say
Your suicide begins today
Have fun in paradise
This hell is just for you

[Chorus 1]
You against you
Shitty time to make a stand
All without a master plan, just you
You against you

[Verse 2]
So how's your paradise?
Hindsight just laughs at you
With conflict comes a price
That price weighs heaviest on you
I guess I should say thanks
Dissension in the ranks
You panic lit the fuel
Now it's you against you
You might also like[Chorus 2]
You against you
Wasn't looking for a fight
But I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand
All without a master plan, just you
You against you

[Lead – Holt/King]

[Verse 3]
These seeds are what you've sown
Never should have lit that fuse
Enjoy your paradise
This hell is just for you

[Chorus 2]
You against you
Wasn't looking for a fight
But I'm showing up tonight
Shitty time to make a stand
All without a master plan, just you
You against you

[Lead – King]Embed
