Beware  Beware
Beware  The dangers there
Beware  Beware
Seems like love should be easier to bear
But its such a heavy load
Worldwide travelers you aint been nowhere
Till youve traveled down loves road
Although I may be just a stranger
Lovers let me warn you theres the danger
Of a fork in loves road
Beware  Beware
Beware  The dangers there
Beware  Ho ho ho
One way is for those who go alone
That way tempts the fool like me
Oh but lovers dont try to make it on your own
You dont want this misery
Oh oh why didnt I see the sign
Ooh ooh before I left my love behind
At the fork in loves road
Beware  Beware
Beware  The dangers there
Beware  Ho ho ho


If there is something that you dont see eye to eye
You better think before you tell your love goodbye
Cause your paths may never cross again
Ooh make sure you take the same bend
At the fork in loves road
Beware  Beware
Beware  The dangers there
Beware  If you really care
Beware  Ooh oh oh
Beware  Beware
Beware
