Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham
Can you tell me where hes gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and hes gone
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where hes gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and hes gone
Has anybody here seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where hes gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and hes gone
Didnt you love the things they stood for
Didnt they try to find some good in you and me
And well be free
Someday soon its gonna be one day
Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me where hes gone
I thought I saw him walkin up over the hill
With Abraham and Martin and John
