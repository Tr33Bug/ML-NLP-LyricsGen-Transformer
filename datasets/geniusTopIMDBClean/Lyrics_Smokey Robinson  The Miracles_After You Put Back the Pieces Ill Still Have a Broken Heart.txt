After You Put Back the Pieces  Ill Still Have a Broken Heart  LyricsYes you played the part of my true lover
But then you broke my heart
Now youll try in vain to kiss back a dream
That no longer remains
Cause Im tired its true
Of what Im going through
Its better if were apart
After you put back the pieces
Ill still have a broken heart
In playing your games
You broke every promise
And then the heartaches came to us
Although youre tellin me
That youre so sorry
Then you hurt me from the start
After you put back the pieces
Ill still have a broken heart
Oh yes I will
If my love you miss
Then always remember
That you started this
For a heart that is real
If once it is broken
It may never heal
For breaking hearts with you
Is nothing new
With you its just an art I know
After you put back the pieces
Ill still have a broken heart
I know for real

After you put back the pieces
And Ill still have a broken heart
I know I know I know I know
After you put back the pieces
Ill still have a broken heart
