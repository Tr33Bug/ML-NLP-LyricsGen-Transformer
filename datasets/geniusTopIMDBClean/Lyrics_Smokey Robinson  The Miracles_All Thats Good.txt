Say all thats good  All thats good 
Say all thats good  All thats good 
Your lovin wakes me up just like a cup of coffee
And when the gloom is on you take it off me
I walk you to your door and then you kiss me
Before I go a block you say you miss me
And all thats good  All thats good 
All thats good  All thats good 
So good until Im crazy about it
Cant do without it
Dont even think I could
Ooh all thats good  All thats good 
Baby all thats good  All thats good 
Youll do anything you can to show you love me
Everything to show youre thinking of me
Youll leave a little note where I can find it
Do everything you can so Im reminded
That all thats good  All thats good 
All thats good  All thats good 
So good until Im crazy about it
Cant do without it
Dont even think I could
Ah yeah all thats good  All thats good 
All thats good  All thats good 
Let me hear you blow your horn alright
All thats good
All thats good
All thats good
Dont you know that if Romeo and you have met
There never would have been a Juliet
A beauty like yours is so rare
Even Mona Lisa cant compare
And all thats good  All thats good 
All thats good  All thats good 
So good until Im crazy about it I cant do without it
Dont even think I could
Oh yeah all thats good  All thats good 
Oh baby all thats good  All thats good 
Each and every thing about you  All thats good 
To know that I could never do without you  All thats good 
Everything you do and say  All thats good 
Every time you look my way  All thats good 
Oh all thats good  All thats good
