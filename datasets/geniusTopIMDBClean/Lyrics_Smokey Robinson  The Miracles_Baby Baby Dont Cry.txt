Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain
Ooh oohoohoh
Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesnt deserve you
His loss is our gain so dont be blue
cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be yeah
So baby straighten up come on and fly right
Its no catastrophe yeah
I said now baby baby dont cry
Baby baby heres why
Love is here standin by
Love is here standin by
You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of
Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad but you cant be disgusted
Its time that you got readjusted
And realized that tear filled eyes
Can never stop him now no no no
That man is on his way
I think hes gone to stay
You better drop him now yeah
Oowee now baby baby dont cry no no
Baby baby heres why
Because love is here standin by
I say love is here standin by
All youve gotta do is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have got the love you thought you had in him here in me
Love is hope girl love is strength
Heres someone standin right beside ya
Who would go to any length to give you love true and deep
And hope you realize at last you found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep

So baby baby dont cry oh baby dont you cry now
Baby baby dont cry oh baby let me tell you why now
Baby baby heres why dont you know that
Love is here standin by
I say love is here standin by
Your tears are shed in vain I said
So baby baby dont cry cmon dry your eyes
Baby baby dont cry dont you realize
Baby baby heres why
