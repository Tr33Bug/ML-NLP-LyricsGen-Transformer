Ooh 
Ah yeah
Ooh 
Beggars cant be choicey I know
Thats what the people say  People say 
But though my heart is begging for love
Ive turned some love away  Love away 
Oh maybe one was true love
Ill never know which cause
Your love is the only love to make this beggar rich
Im a choosey beggar  choosey beggar 
And youre my choice baby  Youre my choice 
People say you cant have your cake
And then eat it too  Eat it too 
They tell me Ive been making a mistake
Waiting around for you  Around for you 
Oh Im begging for love but
Why cant they see that yours is the only love for me
Cause Im a choosey beggar choosey beggar  Choosey beggar choosey beggar 
And youre my choice baby  Youre my choice 
Say it one more time now  Youre my choice 
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah  Youre my choice 
Oh yeah yeah yeah
If beg you I must then Ill never give up cause
Your love is the only thing to fill this beggars cup
Im a choosey beggar  Choosey beggar choosey beggar 
And your my choice oh baby  Youre my choice 
When I need someone to hold me  Youre my choice 
When I need arms to unfold me  Youre my choice 
When I need someone beside me  Youre my choice
