When the snowman brings the snow
Well he just might like to know
Hes put a great big smile on somebodys face
If you jump into your bed
Quickly cover up your head
Dont you lock the doors
You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way
Well I wish it could be Christmas every day
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play
Oh I wish it could be Christmas every day
So let the bells ring out for Christmas
When were skating in the park
If the snow cloud makes it dark
Then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way
Now the frosty paws appear
And theyve frozen up my ear
So well lie by the fire
Til the sleet simply knocks em all away
When the snowman brings the snow  snowman brings the snow 
Well he just might like to know  just might like to know 
Hes put a great big smile on somebodys face
So if Santa brings that sleigh  Santa brings that sleigh 
All along the Milky Way  along the Milky Way 
Ill sign my name on the rooftop in the snow
Then he may decide to stay
Why dont you give your love for Christmas
