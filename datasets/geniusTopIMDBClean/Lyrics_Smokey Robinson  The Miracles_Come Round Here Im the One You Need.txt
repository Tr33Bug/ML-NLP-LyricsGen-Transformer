Come Round Here  Im the One You Need Lyrics
Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
And you just sit there in a daze reminiscing
When you know some other lips hes been kissing
Now when you need the love hes never shown you come round here
And when you need some loving arms to hold you come round here
Now I may not be the one you want oh
But I know Im the one you need said I
May not be the one you want ooh
But I know Im the one you need
Your life stands still the minute he goes
You count the hours just hoping he shows
Girl cant you see while youre longing for his touch
That Im the one who loves you so much
And while youre longing for his embrace
Youre alone there with tears on your face
Now when you feel the need to cry to someone cry to me
And when you feel the need to lean on someone lean on me
Now I may not be the one you want oh
But I sure nuff the one you need oh baby
I may not be the one you want ooh
But I know Im the one you need
Now the days the days you sit alone by yourself
Hes out fooling round with somebody else
And leaving you alone here with nothing to do
And just waiting til he has time for you
Now when the loneliness gets hard to bear girl come round here
And when you need a little tender loving care girl come round here
Now I may not be the one you want ooh
But I know Im the one you need ooh I said
I may not be the one you want
