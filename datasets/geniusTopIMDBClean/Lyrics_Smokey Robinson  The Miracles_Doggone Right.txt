You make me feel just like Im the luckiest man to ever live
Cause all the love one man could possibly get honey you gave
In your voice soft and low theres a little something
That lets me know
If you took your heart and made it mine
I would be true till the end of time
Oh yeah doggone right
When I am sad oh you take the time to be concerned
It makes a man feel so good to know that his love is being returned
Eenie meenie minie mo
Love is a guessing game I know
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose
But Ive got to win cause its you that I choose
Its you that I choose
Doggone right doggone right oh baby
If you think Im gonna stay let nobody take my love away
And your doggone right oh baby
You brighten up baby each and every day that I have to face
And if the sunshine dont shine
You smile is there to take its place
Smooth and warm tender touch
Letting me know that it means so much
To be loved by somebody who is just as much in love with you
Oh yeah doggone right
When I am sad oh you take the time to be concerned
It makes a man feel so good to know that his love is being returned
Eenie meenie minie mo
Love is a guessing game I know
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose
But Ive got to win cause its you that I choose
Its you that I choose
Doggone right doggone right
Said youre doggone right oh baby
If you think Im gonna stay
Let nobody take my love away
And your doggone right oh baby
