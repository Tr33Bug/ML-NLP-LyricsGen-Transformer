Oh well now youre the girl Im simply mad about
Oh yes Im really glad its been me Oh yeah
I hope that youve been getting ready
Cause Im gonna ask you to go steady with me
I got two eyes that happened by ya
And when they saw you they said they knew you were fine
I got two lips that long to kiss you
And when they speak they say they wish you were mine
Hey sweet baby oh dont you know that I am yours from head to toe
Oh I got a little heart inside me beating
And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time
You better watch out cause of what I say
Cause baby dont you know that I aint playing a game
Hey sweet baby oh dont you know that I am yours from head to toe
All the way down from the top to the ground sweet baby
I got two legs and I got two feet that always take me to your street
Everyday all the time
No matter which way I try to go my legs and my feet
They seem to know the way
Hey sweet baby oh dont you know that I am yours from head to toe
All the way down from the top to the ground Hey sweet baby
I am yours from head to toe Sweet baby
