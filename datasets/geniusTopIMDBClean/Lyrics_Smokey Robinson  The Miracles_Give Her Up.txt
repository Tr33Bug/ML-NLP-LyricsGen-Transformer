Give her up
Go and give the girl up cause shell only hurt you
Take your love like she did mine
And then shell desert you well
Walk away and leave your heart in pain
Walk away and leave you to go insane
Shes unfaithful yeah
You could do everything you can for her
Still shes gonna leave you cause shes ungrateful
How can I convince you shes gonna leave you on the shelf
And that shell never love anybody
She will never love anybody
She will never love anybody but herself
So give her up
Youd better give her up cause
She just wont do right
Let her go youd better let go cause
She wont treat you right
Dont you know youll go to her one day
Dont you know shell turn and walk away
Shes untrue untrue untrue
On second thought oh
Dont give her up
Cause I know Ill take her back
Whenever you give her up
Even though shes done me wrong
Cause I know the girls all alone
Ill take her back Ill take her back
