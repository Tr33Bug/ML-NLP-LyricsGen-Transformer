Saw you there and your laughter seemed to fill the air
A scent like perfume from your lovely hair
I said that I do adore
My heart said to me dont walk head on into misery
Hey with your eyes wide open cant you see
A hurts in store just like before
Oh ho ho but here I go again walking into love
Here I go again never thinking of
The danger that might exist
Disregarding all of this just for you
I ignore the detour sign
I wont stop until youre mine
Im past the point of no return
Girl you walk by and I said to me myself and I
Now weve got to give it one more try
I know somehow the time is now right now
Oh whoa here I go again walking into love
Here I go again walking into love
Here I go here I go
Here I go here I go again
