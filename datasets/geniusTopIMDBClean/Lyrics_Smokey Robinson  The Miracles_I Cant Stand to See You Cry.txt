Your love is so precious and rarely found  Mmm 
I realize there are few with your love around
Oh
Oh I see many guys taking advantage of you
They misuse your kindness as a weakness too
No longer can I stand back and watch your life fill with pain

Tryin to smile and keep the tears restrained
And baby I cant stand to see you cry
I love you too much thats why
Cause your love is so precious and rarely found
