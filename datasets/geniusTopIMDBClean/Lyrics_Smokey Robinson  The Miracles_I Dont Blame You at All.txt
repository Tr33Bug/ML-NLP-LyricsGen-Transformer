I dont blame you at all cause you played it cool
You dont owe me a thing cause I played the fool
No no no no no
Im only payin the price for a trip I took to paradise
Cause I looked into a pair of eyes
And what I thought was the look of love
Was only hurt in disguise
Too bad I didnt realize oh but dont apologize no cause
I dont blame you at all cause you played it cool
I shouldve did it myself
You dont owe me a thing cause I played the fool
No no no no no
I think its pretty plain holdin you would take a ball  chain
Every bet I made was all in vain
Cause what I thought was an ocean of love was just a wee drop of rain
Too bad that it couldnt rain oh but you dont have to explain no cause
I dont blame you at all cause you played it cool
I shouldve did it myself
You dont owe me a thing cause I played the fool
No no no no no
I dont blame you at all cause you played it cool
Thats the thing to do
You dont owe me a thing cause I played the fool
No no no no no
I said what I thought was sure to last to last was just a minute instead
Too bad that I got misled ah but you dont have to hang your head no cause


I dont blame you at all cause you played it cool
I shouldve did it myself
You dont owe me a thing cause I played the fool
No no no no no
I dont blame you at all cause you played it cool
Cause thats the thing to do
You dont owe me a thing cause I played the fool
No no no no no
