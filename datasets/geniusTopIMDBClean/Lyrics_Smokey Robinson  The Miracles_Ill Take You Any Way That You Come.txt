Since I saw you last theres been many a sunset
And every day were apart seems like a week
Oh but I knew you belonged to him when we first met
I know that maybe next time I see you we might not be able to speak
Its alright  Its alright  Its alright  Its alright 
If you dont come to me every night
Its ok baby  Its ok  Its Ok  Its OK 
If I dont hear from you everyday
Cause I want you and Im willing to
Take you any way that you come
All of your loving some of the time
Some of your loving all of the time
Just as long as I get some
Whoa yeah yeah mhmm
Its too bad its too bad
If loving you is gonna make me sad
Cause its too late woman its too late
Till you come all I can do is wait
Yes Ill be waiting anxiously
To take you any way that you come
I know hes there and I have to share
But Ill take any time you can spare
Just as long as I get some
Oooh baby baby baby baby
Oooh baby baby baby baby
Its too much its too much
What we go through trying to keep in touch
But its so true woman its so true
Id go through anything to be with you
It may take a while but you know Ill
Take you any way that you come
The clock strikes 1 and you gotta run
But part of your loving is better than none
Just as long as I get some
Oh its alright alright
If you dont come to me every night
Baby its ok now its ok
If i dont hear from you every day
Its too bad woman its too bad
If loving yous gonna make me sad
