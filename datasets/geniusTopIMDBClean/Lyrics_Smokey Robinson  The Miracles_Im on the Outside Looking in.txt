Im on the Outside  Looking in  Lyrics
Ooh ooh
Im on the outside looking in
And I wanna be and I wanna be back on the inside with you
You are with somebody new and I dont know what to do
Cause Im still in love with you  In love with you 
Im on the outside looking in
I dont wanna be I dont wanna be left on the outside all alone
Well I guess Ive had my day and you let me go my way
Now its me who has to pay
Ooh I never should have gone away
Never should have gone away and left you like I did  And left you 
With tears in your eyes
Oh I thought youd take me back
But to my surprise  To my surprise 
Im on the outside looking in
Gotta find a way gotta find a way back to your heart dear once again
Wont you take me back again Ill be waiting here til then
On the outside looking in ooh
Wont you take me back again Ill be waiting here til then
On the outside looking in  Im on the outside looking in 
Ooh  On the outside looking in 
Im on the outside looking in 
Dont leave me  On the outside looking in
