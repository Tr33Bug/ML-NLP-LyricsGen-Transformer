A girl named Mary dreamed of being in love
Gathering water by a lonely road
An angel came and whispered very low
You are the one that our God has chose
To have the Savior as it was told
To many prophets so long ago
And then he placed his hand upon her there
And she knew then the Savior she would bear
At Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
He rendered her a name that none would share
Except when faithfully kneeling in prayer
And she furrowed and said the name of Christ
And knew the dream would happen in life
At Christmastime
Oh we call it Christmastime
Oh you know its Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
To Joseph she exclaimed in truth that night
Of how the angel came with all his light
And soon they went and traveled to the place
Where one bright star would show where his head laid
When all men came from near and afar
To honor glory to the Son of God
And in the manger quietly he lay
Wise men and shepherds knelt by him to pray
Its Christmastime
Oh Christmastime
Oh I said its Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
Oh its Christmastime
Yeah I said its Christmastime
Oh I know its Christmastime
When Christ our Lord was born
Oh its Christmastime
Yeah
