Oohooh
Let it be soon dont hesitate
Make it now dont wait
Right now my love dont wait 
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to start
When I can fill your heart
With more love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
And my love will be so solid
It would take a hundred lifetimes
To live it down wear it down tear it down
This is no fiction this is no act
This is real its a fact
So real my love its a fact 
Ill always belong only to you
Each day Ill be living to
Make sure Im giving you
More love and more joy
Than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey now my love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down wear it down tear it down
Ooh oohoohooh
Oohooh


As we grow older no need to fear
When you need me Ill be here
Need me my love Ill be here 
Ill be beside you every step of the way
A heart thats truthful
And keeping you youthful
With more yeah more joy
Than age or time can ever destroy
Oh honey now my love will be so solid
It would take about a hundred lifetimes
To live it down wear it down tear it down
Gonna give you more ooh and more joy
Than any age or time could ever destroy
Oh baby now my love will be so solid
