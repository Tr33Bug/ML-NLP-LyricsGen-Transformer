When you were mine I loved you so much
A got a thrill from your every touch
You went away with somebody else
Now all I can say to comfort myself
Is that my girl has gone and said goodbye
Dont you cry hold your head up high
Dont give up give love one more try
Cause theres a right girl for every guy
Baby all your love wasnt right for me
Good for another it well may be
Some girls just werent made for some guys
Now Ive got to make myself realize
That my girl has gone  yes she has 
And said goodbye  I tell myself that 
Dont you cry hold your head up high
Keep on trying 
Dont give up give love one more try
Believe me now 
Theres a right girl for every guy oh yeah
Ive got the feelin
Yeah yeah yeah yeah baby
Now happiness and all the best
Thats all that I wish for you oh yeah
Dont be like me in misery
Im feelin so sad and blue
I said Im sad and Im blue oh yeah
Sad and Im blue I said Im sad and Im blue
Because my girl has gone
And said goodbye  and I tell myself 
Dont you cry hold your head up high
Keep on trying 
Dont give up give love one more try
Believe me now 
Theres a right girl for every guy oh yeah

 And I cant go on if I hear you say 
Girl has gone  yes you can  and said goodbye
And I start to cry I say 
Dont you cry hold your head up high
Ooowweeee  
Dont give up give love one more try
One time now 
Theres a right girl for every guy oh yeah
Sing it slow now children
