Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day
When its cold outside
Ive got the month of May
I guess youd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl  My girl my girl ooh 
Talkin bout my girl
My girl 
Ive got so much honey
The bees envy me
Ive got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well I guess you say
What can make me feel this way
My girl  My girl my girl ooh 
Talkin bout my girl
My girl
Ooh
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh yeah
I dont need no money
Fortune or fame
Ive got all the riches baby
One man can claim
Well I guess you say
What can make me feel this way
My girl  My girl my girl ooh 
Talkin bout my girl
My girl
Talkin bout my girl
Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I even got the month of May
My girl
Talkin bout
Talkin bout
My girl
Talkin bout my girl
