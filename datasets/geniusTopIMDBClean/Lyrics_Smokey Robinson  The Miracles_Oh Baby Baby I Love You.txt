Come take my hand lets walk the night
Somehow the moon and the stars seem right to tell you  To tell you 
I love you  I love you 
Ooh baby  Ooh baby 
I love you  I love you 
The beat of our hearts will set the pace
Now is the time and here is the place to tell you  To tell you 
I love you  I love you 
Ooh baby  Ooh baby 
I love you  I love you 
Its been a long time getting here
But Im sure youre worth the wait
A long time ago I set a trap for you
And you finally took the bait
Yeah  Yeah  baby yeah  Yeah 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
That look on your face that I see
Seems to say that you want me to tell you  To tell you 
I love you  I love you 
Ooh baby  Ooh baby 
I love you  I love you 
Ive got some love in store for you
That you just cant afford to miss
Some sweet sweet words to caress your ears
Will follow each and every kiss
Yeah  Yeah  my baby yeah  Yeah

Oohoohooh oohoohooh 
Ive got to tell you  To tell you 
I love you  I love you 
Ooh baby  Ooh baby

Oohoohooh oohoohooh 
Ooh Ive got to tell you  To tell you 
I love you  I love you

Come take my hand lets walk the night
