Ooh la la la la
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
Im cryin
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby
Mistakes I know Ive made a few
But Im only human
Youve made mistakes too
Im cryin
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby
Im just about at the end of my rope
But I cant stop tryin I cant give up hope
Cause Ill be here
One day Ill hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
Im cryin
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby
Ooh Ooh
Baby baby
Oohoo
