And everyday it seems I love you more and more
Now if theres some reason why I shouldnt love you
The way that I do with a love that is true

Loves a hallway with so many doors

Leave from within to go back where Ive been
So come on and
Point it out point it out to to me
Lock it up throw away the key

All that we need is love to succeed

Point it out oh baby now point it out to me
