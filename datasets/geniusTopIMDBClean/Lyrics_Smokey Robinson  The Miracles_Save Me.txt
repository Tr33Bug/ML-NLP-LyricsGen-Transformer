Now Ive cried a river since the day you said goodbye mhmm
And if you dont come back
Im going to drown in the tears I cry mhmm
Save me
Save me
Come on and save me
I need you so
Like falling off a mountain slope Im sinking down so fast
Clinging to a twig of hope that this separation wont last mhmm
Save me
Why dont you save me
Its up to you to save me baby
I need you so
Mhmm yeah yeah
Hmm without you here beside me Im only half alive
Hmm stay away from me any longer and I cant survive oh ho
Oh save me
Why dont you save me
Only you can save me baby
I need you so
Im asking you to save me
I need you so
Only you can save me yeah
I need you so
Oh save me save me save me
