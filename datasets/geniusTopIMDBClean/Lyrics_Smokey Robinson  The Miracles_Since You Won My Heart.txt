Since youve won my heart 
My but my days seem brighter
Oh my but my heart feels lighter
My but my wrongs seem righter
Since youve won my heart
Since youve won my heart 
Oh boy
But you havent brought anything but joy
Like a baby with a brandnew toy
Ooh since youve won my heart
Let me tell you that youre everything I ever wanted to me youre so exact
You know the right things to say you know just how to act
Im giving you all my love and thats a natural fact
Cause Im so glad I found you gonna build my world around you
Oh my  Oh my  but my nights seem shorter
Since I  Since I  met your mothers only daughter
Why  Oh why  dont you love me like you oughta
Since you won my heart
Since you won my heart 
Everything is alright
Since youve won my heart 
Every day and every night
Since youve won my heart 
Im walking around on a cloud
Since youve won my heart 
Im really feeling light in love
Since youve won my heart 
Since you won my heart
