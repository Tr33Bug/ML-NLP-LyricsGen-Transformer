You know that Im swept for you baby
And its time you were told
Yeah Im swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul
The first time that I saw you you stood out from the crowd
Looking so good and walking so proud
I wanted to say as you passed my way
You know that Im swept for you baby ah yeah
And its time you were told
Oh oh oh yeah Im swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul
Im just like a falling leaf on a windy day
And you like the breeze that comes and sweeps me away
Youre like a broom Im like dust in the room
Cause Im swept for you baby oh yeah
And its time you were told
Ooh Im swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul
You sweep me off my feet every time that you pass me by
Your presence in a room puts me on air
I dont have to see you to know when youre there
Its crazy but its true
Ooh Im swept baby baby
And its time you were told
Ooh Im swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul
Cant help but miss you
And its time you were told
Yeah Im swept for you baby
Way down deep in my soul
Im swept Im swept Im swept
