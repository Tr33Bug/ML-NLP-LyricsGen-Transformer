There you were beautiful
The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on with untrue kisses
Oh you held me captive in your false embrace
Quicker than I could bat an eye
Seems you were telling me goodbye
Ohoh just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartaches camouflage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
We used to meet in romantic places
Oh you gave the illusion that your love was real
Now all thats left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel
And now our meetings you avoid
And so my world you have destroyed
Ohoh just a minute ago your love was here
Oh baby all of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Yeah the way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
Oh yeah you only filled me with despair
By showing love that wasnt there
Oh just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where theres only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged
Oh the love I saw in you was just a mirage
Whooh yeah
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where theres only sand
Ooh ooh ooh you lured me into something I should have dodged
