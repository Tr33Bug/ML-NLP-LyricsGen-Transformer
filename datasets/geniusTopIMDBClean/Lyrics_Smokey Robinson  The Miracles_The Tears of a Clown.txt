Oh yeah yeah yeah
Now if theres a smile on my face
Its only there tryin to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin you
Now honey thats quite a different subject
But dont let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really Im sad
Sad sad sad sad 
Oh sadder than sad
Im hurt so bad 
Youre gone and Im hurtin so bad
I pretend to be glad 
Like a clown I pretend to be glad
Sad sad sad sad 
Now theres some sad things known to man
But aint too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When theres no one around
Mmmhmm oh yeah baby
Now if I appear to be carefree
Its only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride Ive tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But dont let my show convince you
That Ive been happy since you
Decided to go
Why did you go 
Oh I need you so
I need you so 
Im hurt and I want you to know
Want you to know 
But for others I put on a show
Its just a show  Oohoh


Theres some sad things known to man
But aint too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When theres no one around
Oh yeah
Just like Pagliacci did  The great pretender 
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye  The great pretender 
But in my lonely room I cry
The tears of a clown
When theres no one around
Oh yeah baby
Now if theres a smile on my face  Tears of clown 
Dont let my glad expression  Tears of a clown 
Give you the wrong impression
Dont let this smile I wear  Tears of a clown 
Make you think that I dont care
When really Im sad
Hurtin so bad  Tears of a clown 
Cryin all the time
