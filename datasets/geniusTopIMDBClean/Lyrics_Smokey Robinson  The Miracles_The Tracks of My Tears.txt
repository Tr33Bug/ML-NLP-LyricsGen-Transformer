People say Im the life of the party
Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside Im blue
So take a good look at my face
Youll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer its easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you  need you 
Need you  need you 
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like Im having fun
Although she may be cute shes just a substitute
Because youre the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
Youll see my smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer its easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you  need you 
Need you  need you 
Outside  Im masquerading
Inside  my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah since you put me down
My smile is my make up I wear since my break up with you
Baby take a good look at my face
Youll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah just look closer its easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Take a good look at my face
Ooh yeah youll see my smile looks out of place
Look a little bit closer its easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
