Ooh
Oh oh
Last night we had an argument
Oh oh yes we did
Although baby  Baby baby  the things I said
I never meant
Girl  Girl  Im so sorry  Im so sorry 
That I broke your tender heart
For weve come too far to end it now
Believe me
You say youre satisfied
And we can leave things just like this
Oh oh baby  Oh yeah oh yeah 
But what you dont realize is
Without your love I cant exist
So  So so so  please oh please have mercy  Please have mercy 
On me  On me  cant you see  Cant you see 
Oh that weve come much too far to end it now
Mmm
Oh weve come much too far to end it now baby
Now I know our love
Is much too very strong
Yes it is yes it is oh yes it is ooh  Oh yeah baby
To ever think about ending this
Would be so very wrong
Yes it will oh yes it will  Oh
Weve had arguments before
But theres one thing you must know
That I think weve come much too far to end it now
Oh baby  Much too far 
Oh weve come much too far to end it  Now 
Baby dont ya know I could never let you go
Really love you so gotta let ya know
Weve come much too far ah  To end it now 
Baby come to me gotta make you see
We can make it last just like in the past
Weve come much too far to end it
