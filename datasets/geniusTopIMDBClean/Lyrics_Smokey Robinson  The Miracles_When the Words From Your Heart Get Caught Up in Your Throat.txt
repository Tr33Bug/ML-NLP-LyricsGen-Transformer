Ooh
My heart has been trying to express itself
And its really getting me down
Theres a strange effect that comes over me
Whenever youre around
I have so much confidence when Im by myself
Its like my nerves wore an armored coat
But baby now youre such a charmer
You melt that coat of armor
And the words from my heart get caught up in my throat
Maybe Id better write a note
My heart is getting discouraged with giving me
Line after line after line
But my lips cant relay what my heart has to say
They stutter and stammer each time
If I dont tell you soon what my heart wants to say
My chance will get more remote
But each time youve given me
The opportunity
The words from my heart get caught up in my throat
Maybe Id better write a note
Ooh
I make the same promises to my heart every morning
That the very next time we met
I would tell you that I loved you and make you mine
By the time the sun starts to set
I rehearsed my lines a thousand times
Read some sweet poetry I could quote
But when you open your door to greet me
Smiling oh so sweetly
The words from my heart get caught up in my throat
I think Id better write a note
I want to say the words but theyre  Caught up in my throat 
Im gonna find myself a pencil cause I  Better write a note
