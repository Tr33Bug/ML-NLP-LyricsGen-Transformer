Whole Lot of Shakin in My Heart  Since I Met You  LyricsI cant explain the things you do to me
But Im sure theres an explanation
Maybe its the way you carry yourself
Or maybe its your conversation
You got me tiptoeing on a cloud
I pray that I might fall through
And hit rock bottom soon to be forgotten
Like so many other people do
I need you to help me convince myself  ohohoh I love you 
That besides me theres noone else  ohohoh I love you 
Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin in my heart since I met you
Dont you know I a whole lot of shakin in my heart since I met you
The guys I used to hang around with
Tell me that Ive changed that Im acting kinda strange
But they dont realise that since I met you
My whole life has been rearranged
You make me feel kinda insecure
Cause my heart I can no longer control
And youve got me knocking jumping and stopping
Dont know which way Im supposed to go
My heart is all tied up in knots  ohohoh I love you 
I walk around daily in a state of shock  ohohoh I love you 
Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin in my heart since I met you
Dont you know I feel a whole lot of shakin in my heart since I met you
My heart is all tied up in knots  ohohoh I love you 
I walk around daily in a state of shock  ohohoh I love you 
Cause I feel a whole lot of shakin in my heart since I met you
Dont you know I feel a whole lot of shakin in my heart since I met you
