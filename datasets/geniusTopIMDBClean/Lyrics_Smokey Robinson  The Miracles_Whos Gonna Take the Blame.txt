Mhm
Mmmm
We were just kids playin in the rain
When you threw a stone and you broke a windowpane
You were so afraid for what youd done
That I held your hand little one and I wouldnt let you run woah
Then you turned to me with a look of shame on your face
And your eyes asked a question ever so tenderly oh
Who will take the blame Whos gonna bear the shame
Right then I knew how it would always be
Put the blame put it on me
Mhm
At the age of twelve you were a fine young thing
But I felt much older cause I had to shoulder the trouble youd bring
Like the time you pushed Sonny down and she cut her knee
With those same big eyes you turned and you looked at me oh
Who will take the blame Whos gonna bear the shame
Right then I knew how it would always be
Put the blame put it on me
Put it on me put it on me
Now youre all grown up and youre running wild
And theyre so surprised cause all along you seemed like such a sweet child
And theres nothing but bad news from all the friends I meet
How youve become a a woman of the streets oh
And they give me a million and one reasons why
But when I analyze it I know where the real fault lies oh


Who will take the blame Whos gonna bear the shame
No doubt about it ooh this time rightfully
Put the blame put it on me ohoh
Who will take the blame  Whos I said whos  Whos gonna bear the shame
Put the blame put it on me ohoh
Who will take the blame Whos gonna bear the shame
Put the blame put it on me ohoh
Who will take the blame  Put it on me  Whos gonna bear the shame  Put it on me 
Put the blame put it on me
