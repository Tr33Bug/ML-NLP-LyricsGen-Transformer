Oohoooo
Yesterday we made future plans
She loved me I could tell
Can today be that tomorrow that we planned so well
Yester baby Ill never forget her
Though tomorrow might bring me one better
Today Ill be on my away to love my yester love
Today Ill go on my way to love my yester love oh oh
Yesterday I felt a tender kiss upon my face
Now the day is gone and theres a tear drop in its place
Oh yester kisses that I used to treasure
Now youre given some other lips pleasure
Today Im on my way dreamin of my yester love
Today Ill go on my way dreamin of my yester love oh oh
Yester is the prefix that we fix to things that have gone by
Forever they say yeah even though my yester love
Has slipped through my fingers I find it still lingers
In my heart todayayay
Yesterday I thought I had a love to call my own
No one could have told me that today Id be alone
Oh oh yes the sweetness today has gone sour
Seemin further away with each hour
Today Ill go on my way dreamin of all my yester love
Today Ill go on my way dreamin of my yester love
Today Ill go on my way dreamin of my yester love
