You look as if youre softer than a rosebud
And youre warmer than the sun that makes it grow
Right now youre walking away
Im gonna stop you and say
I dont mean to be so bold
But from the things that Ive been told
You must be love
Oh you must be love yeah
You look as if youre only out walking
You dont even notice how Im watchin you
Hey but the closer you come
You make me feel more numb
Oh I cant say positively  Not positive 
But from the feeling that you give me
You must be love
I do believe that you must be love yeah
Oh love couldnt possibly be
Anything that youre not
I know that love couldnt possibly have
Anything you havent got
Youre walking my way Im gonna stop you and say 
Oh you may not be the love that Ive heard about
But if I had to choose between the two
No question in my mind
Id take you every time
Although loves been described to me  Described to me 
You fit the description to a T so
You must be love  You must be love 
I do believe that you must be love  You must be love 
I can tell by the way you make me feel  You must be love 
I can tell cause the feeling is so real  You must be love 
I do believe that you must be love  You must be love
