Ive been throwing coins in every fountain
Wishing on every star that shines at night
It could be Ive been counting too much on stars and fountains
That only twinkle and sprinkle me with water
But it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
Said it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
I spent my last ten dollars on some perfume
And I thought it said the things I couldnt say
The storeman guaranteed that this was what I need
But it turns out that it wasnt worth a quarter
Cause it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
Said it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
The only girl your mamas got
And anyone can see that she loves you a lot
But so do I and Im a man
And youre the only girl that fits into my plan
Of a love life made for two
If a man was good for mama a man is good for you
A man is good for you a man is good for you
Ooh
So many things Ive tried to get you by my side
But nothing seems to work like honor
Cause it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
Said it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
Ooh it didnt help me get your mothers only ooh
Said it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
Hey it didnt help me get your mothers only daughter oohooh
It didnt help me get your mothers only daughter
