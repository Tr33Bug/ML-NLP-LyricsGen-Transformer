You made my soul a burning fire
Youre getting to be my one desire
Youre getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love Ill have to give
A little more love thats devoted and true
Cause all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you  thinking about you baby 
All I do is think about you
Baby just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance a boy like me youre really been trying to find
Well let me tell you girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
Well Im gonna tell you girl
Id light a candle every day
And pray that youll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
Cause all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you  I think about you 
All I do is think about you
Gonna tell you girl
Id light a candle every day
And pray that youll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
Im gonna tell you girl
If I cannot have you for my own
Id rather be lonely and all alone
Id rather keep thinking the way that I do
Cause all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
Think about you baby 
All I do is think about you
Think about you baby 
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you baby 
All I do is think about you
Think about you baby 
All I do is think about you
Baby baby 
Im thinking baby bout you baby
Im thinking baby bout you baby
Im thinking baby give it to me baby
Im thinking baby bout you baby
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
Think about you baby 
All I do is think about you
Cant you feel the fire burning
Cant you feel the birds humming  All I do is think about you 
Cant you feel my love flowing  All I do is think about you 
Cant you see my love growing
All I do is think about you
