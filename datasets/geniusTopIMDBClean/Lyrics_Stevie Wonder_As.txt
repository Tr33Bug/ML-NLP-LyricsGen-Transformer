As around the sun the earth knows shes revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows loves the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That Ill be loving you always
As now cant reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That Ill be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  Always 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  Always 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  Always 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That Ill be loving you always
As today I know Im living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustnt fear
For Ill know deep in my mind
The love of me Ive left behind
Cause Ill be loving you always
Until the day is night and night becomes the day  Always 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  Always 
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  Always 
Until the day that is the day that are no more  Did you know youre loved by somebody 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left  Always 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself  Ill be loving you forever 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through  Always 
Until the day that you are me and I am you  Always 
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  Always 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  Always 


We all know sometimes lifes hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say youre in it but not of it
Youre not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our childrens grandchildren
And their greatgrandchildren will tell
Ill be loving you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  Loving you 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  Loving you 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  Loving you 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream  Be loving you 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day  Loving you 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  Loving you 
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  Loving you 
Until the day that is the day that are no more  Loving you 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left  Be loving you 
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself  Loving you 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through  Loving you 
Until the day that you are me and I am you  Now aint that loving you 
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  Aint that loving you 
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  And Ive got to say always 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  Always 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream  Always 
Until the day is night and night becomes the day  Always 
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  Always 
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more  Always 
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself  Always 
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
