First man to die
For the flag we now hold high

With a flag held in our hand
Was first the red mans

Came on tracking that was laid
By the yellow man
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
Red blue and white
But we all must be given
The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
History will repeat again
Its time we learned

Is a time when a country celebrates
But as your hand touches your heart
Remember we all played a part
In America to help that banner wave

Helped lead Lewis and Clark
Was a red woman

In our country got its start
By a yellow man
And the leader with a pen
Signed his name to free all men
Was a white man
We pledge allegiance
All our lives
To the magic colors
Red blue and white

The liberty that we defend
For with justice not for all men
