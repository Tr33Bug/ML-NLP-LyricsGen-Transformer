My whole body gets weak
When youre standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

I know the records about to end
But were just going to play and play until it goes away
So if you dont like the groove you can turn the record off
It wont cost you nothing but a penny and youll have a cough

But I ha ha ha ha hha ha ha

Well I know Ive got something for your body
