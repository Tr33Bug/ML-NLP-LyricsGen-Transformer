Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having but
Dont you worry bout a thing

They say your style of lifes a drag
And that you must go other places
But just dont you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces
Dont you worry bout a thing

Cause Ill be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip
Dont you worry bout a thing
Dont you worry bout a thing

Dont you worry bout a thing mama
Cause Ill be standing in the side
When you check it out
When you get off your trip
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But youre the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through
But dont you worry bout a thing
Dont you worry bout a thing pretty mama
Cause Ill be standing in the wings
When you check it out
Dont you worry bout a thing
