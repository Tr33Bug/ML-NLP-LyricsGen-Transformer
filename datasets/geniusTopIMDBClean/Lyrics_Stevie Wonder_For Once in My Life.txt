For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone Ive needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know Ill be strong
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life I wont let sorrow hurt me
Not like its hurt me before
For once I have something I know wont desert me
Im not alone anymore
For once I can say this is mine you cant take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone who needs me
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Oh Im in love baby
For once in my life I wont let sorrow hurt me
Not like its hurt me before
For once I have something I know wont desert me
Im not alone anymore
For once I can say this is mine you cant take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone who needs me
For once in my life
Somebody that needs me
For once in my life
