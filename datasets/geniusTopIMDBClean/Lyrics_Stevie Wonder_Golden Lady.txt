Looking in your eyes
Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far
Cause Im not afraid to try and go it
To know the love and the beauty never known before
Ill leave it up to you to show it
And golden lady golden lady
Id like to go there
Golden lady golden lady
Id like to go there
Take me right away
Looking at your hands
Hands can understand
Waiting for the chance
Just to hold your hand
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow
Into a lovely smile thats blooming
And its so clear to me that heres a dream come true
Theres no way that Ill be losing
And golden lady golden lady
Id like to go there
Golden lady golden lady
Id like to go there
Take me right away


A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow

Id like to go there
Golden lady golden lady
Id like to go there
Golden lady golden lady
Id like to go there
