People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
Cause it wont be too long
Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
Cause it wont be too long
Im so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
Im so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Til I reach my highest ground
Teachers keep on teaching
Preachers keep on preaching
World keep on turning
Cause it wont be too long
Oh no
Lovers keep on loving
Believers keep on believing
Sleepers just stop sleeping
Cause it wont be too long
Oh no
Im so glad that he let me try it again
Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
Im so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Til I reach my highest ground
Woo
Til I reach my highest ground
No ones going to bring me down
Oh no
Til I reach my highest ground
Dont you let nobody bring you down  Theyll sho nuff try 
God is gonna show you highest ground
Hes the only friend youll have around
Cause the rest of the world will bring you down
