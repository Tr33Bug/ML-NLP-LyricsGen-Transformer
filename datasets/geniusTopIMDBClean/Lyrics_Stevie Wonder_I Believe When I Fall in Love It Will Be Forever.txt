I Believe  When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever  Lyrics
Shattered dreams
Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began
Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Without despair
We will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been
Must never end
And with the strength we have wont be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They wont be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind
Mm
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Ever ever ever ever
Ow
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again 
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
Im so glad that I found someone to believe in again
