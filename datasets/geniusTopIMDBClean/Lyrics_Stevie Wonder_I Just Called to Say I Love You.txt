No New Years Day to celebrate
No chocolatecovered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring no song to sing
In fact heres just another ordinary day
No April rain no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is its something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summers high no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you  Yeah 
I just called to say how much I care I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
Of my heart of my heart
Baby of my heart
