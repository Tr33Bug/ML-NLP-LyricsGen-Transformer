I was born in Lil Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
Dont you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Yeah Hey hey hey
Shes been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
Thats why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey hey hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just wont end
Cause I love my baby love my baby hey
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I aint going nowhere
I was kneehigh to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side Ill still be standing there
Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her yeah
Ah I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey hey hey
Ooh baby I was made to please her
You know Stevie aint gon leave her no
Hey hey hey ooh wee baby
