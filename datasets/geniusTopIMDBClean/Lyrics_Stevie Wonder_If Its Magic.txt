If its magic
Then why cant it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time
If its pleasing
Then why cant it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So if its special
Then with it why arent we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So if its magic
Why cant we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For theres enough for everyone
Oh
Oh
