Isnt she lovely
Isnt she wonderful
Isnt she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love wed be
Making one as lovely as she
But isnt she lovely Made from love
Isnt she pretty
Truly the angels best
Boy Im so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I cant believe what God has done
Through us Hes given life to one
But isnt she lovely Made from love
Isnt she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
Thats so very lovely made from love
