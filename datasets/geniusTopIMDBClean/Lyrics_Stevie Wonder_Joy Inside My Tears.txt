Ive always come to the conclusion that but is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one wholl fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know
And baby thats you you you
Made lifes history
Cause youve brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
Youve brought some joy inside my tears
Ive always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
Baby baby its you you you
Made lifes history  Oh baby 
Youve brought some joy inside my tears
