I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I dont want to bore you with my trouble
But theres somethin bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Theres somethin bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
I dont want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you I love you I love you
I dont want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you I love you I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree thats seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I dont want to bore you with my trouble
But theres somethin bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
But theres somethin bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
That knocks me off my feet
I dont want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you I love you I love you
I dont want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you I love you I love you
I dont want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you I love you I love you
Darling I dont want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you I love you I love you
I dont want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you I love you I love you
Darling I dont want to
