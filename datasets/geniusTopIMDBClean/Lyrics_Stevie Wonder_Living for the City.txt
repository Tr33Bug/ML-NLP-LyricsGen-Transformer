A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that aint so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough just enough for the city
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And youd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough just enough for the city  Yeah 
Da da da da da da da

Da da da la la  Hey

Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school shes got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough just enough for the city  Mmm 
Her brothers smart hes got more sense than many
His patiences long but soon he wont have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Cause where he lives they dont use colored people
Living just enough just enough for the city  Yeah

Bus for New York City
Hey bus driver Im getting on there hold it 
Thanks a lot 
Wow New York just like I pictured it 
Skyscrapers and everything 
Hey hey brother hey come here slick  Huh 
Hey you look you look hip man 
Hey you wanna make yourself five bucks man  Yeah 
You look hip run this across the street for me right quick 
Okay run this across the street for me 
What Huh I didnt know What
Gimme your hands up you punk
Im just going across the street 
Put that leg up shut your mouth 
Hell no what did I do
Okay turn around turn around 
Put your hands behind your back lets go lets go 
A jury of your peers having found you guilty ten years 
What
Come on come on get in that cell nigger 
God Lord 
His hair is long his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
Hes almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him theres no solution
Living just enough just enough for the city
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel nowhere could be much colder
If we dont change the world will soon be over
Living just enough stop giving just enough for the city
