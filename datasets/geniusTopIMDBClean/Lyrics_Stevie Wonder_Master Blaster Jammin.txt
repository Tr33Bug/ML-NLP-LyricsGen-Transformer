Master Blaster  Jammin  Lyrics
Everyones feeling pretty
Its hotter than July
Though the worlds full of problems
They couldnt touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marleys hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block
Didnt know you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Would be jammin and jammin and jammin jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third Worlds right on the one
Nows the time for celebration
Cause weve only just begun
Didnt know that you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Would be jammin until the the break of dawn
Were jammin jammin jammin jam on
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that Im ecstatic
Cause we all just made a pact
Weve agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When youre moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star


You didnt know that you
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Oh oh oh oh oh you
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
Dont you stop the music oh no no no baby baby
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Na no na na na na na
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
No no no baby nobody told you oh oh oh you
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Would be jammin until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin
You would not believe it
Because you never thought that youd be jammin
Oh oh oh oh
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Jammin til the break of dawn
Oh oh
You may as well believe what you are feeling
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Because you feel your body jammin
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Oh oh you would be jammin until the break of dawn
Oh oh whoo whoo
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin 
Baby baby baby baby
Were in the middle of the makins of the master blaster jammin
