La la la la la la
La la la la la la
My cherie amour lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour pretty little one that I adore
Youre the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
Ive been near you but you never noticed me
My cherie amour wont you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Maybe someday youll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday Ill share your little distant cloud
Oh cherie amour pretty little one that I adore
Youre the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
