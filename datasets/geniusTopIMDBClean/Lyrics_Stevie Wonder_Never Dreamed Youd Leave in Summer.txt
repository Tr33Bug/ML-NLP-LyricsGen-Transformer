I never dreamed youd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone
You said there would be warm love in springtime
That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed youd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone
You said then youd be the life in autumn
Said youd be the one to see the way
No I never dreamed youd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away
Why didnt you stay
