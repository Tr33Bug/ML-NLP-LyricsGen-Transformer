Ngiculela ikusasa
Ngiyacula ngo thando
Ngicula ngelinyi langa
Uthando luyobusa
Jikelele kulomhlaba wethu
Es una historia de maana
Es una historia de amor
Es una historia que amor reinar
Por nuestro mundo
Es una historia de mi corazn
Theres songs to make you smile
Theres songs to make you sad
But with a happy song to sing
It never seems as bad
To me came this melody
So Ive tried to put in words how I feel
Tomorrow will be for you and me
I am singing of tomorrow
I am singing of love
I am singing someday love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
I am singing of love from my heart
Lets all sing someday sweet love will reign
Throughout this world of ours
Lets start singing
Of love from our hearts
Lets start singing
Of love from our hearts
