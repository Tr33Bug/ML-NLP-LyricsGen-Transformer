Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Theyve been wasting most of their time
Glorifying days long gone behind
Theyve been wasting most their days
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise
Tell me who of them will come to be
How many of them are you and me
Dissipation race relations
Consolation segregation
Dispensation isolation
Exploitation mutilation
Mutation miscreation
Confirmation to the evils of the world
Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
Theyve been looking in their minds
For the day that sorrows lost from time
They keep telling of the day
When the savior of love will come to stay
Tell me who of them will come to be
How many of them are you and me
Proclamation of race relations
Consolation is integration
Verification of revelation
Acclamation world salvation
Vibration stimulation
Confirmation to the peace of the world
Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
Theyve been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
Weve been spending too much of our lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Lets start living our lives
Living for the future paradise
Praise to our lives
Living for the future paradise
Shame to anyones life
Living in a pastime paradise
