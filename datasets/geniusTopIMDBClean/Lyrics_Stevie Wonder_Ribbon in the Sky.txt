Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbons in the sky for our love
If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
Theres a ribbon in the sky for our love
DoDo
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM
This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love love
We cant lose with God on our side
Well find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love
DoDo
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM
Theres a ribbon in the sky for our love
