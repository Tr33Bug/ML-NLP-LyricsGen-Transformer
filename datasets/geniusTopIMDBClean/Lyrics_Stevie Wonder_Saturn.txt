Packing my bags going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
Theres no sense to sit and watch people die
We dont fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
Theres no sense to keep on doing such crimes
Theres no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just cant be bought or sold
Tell me why are you people so cold
Im going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Dont need cars cause weve learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high
We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men women and children
That dont even know what theyre dying for
We cant trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or well destroy
Im going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Dont need cars cause weve learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high
Ima stop on J
Dont do that  Let her go first 
Let her go first please let her go first  Let me go first go head 
Alright let Alwatta go by herself
Okay then we gon take turns
Alright
Strawberry shortcake cream on top
Tell me the name of your sweetheart
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P
Paul oh Paul
