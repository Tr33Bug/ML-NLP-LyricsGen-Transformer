Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Dont make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people go
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just wont quit
But here are some of musics pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget no
For theres Basie Miller Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ellas ringing out
Theres no way the band can lose
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all all allallall over the people
Cant you feel it all over
Come on lets feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody all over people go
