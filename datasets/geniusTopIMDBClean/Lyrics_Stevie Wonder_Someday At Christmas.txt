Someday at Christmas men wont be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas therell be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what lifes really worth
Therell be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas well see a land
With no hungry children no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas therell be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment one prayer away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be 
Someday in a world where men are free 
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime
