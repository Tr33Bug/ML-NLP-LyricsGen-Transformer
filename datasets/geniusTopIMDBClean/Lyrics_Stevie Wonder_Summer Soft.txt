Summer Soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning Rain
Gently plays her rhythms on your windowpane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine
And so you wait to see what shell do
Is it sun or rain for you
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find its October
And shes gone
And shes gone
Summers gone
Taking with her summers play
Winter Wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer he begins
Forcing dangers way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when he never lets you know
If its snow or clear days youll find
And so you wait to see what hell do
Is it sun or snow for you
But it breaks your heart in two
Cause youve been fooled by April
And hes gone
And hes gone
Winters gone
You find its October
And shes gone
And shes gone
Summers gone
Youve been fooled by April
And hes gone
And hes gone
Winters gone
You find its October
And shes gone
And shes gone
Summers gone
Youve been fooled by April
And hes gone
And hes gone
Winters gone
