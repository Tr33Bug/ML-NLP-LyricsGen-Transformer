Superwoman  Where Were You When I Needed You  Lyrics
Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head
But I just want to live each day to love her
For what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind
But very well I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me too very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well and I think I can be very well
Wish that you knew me too very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head
Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream
My woman wants to be a superwoman
And I just had to say goodbye
Because I cant spend all my hours starting to cry
But very well I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me too very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well think that I know you very well
Wish you knew me like I know you very well
But I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Your filthy head 
Very well dum dum da dum dum da
Very well wish you knew me too very well
And I wish I could think of everything going through your head
Very well dum dum da dum da dum da
Dum dum da dum da very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
When the summer came you were not around
Now the summers gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter my love
When the winter came you went further south
Parting from loves nest leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you like right now
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect loves past
When the winter came you were not around
Through the bitter winds love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter my love
Oh I need you baby I need you baby
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect loves past oh
Spring will fill the air you will come around
Is it summer love that will let me down
Where were you when I needed you last winter my love
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Where are you when I need you like right now
Right now right now right now
Where were you when I needed you last winter my dear
I need you baby I need you baby I need you baby
I need you baby I need you baby I need you baby
Oh where were you when I needed you last winter last winter
Yeah need you baby need you need you baby
Oh you want me to need you baby
Oh where were you when I needed you last dear yeah
