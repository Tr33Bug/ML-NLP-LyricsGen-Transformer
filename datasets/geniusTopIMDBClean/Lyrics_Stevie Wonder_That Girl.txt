That girl thinks that shes so fine
That soon shell have my mind
That girl thinks that shes so smart
That soon shell have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That shell be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that youll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that shes so bad
Shell change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
Cause she can please her man
She doesnt use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me theres no room for doubt
That it wont be too long
Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that Id love to that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love
Ive been hurting for a long time
And youve been playing for a long time
You know its true
Ive been holding for a long time
And youve been running for a long time
Its time to do what we have to do
That girl That girl
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasnt heard
But what she doesnt realize is that Ive listened to every word
That girl that girl that girl
Oh That girl that girl that girl that girl
