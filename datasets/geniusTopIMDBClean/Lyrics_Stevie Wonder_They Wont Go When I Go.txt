No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They wont go when I go
All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they wont go when I go
And Ill go where Ive longed
To go so long
Away from tears
Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him Ill bide
And they wont go when I go
Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
Cause they wont go when I go
And Ill go where Ive longed
To go so long
Away from tears
Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There aint no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He will give he will give
He aint hardly gonna give oh yeah
The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
And they wont go when I go
Since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see
Cause they wont go when I go
And Ill go where Ill go
No one can keep me from
My destiny yeah
They wont go where I go whoa oh whoa oh
