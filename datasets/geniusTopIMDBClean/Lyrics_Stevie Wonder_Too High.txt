Im too high Im too high
But I aint touched the sky
Im too high Im too high
But I aint touched the sky
Shes a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the TV screen
She takes another puff and says Its a crazy scene
That red is green and shes a tangerine
Im too high Im too high
But I aint left the ground
Im too high Im too high
I hope I never ever come down
Shes the girl in her life
But her worlds a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice she wasnt very nice
Im too high Im too high
I cant ever touch the sky
Im too high Im so high
I feel like Im about to die
Shes a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
And did you hear the news about the girl today
She passed away what did her friend say
They said shes too high too high
Cant hang around anyway
