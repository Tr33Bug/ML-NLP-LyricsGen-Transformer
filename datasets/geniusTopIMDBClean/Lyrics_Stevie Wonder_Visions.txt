People hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land
Where hates a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a vision in my mind
The law was never passed
But somehow all men feel they are truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind
Im not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only turn to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Todays not yesterday
And all things have an ending
But what Id like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind
Im not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Todays not yesterday
And all things have an ending
But what Id like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
To the visions in our minds
