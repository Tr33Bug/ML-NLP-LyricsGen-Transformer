You are the sunshine of my life
Thats why Ill always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever youll stay in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning
Though Ive loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
Id find myself drowning in my own tears woah
You are the sunshine of my life yeah
Thats why Ill always stay around mmmmmm yeahyeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever youll stay in my heart
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue ooh
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you woah
You are the sunshine of my life yeah
Thats why Ill always stay around mmm  Baby 
You are the apple of my eye
Forever youll stay in my heart yeah
You are my sunshine of my life oh yeah
