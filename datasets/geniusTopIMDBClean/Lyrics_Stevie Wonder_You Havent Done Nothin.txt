We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that youll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You havent done nothin
Its not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else yeah
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You havent done nothin

We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
Thats becoming real life mmm
But when misled who knows a persons mind
Can turn as cold as ice mmm hmm
Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
Cause if you really want to hear our views
You havent done nothin
