You and I  We Can Conquer the World  Lyrics
Here we are on earth together its you and I
God has made us fall in love its true
Ive really found someone like you
Will it stay the love you feel for me
Will it say that you will be by my side to see me through
Until my life is through
Well in my mind we can conquer the world
In love you and I you and I you and I
I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because thats all that I am living for you see
Dont worry what happens to me
Cause in my mind you will stay here always
In love you and I you and I you and I you and I
In my mind we can conquer the world
In love you and I you and I you and I
Oh you and I
