Hey
And she was lying in the grass
And she could hear the highway breathing
And she could see a nearby factory
Shes making sure she is not dreaming
See the lights of a neighbors house
Now shes starting to rise
Take a minute to concentrate
And she opens up her eyes
The world was moving and she was
Right there with it and she was
The world was moving she was
Floating above it and she was
And she was
And she was drifting through the backyard
And she was taking off her dress
And she was moving very slowly
Rising up above the earth
Moving into the universe
And shes drifting this way and that
Not touching the ground at all
And shes up above the yard
The world was moving and she was right there with it
And she was
Hey hey
The world was moving she was floating above it
And she was
Hey hey hey
And she was glad about it no doubt about it
She isnt sure about what shes done
No time to think about what to tell them
No time to think about what shes done
And she was
Hey hehey hey
And she was looking at herself
And things were looking like a movie
She had a pleasant elevation
Shes moving out in all directions oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey  hey 
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
The world was moving she was right there with it
And she was
The world was moving she was floating above it
And she was
Joining the world of missing persons
And she was  hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
Missing enough to feel alright
And she was ha ha
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was
And she was hey hey
And she was
And she was
And she was
