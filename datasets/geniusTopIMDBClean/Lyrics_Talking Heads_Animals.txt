Ah ah ah ah
Im mad and thats a fact
I found out animals dont help
Animals think theyre pretty smart
Shit on the ground see in the dark
They wander around like a crazy dog
Make a mistake in the parking lot
Always bumping into things
Always let you down down down down
Ah ah ah ah
Animals think they understand
Trusting them a big mistake
Animals want to change my life
I will ignore animals advice
Theyre never there when you need them
Theyre never there when you call them
Theyre never there when you need them
Theyre never there when you call them down down down down
I know the animals are laughing at us
Dont even know what a joke is
I wont follow animals advice
I dont care if theyre laughing at us
Theyre never there when you need them
Theyre never there when you call them
Theyre never there when you need them
Theyre never there when you call them down down down
Ah ah ah
