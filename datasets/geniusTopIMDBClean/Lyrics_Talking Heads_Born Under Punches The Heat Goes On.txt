Born Under Punches  The Heat Goes On  Lyrics
Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands
The hand speaks
The hand of a government man
Well Im a tumbler
Born under punches
Im so thin
All I want is to breathe  Im too thin 
Wont you breathe with me
Find a little space so we move inbetween  Inbetween it 
And keep one step ahead of yourself
Dont you miss it Dont you miss it
Some a you people just about missed it
Last time to make plans well Im a tumbler
Im a government man
Never seen anything like that before
Falling bodies tumble cross the floor  But Im a tumbler 
When you get to where you wanna be  Thank you thank you 
When you get to where you wanna be  Yeah dont even mention it 
Take a look at these hands theyre passing inbetween us
Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands you dont have to mention it
No thanks Im a government man
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on where the hand has been
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on  Got time  and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on where the hand has been
And the heat goes on and the heat goes on
And the heat goes on  Im not a drowning man 
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on  And Im not a burning building 
And the heat goes on  Im a tumbler 
And the heat goes on  Drowning cannot hurt a man 
Where the hand has been
And the heat goes on  Fire cannot hurt a man 
And the heat goes on  Not the government man 
And the heat goes on  All 
And the heat goes on  I want 
And the heat goes on  Is to breathe 
And the heat goes on  Thank you thank you 
And the heat goes on  Wont 
And the heat goes on  You breathe 
And the heat goes on  With me 
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on  Find 
And the heat goes on  A little space 
And the heat goes on  So we 
And the heat goes on  Move inbetween   Im so thin 
And the heat goes on  And keep 
And the heat goes on  One step ahead 
And the heat goes on  Of yourself 
And the heat goes on  Im catching up with myself 
And the heat goes on  All 
And the heat goes on  I want 
And the heat goes on  Is to breathe 
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on  Wont 
And the heat goes on  You breathe 
And the heat goes on  With me 
And the heat goes on  Hands of a government man 
And the heat goes on  Find 
And the heat goes on  A little space 
And the heat goes on  So we 
And the heat goes on  Move inbetween 
And the heat goes on  And keep 
And the heat goes on  One step ahead 
And the heat goes on  Of yourself 
And the heat goes on  Dont you miss it dont you miss it 
And the heat goes on  All 
And the heat goes on  I want 
And the heat goes on  Is to breathe 
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on  Wont 
And the heat goes on  You breathe 
And the heat goes on  With me 
And the heat goes on
And the heat goes on  Find 
And the heat goes on  A little space 
And the heat goes on  So we 
And the heat goes on  Move inbetween 
And the heat goes on  And keep 
And the heat goes on  One step ahead 
And the heat goes on  Of yourself
