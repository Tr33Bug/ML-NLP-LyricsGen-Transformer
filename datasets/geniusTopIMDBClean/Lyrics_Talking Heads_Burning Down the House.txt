Ah
Watch out you might get what youre after
Cool babies  strange but not a stranger
Im an ordinary guy
Burning down the house
Hold tight wait till the partys over
Hold tight were in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house
Heres your ticket pack your bag its time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire ah
All wet here you might need a raincoat
Shakedown dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixtyfive degrees
Burning down the house
It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say Baby what did you expect
Gonna burst into flame ah
Burning down the house
My house is out of the ordinary
Thats right dont wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house


No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing yet
Everythings stuck together
I dont know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire ah
