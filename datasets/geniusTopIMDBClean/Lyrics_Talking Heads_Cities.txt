Think of London small city
Its dark dark in the daytime
People sleep sleep in the daytime
If they want to if they want to
Im checking em out Im checking em out
I got it figured out I got it figured out
Theres good points some bad points
But it all works out though Im a little freaked out
Ill find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
Lot of rich people in Birmingham
Lot of ghosts in a lot of houses
Look over there dry ice factory
Good place to get some thinking done
Im checking it out Im checking it out
I got it figured out I got it figured out
Theres good points some bad points
But it all works out you know Im a little freaked out
Ill find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
Im checking em out Im checking em out
I got it figured out I got it figured out
Theres good points some bad points
But it all works out sometimes Im a little freaked out


Ill find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
Help me
Did I forget to mention forget to mention Memphis
Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks
Do I smell I smell home cooking
Its only the river its only the river
Im checking it out Im checking it out
I got it figured out I got it figured out
Theres good points some bad points
But it all works out sometimes Im a little freaked out
Ill find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
Find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
Find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
I will find a city find myself a city to live in
