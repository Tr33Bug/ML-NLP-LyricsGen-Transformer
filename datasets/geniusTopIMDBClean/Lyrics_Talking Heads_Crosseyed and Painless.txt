Lost my shape trying to act casual
Cant stop I might end up in the hospital
Changing my shape I feel like an accident
Theyre back to explain their experience
Isnt it weird Looks too obscure to me
Wasting away that was their policy
Im ready to leave I push the facts in front of me
Facts lost facts are never what they seem to be
Nothing there no information left of any kind
Lilifting my head lololooking for the danger signs
There was a line there was a formula
Sharp as a knife facts cut a hole in us
There was a line there was a formula
Sharp as a knife facts cut a hole in us

The feeling returns whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head looking around inside
The Island of Doubt its like the taste of medicine
Working by hindsight got the message from the oxygen
Mmmaking a list find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right facts are useful in emergencies


The feeling returns whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head looking around inside
Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts dont come with points of view
Facts dont do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of things
