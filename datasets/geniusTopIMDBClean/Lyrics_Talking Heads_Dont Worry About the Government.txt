I see the clouds that move across the sky
I see the wind that moves the clouds away
It moves the clouds over by the building
I pick the building that I want to live in
I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods
I see the pinecones that fall by the highway
Thats the highway that goes to the building
I pick the building that I want to live in
Its over there its over there
My building has every convenience
Its gonna make life easy for me
Its gonna be easy to get things done
I will relax along with my loved ones
Loved ones loved ones visit the building
Take the highway park and come up and see me
Ill be working working but if you come visit
Ill put down what Im doing my friends are important
Dont you worry bout me
I wouldnt worry about me
Dont you worry bout me
Dont you worry bout me
I see the states across this big nation
I see the laws made in Washington DC
I think of the ones I consider my favorites
I think of the people that are working for me
Some civil servants are just like my loved ones
They work so hard and they try to be strong
Im a lucky guy to live in my building
They own the buildings to help them along


Its over there its over there
My building has every convenience
Its gonna make life easy for me
Its gonna be easy to get things done
I will relax along with my loved ones
Loved ones loved ones visit the building
Take the highway park and come up and see me
Ill be working working but if you come visit
Ill put down what Im doing my friends are important
I wouldnt worry bout me
I wouldnt worry about me
Dont you worry bout me
Dont you worry bout me
