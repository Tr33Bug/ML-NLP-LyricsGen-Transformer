And all I see is little dots
Some are smeared and some are spots
Feel like murder but thats alright
Somebody said theres too much light
Pull down the shade and its alright
Itll be over in a minute or two
Im charged up dont put me down
Dont feel like talking dont mess around
I feel mean I feel okay
Im charged up electricity
The boys are making a big mess
This makes the girls start to laugh
I dont know what theyre talking about
The boys are worried the girls are shocked
They pick the sound and let it drop
Nobody knows what theyre talking about
Im charged up Im kinda wooden
Im barely moving I study motion
I steady myself I fooled myself
Im charged up its pretty intense
Im charged up dont put me down
Dont feel like talking dont mess around
I feel mean but I feel okay
Im charged up electricity
Thats what I call it
Ahhah
