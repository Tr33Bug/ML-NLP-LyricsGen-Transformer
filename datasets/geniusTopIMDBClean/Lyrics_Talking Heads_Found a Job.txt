Damn that television what a bad picture
Dont get upset its not a major disaster
Theres nothing on tonight he said I dont know whats the matter
Nothings ever on she said so I dont know why you bother
Weve heard this little scene weve heard it many times
People fighting over little things and wasting precious time
They might be better off I think the way it seems to me
Making up their own shows which might be better than TV
Judys in the bedroom inventing situations
Bob is on the street today scouting up locations
Theyve enlisted all their family
Theyve enlisted all their friends
It helped save their relationship
And made it work again
Their show gets real high ratings they think they have a hit
There might even be a spinoff but theyre not sure bout that
If they ever watch TV again itd be too soon for them
Bob never yells about the picture now hes having too much fun
Judys in the bedroom inventing situations
Bob is on the street today scouting up locations
Theyve enlisted all their family
Theyve enlisted all their friends
It helped save their relationship
And made it work again
So think about this little scene apply it to your life
If your work isnt what you love then something isnt right
Just think of Bob and Judy theyre happy as can be
Inventing situations putting them on TV
Judys in the bedroom inventing situations
Bob is on the street today hes having a vacation
Theyve enlisted all their family
Theyve enlisted all their friends
It helped save their relationship
And made it work again
Hit it
