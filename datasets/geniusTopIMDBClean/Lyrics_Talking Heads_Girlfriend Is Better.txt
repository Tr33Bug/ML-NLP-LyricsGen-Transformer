I who took the money
Who took the money away
I I I I its always showtime
Here at the edge of the stage
I I I wake up and wonder
What was the place what was the name
We wanna wait but here we go again
I takes over slowly
But doesnt last very long
I I I I no need to worry
Everythings under control
OUT but no hard feelings
What do you know Take you away
Were being taken for a ride again
I got a girlfriend thats better than that
She has the smoke in her eyes
Shes coming up going right through my heart
Shes gonna give me surprise
I think its right better than this
I think you can if you like
I got a girlfriend with bows in her hair
And nothing is better than that  is it 
Down down in the basement
We hear the sound of machines
I I Im driving in circles
Come to my senses sometimes
Why why why why start it over
Nothing was lost everythings free
I dont care how impossible it seems
Somebody calls you but you cannot hear
Get closer to be far away
And only one look and thats all that it takes
Maybe thats all that we need
All that it takes Ill bet its right
All it takes if its right
I got a girlfriend thats better than that
And she goes wherever she likes  there she goes 
I got a girlfriend thats better than that
Now everyones getting involved
Shes moving up going right through my heart
We might not ever get caught
Going right through try to stay cool
Going through staying cool
I got a girlfriend shes better than that
And nothing is better than you  wait a minute 
I got a girlfriend thats better than this
But you dont remember at all
As we get older and stop making sense
You wont find her waiting long
Stop making sense stop making sense
Stop making sense making sense
I got a girlfriend shes better than that
And nothing is better than this  is it
