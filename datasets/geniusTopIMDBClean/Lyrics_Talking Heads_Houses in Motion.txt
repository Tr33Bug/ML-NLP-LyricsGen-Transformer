For a long time I felt without style or grace
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew Id be able to do these things
And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where hes at
He cant afford to stop that is what he believe
Hell keep on digging for a thousand years
Im walking a line Im thinking about empty motion
Im walking a line just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way no time to begin
This isnt the time so nothing was done
Not talking about not many at all
Im turning around no trouble at all
You notice theres nothing around you around you
Im walking a line divide and dissolve
Never get to say much never get to talk
Tell us a little bit but not too much
Right about then is where she give up
She has closed her eyes she has give up hope
Im walking a line I hate to be dreaming in motion
Im walking a line just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way no time to begin
This isnt the time so nothing was done
Not talking about not many at all
Im turning around no trouble at all
Im keeping my fingers behind me hind me
Im walking a line divide and dissolve


I turn myself around Im moving backwards and forwards
Im moving twice as much as I was before
Ill keep on digging to the center of the Earth
Ill be down in there moving the in the room
Im walking a line Im visiting houses in motion
Im walking a line just barely enough to be living
Get outta the way no time to begin
This isnt the time so nothing was done
Not talking about not many at all
Im turning around no trouble at all
Two different houses surround you round you
Im walking a line divide and dissolve
