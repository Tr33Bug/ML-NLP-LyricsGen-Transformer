Okay
Pretty
What is brand new Its not what I think of you
Youll touch me in a minute but thats not what I want to do
We are two strangers we might never have met
We can talk forever I understand what you said
But Im not in love
What does it take to fall in love
Do people really fall in love
You know it
Is there time for this Is this responsibility
Girl time boy time is that the difference between you and me
I wont ask any questions who needs to make a new start
I choose to believe you I said before that I cant
Cause Im not in love
What does it take to fall in love
Do people really fall in love
Feelings
Take it easy baby dont let your feelings get in the way
I believe someday well live in a world without love
I can answer your questions if you wont twist what I say
Please respect my opinions they will be respected some day
But I dont need love
Therell come a day when we wont need love
I believe that we dont need love
