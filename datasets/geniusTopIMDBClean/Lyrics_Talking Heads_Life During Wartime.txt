Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons
Packed up and ready to go
Heard of some gravesites out by the highway
A place where nobody knows
The sound of gunfire off in the distance
Im getting used to it now
Lived in a brownstone lived in the ghetto
Ive lived all over this town
This aint no party this aint no disco
This aint no fooling around
No time for dancing or loveydovey
I aint got time for that now
Transmit the message to the receiver
Hope for an answer some day
I got three passports a couple of visas
You dont even know my real name
High on a hillside the trucks are loading
Everythings ready to roll
I sleep in the daytime and I work in the nighttime
I might not ever get home
This aint no party this aint no disco
This aint no fooling around
This aint no Mudd Club or CBGB
I aint got time for that now
Heard about Houston Heard about Detroit
Heard about Pittsburgh P A
You oughta know not to stand by the window
Somebodyll see you up there
I got some groceries some peanut butter
To last a couple of days
But I aint got no speakers aint got no headphones
Aint got no records to play


Why stay in college Why go to night school
Gonna be different this time
Cant write a letter cant send no postcard
I aint got time for that now
Trouble in transit got through the roadblock
We blended in with the crowd
We got computers were tapping phone lines
I know that that aint allowed
We dress like students we dress like housewives
Or in a suit and a tie
I changed my hairstyle so many times now
I dont know what I look like
You make me shiver I feel so tender
We make a pretty good team
Dont get exhausted Ill do some driving
You ought to get you some sleep
Burned all my notebooks what good are notebooks
They wont help me survive
My chest is aching burns like a furnace
The burning keeps me alive
