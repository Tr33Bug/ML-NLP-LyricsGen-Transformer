When my love
Stands next to your love
I cant compare love
When its not love
Its not love
Its not love
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire
On fire
When my love
Stands next to your love
I cant define love
When its not love
Its not love
Its not love
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire
Ive got two loves
Ive got two loves
And they go tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet like little birds
Theyre my two loves
And they go tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet like little birds
Theyre my two loves
Count em one two loves
Count em one two loves
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire
On fire

When my love
Stands next to your love
I cant define love
When its not love
Oh
Its not love
Its not love
Which is my face
Which is a building
Which is on fire
