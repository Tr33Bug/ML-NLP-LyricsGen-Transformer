Everybody get in line
Nothing can come between us
Nothin gets you down
Nothing strikes your fancy
Nothing turns you on
Somebody is waiting in the hallway
Somebody is falling down the stairs
Set someone free break someones heart
Stand up help us out
Everything is divided
Nothing is complete
Everything looks impressive
Do not be deceived
You dont have to wait for more instructions
No one makes a monkey out of me
We lie on our backs feet in the air
Rest and relaxation rocket to my brain
Snap into position
Bounce till you ache
You step out of line and
And you end up in jail
Bring me a doctor
I have a hole in my head
But they are just people
And Im not afraid
Doctor Doctor
We have nothing in our pockets
We continue
But we have nothing left to offer
Faces pressed against the window
Hey they are just my friends
Check this out dont be so slick
Break our backs it goes like this

We are born without eyesight
We are born without sin
And our mama protects us
From the cold and the rain
Were in no hurry
Sugar and spice
We sing in the darkness
And we open our eyes  open up 
Oh I cant believe it
And people are strange
Our presidents crazy
Did you hear what he said
Business and pleasure
Lie right to your face
Divide it in sections
And then give it away
There are no big secrets
Dont believe what you read
We have great big bodies
We got great big heads
Runarunarun it all together
Check it out still dont make no sense
Makin flippy floppy tryin to do my best
Lock the door we kill the beast
Kill it
