Do you remember anyone here
No you dont remember anything at all
Im sleeping Im flat on my back
Never woke up had no regrets
Theres a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
Theres a party up there all the time
And theyll party til they drop
Other people can go home
Everybody else can split
Ill be here all the time
I can never quit
Take a walk through the land of shadows
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Dont look so disappointed
It isnt what you hoped for is it
Theres a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
Im stuck here in this seat
I might not stand up
Other people can go home
Other people they will split
Ill be here all the time
I can never quit
Everything is very quiet
Everyone has gone to sleep
Im wide awake on memories
These memories cant wait
These memories cant wait
These memories cant wait
These memories cant wait ooh
Cant wait  These memories cant wait
Cant wait  These memories cant wait
Cant wait  These memories cant wait
Cant wait
