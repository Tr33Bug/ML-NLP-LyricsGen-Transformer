Time wont change you
Money wont change you
I havent got the faintest idea
Everything seems to be up in the air at this point
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
I need something to change your mind
Drugs wont change you
Religion wont change you  Whats a matter with you 
I havent got the faintest idea
Everything seems to be up in the air at this time
I need something to change your mind  Mind 
I need something to change your mind  Mind 
I need something to change your mind  Mind 
I need something to change your mind  Mind 
Science wont change you
Looks like I cant change you
I try to talk to you to to make things clear
But youre not even listening to me
And it comes directly from my heart to you
I need something to change your mind  Mind 
I need something to change your mind  Mind 
I need something to change your mind  Mind 
I need something to change your mind  Mind
