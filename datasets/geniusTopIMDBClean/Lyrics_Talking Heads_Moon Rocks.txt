Flying saucers levitation
Yo I could do that
Gettin ready for heavy duty
Go on give it a chance
Give it a chance give it a chance
I saw your hair start to curl
So get up write it down
You better wait for a while
So take your hands out of your pockets and get your face adjusted
I heard it somebody lied
And Im staring out the window gonna let this thing continue
In its natural time
Round heads square heads
Get settled in
You can hear my belly rumble
Theres a voice that starts to mumble
Woo Its starting to sing
Protons neutrons
I ate a rock from the moon
Got shocked once shocked twice
Lets see what it can do
A man in the moon a moon in the man
I got a rock in my throat
Upside upside down
My tummy start to talk  what it say 
Gonna rock it till I shock it gonna kick it till I drop it
Woo love at first sight
You can kick it you can poke it woo I think you broke it
Ooh what about that
Skin from a snake blood from a stone
You know that aint no lie
I got hundreds of expressions try to make a good impression
Woo Right between the eye
I dont mind let me go
Right on time I dont know
Let me be why not stay
I feel numb let me play
I got wild imagination talkin transubstantiation
Any version will do
I got mass communication Im the human corporation
I ate a rock from the moon
Moon in the rock rock in the moon
Theres a moon in my throat
You might think Im wasting time you might laugh but not for long
Hey Im working it out  work it out 
I dont mind let me go
Sounds inside I dont know
Let me be why not stay
I feel numb let me play
