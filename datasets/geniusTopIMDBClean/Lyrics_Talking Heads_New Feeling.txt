Its not yesterday anymore
I go visiting I talk loud
I try to make myself clear
In front of a face thats nearer
Than its ever been before
Not this close before
Nearer than before
Not this close before
It is a million years ago
I hear music and it sounds like bells
I feel like my head is high
I wish I could meet everyone
Meet them all over again
Bring them up to my room
Meet them all over again
Everyones up in my room
And now Im busy again
I feel like sitting down
But Im still thinking about my friends
In my guarded moments
But now Im speaking out
Speaking about my friends
Now Im speaking out
Thinking about my friends
