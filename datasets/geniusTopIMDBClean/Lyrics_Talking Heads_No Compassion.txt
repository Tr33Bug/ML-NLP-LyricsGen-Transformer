In a world where people have problems
In this world where decisions are a way of life
Other peoples problems they overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue but I dont have the time
So many people have their problems
Im not interested in their problems
I guess Ive experienced some problems
But now Ive made some decisions and
It takes a lot of time to push away the nonsense
Take my compassion push it as far as it goes
My interest levels dropping my interest level is dropping
Ive heard all I want to and I dont want to hear any more
What are you in love with your problems
I think you take it a little too far
Its not so cool to have so many problems
But dont expect me to explain your indecisions
Go talk to your analyst isnt that what theyre paid for
You walk you talk you still function like you used to
Its not a question of your personality or style
Be a little more selfish it might do you some good
In a world where people have problems
In this world where decisions are a way of life
Other peoples problems they overwhelm my mind
They say compassion is a virtue but I dont have the time
Here we go again
