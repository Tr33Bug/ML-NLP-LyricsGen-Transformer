Nothing But  Flowers Lyrics
Here we stand
Like an Adam and Eve
Waterfalls
Garden of Eden
Two fools in love
So beautiful and strong
Birds in the trees
Are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs cars have run on gasoline
Where Where have they gone
Now its nothing but flowers
There was a factory
Now there are mountains and rivers
Youve got it youve got it
We caught a rattlesnake
Now weve got something for dinner
Youve got it youve got it
There was a shopping mall
Now its all covered with flowers
Youve got it youve got it
If this is paradise
I wish I had a lawn mower
Youve got it youve got it
Years ago
I was an angry young man
Id pretend
That I was a billboard
Standing tall
By the side of the road
I fell in love
With the beautiful highway
This used to be real estate now its only fields and trees
Where Where is the town
Now its nothing but flowers
The highways and cars
Were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that wed start over
But I guess I was wrong
Once there were parking lots
Now its a peaceful oasis
Youve got it youve got it
This was a Pizza Hut
Now its all covered with daises
Youve got it youve got it
I miss the honky tonks
Dairy Queens and 7Elevens
Youve got it youve got it
And as things fell apart
Nobody paid much attention
Youve got it youve got it
I dream of cherry pies
Candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
Youve got it youve got it
We used to microwave
Now we just eat nuts and berries
Youve got it youve got it
This was a discount store
Now its turned into a cornfield
Youve got it youve got it
Dont leave me stranded here
I cant get used to this lifestyle
