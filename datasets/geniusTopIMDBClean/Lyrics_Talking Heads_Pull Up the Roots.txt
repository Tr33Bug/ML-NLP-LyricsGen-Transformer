Hello again
Yes indeed my friend
I can tell
Gonna get together again
I could be right I could be wrong
I feel nice when I sing this song
And I dont mind
Whatever happens is fine
Baby likes to keep on playing
What do I know what do I know
Wilder than the place we live in
Ill take you there Ill take you there
I dont mind some slight disorder
Pull up the roots pull up the roots
And I know every living creature
Pull up the roots pull up the roots
And I know you
I understand what you do
Yes indeed
I put the hat on my head
Come out of your mess bring yourself in
I feel nice when I start to sing
And I can see
Everyone else is like me
Towns that disappeared completely
Pull up the roots pull up the roots
Miles and miles of endless highway
Pull up the roots pull up the roots
Colored lights and shiny curtains
Ill take you there Ill take you there
Everything has been forgiven
Pull up the roots pull up the roots
Well I have a good time when I go out of my mind
And its a wonderful place and I cant wait to be there
And I hear beautiful sounds coming out of the ground
Gonna take us a while but well go hundreds of times
Baby likes to keep on playing
What dyou know What dyou know
Wilder than the place we live in
Ill take you there Ill take you there
And I dont mind some slight disorder
Pull up the roots pull up the roots
And no more time for talkin it over
Pull up the roots pull up the roots
Well I have a good time when I go out of my mind
And its a wonderful place and I cant wait to be there
And I hear beautiful sounds coming out of the ground
Someone must have been high but I guess its alright
