Mommy Daddy come and look at me now
Im a big man in a great big town
Years ago who would believe its true
Goes to show what a little faith can do
I was complaining I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now cause you pulled me up
Pulled me up up up up up up up up
I slipped and I got pulled pulled up
I tripped and then you pulled you pulled me up
I slipped and I got pulled pulled up
I slipped and then you pulled you pulled me up
Pulled me upup pulled me upupupah
Pulled me up up up up up up up up
I drift away to another land
Sleeping dreaming such a simple thing
I think of things that I might be
I see my name go down in history
I was complaining I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now cause you pulled me up
Pulled me up up up up up up up up
I slipped and I got pulled pulled up
I tripped and then you pulled you pulled me up
I tripped and I got pulled pulled up
I slipped and then you pulled you pulled me up

Dark and savage with a profile so sharp
Keep that wonderful food on the table

I feel so strong now cause you pulled me up
Pulled me up up up up up up up up
