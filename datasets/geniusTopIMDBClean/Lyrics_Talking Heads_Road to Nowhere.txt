Well we know where were going
But we dont know where weve been
And we know what were knowing
But we cant say what weve seen
And were not little children
And we know what we want
And the future is certain
Give us time to work it out
Yeah
Were on a road to nowhere
Come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere
Well take that ride
Im feeling okay this morning
And you know
Were on the road to paradise
Here we go here we go
Were on a ride to nowhere
Come on inside
Taking that ride to nowhere
Well take that ride
Maybe you wonder where you are
I dont care
Here is where time is on our side
Take you there take you there
Were on a road to nowhere
Were on a road to nowhere
Were on a road to nowhere
Theres a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And its all right baby its all right
And its very far away
But its growing day by day
And its all right baby its all right
Would you like to come along
You can help me sing the song
And its all right baby its all right
They can tell you what to do
But theyll make a fool of you
And its all right baby its all right
Theres a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And its all right baby its all right
And its very far away
But its growing day by day
And its all right baby its all right
Would you like to come along
You can help me sing the song
And its all right baby its all right
They can tell you what to do
But theyll make a fool of you
And its all right baby its all right
Were on a road to nowhere
Were on a road to nowhere
Were on a road to nowhere
Were on a road to nowhere
