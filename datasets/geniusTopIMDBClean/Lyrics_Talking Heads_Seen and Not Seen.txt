He would see faces in movies on TV in magazines and in books
He thought that some of these faces might be right for him
And that through the years by keeping an ideal facial structure fixed in his mind
Or somewhere in the back of his mind
That he might by force of will cause his face to approach those of his ideal
The change would be very subtle
It might take ten years or so
Gradually his face would change its shape
A more hooked nose
Wider thinner lips
Beady eyes
A larger forehead
He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people
They had also molded their faces according to some ideal
Maybe they imagined that their new face
Would better suit their personality
Or maybe they imagined that their personality
Would be forced to change to fit the new appearance
This is why first impressions are often correct
Although some people might have made mistakes
They may have arrived at an appearance
That bears no relationship to them
They may have picked an ideal appearance
Based on some childish whim or momentary impulse
Some may have gotten halfway there
And then changed their minds
He wonders if he too might have made a similar mistake
