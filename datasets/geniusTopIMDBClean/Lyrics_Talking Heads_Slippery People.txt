What about the time you were rollin over
Fall on your face you must be having fun
Walk lightly think of a time
Youd best believe this thing is real
Put away that gun this part is simple
Try to recognize what is in your mind
God help us help us to surmise
These slippery people help us understand
Whats the matter with him  Hes alright 
I see his face  The Lord wont mind 
Dont play no games  Hes alright 
Look from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel  Hes alright 
See for yourself  The Lord wont mind 
Were gonna move  Right now 
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
I remember when sittin in the tub
Pulled out the plug the water was runnin out
Cool down stop actin crazy
Theyre gonna leave and well be on our own
Seven times five they were living creatures
Watch em come to life right before your eyes
Backsliding how do you do
These slippery people gonna see you through
Whats the matter with him  Hes alright 
How do you know  The Lord wont mind 
No no no games  Hes alright 
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel  Hes alright 
See for yourself  The Lord wont mind 
Were gonna move  Right now 
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
Whats the matter with him  Hes alright 
I see his face  The Lord wont mind 
How do you know  Hes alright 
And were going to the top
Turn like a wheel  Hes alright 
See for yourself  The Lord wont mind 
Were gonna move  Right now 
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
Whats the matter with him  Hes alright 
I see his face  The Lord wont mind 
How do you know  Hes alright 
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel  Hes alright 
See for yourself  The Lord wont mind 
Were gonna move  Right now 
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
