Mommy had a little baby
There he is fast asleep
Hes just a little plaything
Why not wake him up
Cute cute little baby
Little pee pee little toes
Now hes comin to me
Crawl across the kitchen floor
Baby baby please let me hold him
I wanna make him stay up all night
Sister sister hes just a plaything
We wanna make him stay up all night
Yeah we do
See him drink from a bottle
See him eat from a plate
Cute cute as a button
Dont you wanna make him stay up late
And were having fun with no money
Little smile on his face
Dont you love the little baby
Dont you want to make him stay up late
Baby baby please let me hold him
I wanna make him stay up all night
Sister sister hes just a plaything
We wanna make him stay up all night
Here we go  all night long 
Sister sister  all night long 
In the playpen woo  all night long 
Little baby goes ha  all night long 
I know you want to leave me
Why dont we pretend
There you go little man
Cute cute why not
Late at night wake him up
Baby baby please let me hold him
I wanna make him stay up all night
Sister sister hes just a plaything
We wanna make him stay up all night
Here we go ha  all night long 
Sister sister woo With the television on
Little baby goes woo  all night long 
Hey hey baby  all night long 
And he looks so cute  all night long 
In his little red suit  all night long 
Rock on  all night long 
All night long
All night long
All night long
