That was all
Heh heh
Now let me tell you a story
The devil he has a plan
A bag of bones in his pocket
Get anything you want
No dust and no rocks
The whole thing is over
All those beauties in solid motion
All those beauties gonna swallow you up
Lets go
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi
One time too many too far to go
I we come to take you home
Woo hoo
And when they split those atoms
Its hotter than the sun
Blood is a special substance
And they gonna pray for that man
So wake up young lovers
The whole thing is over
Watch out touch monkeys
All that blood is gonna swallow you whole
Lets go
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi
Whats that Whos driving
Where we goin Who knows
I we come to take you home
Woo hoo
How many people do you think I am
Pretend I am somebody else
You can pretend Im an old millionaire
A millionaire washing his hands
Rattle them bones dreams that stick out
A medical chart on the wall
Soft violins hands touch your throat
Everyone wants to explode
Now when your hands get dirty
Nobody knows you at all
Dont have a window to slip out of
Lights on nobody home
Click click see you later
Beta beta no time to rest
Pika pika risky business
All that blood will never cover that mess
Lets go
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi
So soft hard feelings
No tricks lets go
I we come to take you home
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi hi hi hi hi hi
Hi
