I dont know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money my cigarettes
I havent seen the worst of it yet
I wanna know can you tell me
Am I in love to stay
Take me to the river drop me in the water
Take me to the river dip me in the water
Washing me down washing me down
I dont know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I cant forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret
I wanna know can you tell me
Am I in love to stay
Take me to the river drop me in the water
Push me in the river dip me in the water
Washing me down washing me
Hug me squeeze me love me tease me
Till I cant till I cant I cant take no more
Dip me in the water drop me in the river
Push me in the water drop me in the river
Washing me down washing me down
I dont know why I love her like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I the biggest fool of them all


I wanna know can you tell me
Am I in love to stay
Take me to the river drop me in the water
Dip me in the river drop me in the water
Washing me down washing me down
