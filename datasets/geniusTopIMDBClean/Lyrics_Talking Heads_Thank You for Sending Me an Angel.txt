Oh baby you can walk you can talk just like me
You can walk you can talk just like me
You can look tell me what you see
You can look you wont see nothing like me
If you look around the world
Waoh waoh waoh waoh waoh waoh
Oh baby you can walk you can talk just like me
With a little practice you can walk you can talk just like me
If thats what you wanna do
Well you can look youll walk in circles around me
But first Ill walk in circles round you
But first I walk around the world
Im walking around the world here we go
Ayayayayayaya
You can walk a little Ill walk in circles around you
But first show me what you can do
