I see the shapes I remember from maps
I see the shoreline I see the whitecaps
A baseball diamond nice weather down there
I see the school and the houses where the kids are
Places to park by the factories and buildings
Restaurants and bars for later in the evening
Then we come to the farmlands and the undeveloped areas
And I have learned how these things work together
I see the parkway that passes through them all
And I have learned how to look at these things and I say
I wouldnt live there if you paid me
I wouldnt live like that no sirree
I wouldnt do the things the way those people do
I wouldnt live there if you paid me to
I guess its healthy I guess the air is clean
I guess those people have fun with their neighbors and friends
Look at that kitchen and all of that food
Look at them eat it I guess it tastes real good
They grow it in those farmlands then they bring it to the store
They put it in the car trunk then they bring it back home and I say
I wouldnt live there if you paid me
I wouldnt live like that no sirree
I wouldnt do the things the way those people do
I wouldnt live there if you paid me to
Im tired of looking out the window of the airplane
Im tired of traveling I want to be somewhere
And its not even worth talking
About those people down there going
