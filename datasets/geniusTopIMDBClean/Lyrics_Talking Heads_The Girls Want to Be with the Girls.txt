Girls dont want to play like that
Just want to talk to the boys
Just want to do whats in their hearts
And the girls want to be with the girls
And the boys say What do you mean
And the boys say What do you mean
Well theres just no love
When theres boys and girls
And the girls want to be with the girls
Girls want to be with the girls
Girls want things that make common sense
The best for all concerned
Dont want to have to go out of their way
And the girls want to be with the girls
Girls are getting into abstract analysis
Would like to make that intuitive leap
Theyre making plans that have farreaching effects
And the girls want to be with the girls
And the boys say What do you mean
And the boys say What do you mean
Well theres just no love
When theres boys and girls
And the girls want to be with the girls
Yes the girls want to be with the girls
Watch when they go
