Sometimes the world has a load of questions
Seems like the world knows nothing at all
The world is near but its out of reach
Some people touch it but they cant hold on
She is moving to describe the world
Night must fall now Darker Darker 
She has got to move the world got to move the world got to move the world 
She has messages for everyone
Night must fall now Darker Darker 
She has got to move the world got to move the world got to move the world 
She is moving by remote control
Night must fall now Darker Darker 
She has got to move the world got to move the world got to move the world 
Hands that guide her are invisible
Night must fall now Darker Darker 
She has got to move the world got to move the world got to move the world 
The world has a way of looking at people
Sometimes we feel that the world is wrong
She loves the world and all the people in it
She shakes em up when she start to walk
She is only partly human being
