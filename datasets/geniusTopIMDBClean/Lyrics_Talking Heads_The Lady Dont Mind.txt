Last time she jumped out the window
Well she only turned and smiled
You might think she would say something
But youd have to wait a while
Well the lady dont mind
No no no the lady dont mind
She just turns her head and disappears
And I kinda like that style
Little boat that floats on a river
Its drifting through a haze
She floats by whenever she wants to
Well there she goes again
Well its no trouble at all
No no no trouble at all
Well what she does is all right with me
And I kinda like that style
Come on come on I go up and down
I like this curious feeling
I know I see its like make believe
Cover your ears so you can hear what Im saying
Im not lost but I dont know where I am
I got a question
All right all right this is what we like
Who knows who knows what Im thinking
She says love is not what shes after
But everybody knows
Each time she looks in the mirror
Well she lets her feelings show
Well the lady dont mind
No no no the lady dont mind
She just turns around and disappears
And I kinda like that style
Uhoh uhoh here we go again
I dont know dont know what Im sayin
Hey man hey man I sure dont feel the same
She likes to say what shes feeling
Hey did I get a big surprise
I know you think so
Come on come on she says anything
Who knows who knows what shes thinking
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
Uhoh uhoh
