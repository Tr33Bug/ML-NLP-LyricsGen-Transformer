This Must Be the Place  Naive Melody  Lyrics
Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me around
I feel numb born with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Well make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground head in the sky
Its okay I know nothings wrong nothing
Hiyeah I got plenty of time
Hiyeah you got light in your eyes
And youre standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money always for love
Cover up and say goodnight say goodnight
Home is where I want to be
But I guess Im already there
I come home she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I cant tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks this is where Ill be where Ill be
Hiyeah we drift in and out
Hiyeah sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
Im just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me til my heart stops
Love me til Im dead
Eyes that light up eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots hit me on the head I go
Ooh
