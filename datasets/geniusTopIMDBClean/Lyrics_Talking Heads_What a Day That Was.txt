Well Im dressed up so nice
An Im doin my best
Yes Im startin over
Startin over in another place
Lemme tell you a story
Big chief with a golden crown
Hes got rings on his fingers
And he walks up up to the throne
Hes makin shapes with his hands
An dont you dare sit back
Now dont you dare sit down
And dont you dare speak up
And on the first day we had everything we could stand
Who could have asked for more
And on the second day there was nothing else left to do
Ooh what a day that was
Well there are 50000 beggars
Roaming in the streets
And they have lost all their possessions
They have nothing left to eat
Down come a bolt of lightning
Start an electrical storm
And starts a chain reaction
Go pull a fire alarm
I said I Im dreaming of a city
It was my own invention
And I put the wheels in motion
A time for big decisions
And on the first day we had everything we could stand
Ooh and then we let it fall
And on the second day there was nothing else left at all
Ooh what a day that was
Oh a day that was
Ooh thats the way it goes
Theres a million ways to get things done
Threes a million ways to make things work out
Well Im going right through
And the light came down
Well theyre roundin em up
From all over the town
Theyre movin forward and backwards
Theyre movin backwards and front
And theyre enjoying themselves
Moving in every direction
And if you feel like youre in a whirlpool
You feel like going home
You feel like talking to someone
Who knows the difference between right and wrong
Oh and on the first day we had everything we could stand
Ooh and then we let it fall
And on the second day there was nothing else left at all
Ooh what a day that was
Were goin boom boom boom
And thats the way we live
And in a great big room
And thats the way we live
Were goin boom boom boom
And thats the way we live
And in a great big room
And thats the way we live
Were goin boom boom boom
And thats the way we live
And in a great big room
And thats the way we live
Were goin boom boom boom
And thats the way we live
And in a great big room
And thats the way we live
