Im wearing fur pajamas
I ride a hot potato
Its tickling my fancy
Speak up I cant hear you
Here on this mountain top ohohoh
I got some wild wild life
I got some news to tell you ohoh
About some wild wild life
Here come the doctor in charge ohohoh
Shes got some wild wild life
Aint that the way you like it ohoh
Living wild wild life
I wrestle with your conscience
You wrestle with your partner
Sitting on a windowsill
But he spends his time behind closed doors
So check out mister businessman ohohoh
He bought some wild wild life
On the way to the stock exchange ohohoh
He got some wild wild life
Break it up when he opens the door ohohoh
He doing wild wild life
I know its the way you like it ohoh
Living wild wild
Peace of mind
Its a piece of cake
Thought control
You get on board any time you like
Like sitting on pins and needles
Things fall apart
Its scientific
Sleeping on the Interstate ohohoh
Getting wild wild life
Checking in and checking out ohohoh
I got em wild wild life
Spending all of my money and time ohohoh
On too much wild wild life
We wanna go and we go where we go ohohoh
Ah doing wild wild life

Take a picture here in the daylight ohoh
And its a wild wild life
Youve grown so tall youve grown so fast ohohoh
Wild wild
And I know thats the way you like it ohoh
Living wild wild wild wild life
