All I wanna do
Is always bring good to you
To give you all the love I can
And help you in whatever you do
Sure as the sun will come around again
To start off another day
You can be sure that in my heart and soul
Ill love you in every way
All I wanna do
Is bring happiness to you
I hope it makes you happy to know
My loves with you wherever you go
Ooh when I sit and close my eyes
A gentle thought comes in my mind
My love is burning brightly  burning brightly 
Like moon and stars shine nightly
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Oh let these little words of love
Come romance and light your way
My love is burning brightly  burning brightly 
Like moon and stars shine nightly
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
My love is burning brightly 
Like moon and stars shine brightly
