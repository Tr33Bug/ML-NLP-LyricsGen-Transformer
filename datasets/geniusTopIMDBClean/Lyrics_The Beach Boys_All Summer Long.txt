Sitting in my car outside your house
Sitting in my car outside your house 
Remember when you spilled coke all over you blouse
Tshirts cutoffs and a pair of thongs
Tshirts cutoffs and a pair of thongs 
Weve been having fun all summer long
All summer long youve been with me 
I cant see enough of you
All summer long weve both been free 
Wont be long until summer time is through
Summer time is through 
Not for us now
Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills
Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills 
When we rode the horse we got some thrills
Every now and then we hear our song
Every now and then we hear our song 
Weve been having fun all summer long
Wont be long until summer time is through
Summer time is through 
Not for us now
Every now and then we hear our song
Every now and then we hear our song 
Weve been having fun all summer long
Weve been having fun all summer long
Weve been having fun all summer long 
Weve been having fun all summer long
Weve been having fun all summer long 
Weve been having fun all summer long
