When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
Now whats the matter buddy
Aint you heard of my school
Its number one in the state
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school
I got a lettermans sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
Im proud to wear it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got a decal in back
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school
On Friday well be jacked up on the football game
And Ill be ready to fight
Were gonna smash em now
My girl will be working on her pompoms now
And shell be yelling tonight
So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school


Rah rah rah be true to your school
Rah rah rah be true to your school
Rah rah rah be true to your school
Rah rah rah be true to your school
Rah rah rah be true to your school
