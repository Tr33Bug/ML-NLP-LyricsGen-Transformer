Light the lamp and fire mellow
Cabin essence timely hello
Welcomes the time for a change
Lost and found you still remain there
Youll find a meadow filled with grain there
Ill give you a home on the range
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
Who ran the iron horse
I want to watch you windblown facing
Waves of wheat for your embracing
Folks sing a song of the grange
Nestle in a kiss below there
The constellations ebb and flow there
And witness our home on the range
Who ran the iron horse  Truck drivin man do what you can 
Who ran the iron horse  Hightail your load off the road 
Who ran the iron horse  Out of nightlife its a gas man 
Who ran the iron horse  I dont believe I gotta grieve 
Who ran the iron horse  Im outta luck 
Who ran the iron horse  with a buck and a booth 
Who ran the iron horse  Catchin on to the truth 
Who ran the iron horse  In the vast past the last gasp 
Who ran the iron horse  Land in the dust trust that you must 
Who ran the iron horse  Catch as catch can 
Have you seen the Grand Coolie working on the railroad
Have you seen the Grand Coolie working on the railroad
Have you seen the Grand Coolie working on the railroad
Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over the thresher and hover the wheat field
Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over the thresher and hover the wheat field
