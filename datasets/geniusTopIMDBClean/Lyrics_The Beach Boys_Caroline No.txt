Where did your long hair go
Where is the girl I used to know
How could you lose that happy glow
Oh Caroline no
Who took that look away
I remember how you used to say
Youd never change but thats not true
Oh Caroline you
Break my heart
I want to go and cry
Its so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh Caroline why
Could I ever find in you again
The things that made me love you so much then
Could we ever bring em back once they have gone
Oh Caroline no
