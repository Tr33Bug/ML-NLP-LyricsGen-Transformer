Oh keep dreamin of darlin 
Oohooh my darlin youre so fine 
Oh oh oh 
Dont know if words could say
But darlin Ill find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As lifes most precious part
Oh darlin  Oh keep dreamin of darlin 
I dream about you often my pretty darlin
Oohooh my darlin youre so fine 
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love uhhuh oh

Then I couldnt love but now I can
You pick me up when Im feelin sad
More soul than I ever had
Gonna love you every single night
Cause I think youre too outta sight
Ohoh darlin  Oh keep dreamin of darlin 
I dream about you often my pretty darlin
Oohooh my darlin youre so fine 
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love uhhuhhuh

Gonna love you every single night yes I will
Cause I think youre too doggone outta sight
Darlin  Oh keep dreamin of darlin 
I dream about you often my pretty darlin
Oohooh my darlin youre so fine 
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love uhhuh oh
