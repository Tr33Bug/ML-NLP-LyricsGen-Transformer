Disney Girls  1957  Lyrics
Clearing skies and drying eyes
Now I see your smile
Darkness goes and softness shows
A changing style
Just in time words that rhyme
Will bless your soul
Now Ill fill your hands
With kisses and a Tootsie Roll
Oh reality its not for me
And it makes me laugh
Oh fantasy world and Disney girls
Im coming back
Patti Page and summer days
On old Cape Cod
Happy times making wine
In my garage
Country shade and lemonade
Guess Im slowing down
Its a turned back world
With a local girl
In a smaller town
Open cars and clearer stars
Thats what Ive lacked oh
But fantasy world and Disney girls
Im coming back
Love  Hi Rick and Dave
Hi Pop good morning mom
Love  Get up guess what
Im in love with a girl I found
Shes really swell
Cause she likes
Church bingo chances
And oldtime dances


All my life I spent the night
With dreams of you
And the warmth I missed
And for the things I wished
Theyre all coming true
Ive got my love to give
And a place to live
Guess Im going to stay
Itd be a peaceful life
With a forever wife
And a kid someday
Well its earlier nights
And pillow fights
And your soft laugh oh
Fantasy world and Disney girls
Im coming back
