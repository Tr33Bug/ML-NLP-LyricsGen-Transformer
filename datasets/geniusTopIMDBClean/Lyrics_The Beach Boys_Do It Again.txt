Its automatic when I talk with old friends
The conversation turns to girls we knew
When their hair was soft and long
And the beach was the place to go
With suntanned bodies and waves of sunshine
The California girls and a beautiful coastline
And warmedup weather lets
Get together and do it again
Dododo dododo
Do dodododo
Dododo dododo
Do dodododo
Dododo dododo

Dododo dododo
Do dodododo
With a girl the lonely sea looks good
With moonlight
Makes your night times warm
And out of sight  Been so long 
Do do dododo  Been so long 
Do do dododo  So long been so long 
Been so long
Hey now hey now hey now hey now
Hey now hey now hey now hey now
Hey now hey now hey now hey now
Well Ive been thinking bout all the places
We surfed and danced and all the faces
We miss so lets get
Back together and do it again
Come and do it 
Dododo dododo
Do dodododo
Dododo dododo
Do dodododo
Dododo dododo
Dumdedooron
Dododo dododo
Do dodododo
Dododo dododo
Do dodododo
