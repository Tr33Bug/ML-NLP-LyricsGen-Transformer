Dont go near the water
Dont you think its sad
Whats happened to the water
Our waters going bad
Oceans rivers lakes and streams
Have all been touched by man
The poison floating out to sea
Now threatens life on land
Dont go near the water
Aint it sad
Whats happened to the water
Its going bad
Dont go near the water
Dont go near the water
Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath
So lets avoid an ecological aftermath
Beginning with me
Beginning with you
Dont go near the water
To do it any wrong
To be cool with the water
Is the message of this song
Lets all help the water
Right away
Do what we can and ought to
Lets start today
