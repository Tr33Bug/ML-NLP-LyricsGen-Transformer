Dont Talk  Put Your Head on My Shoulder  Lyrics
I can hear so much in your sighs
And I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say
But dont talk put your head on my shoulder
Come close close your eyes and be still
Dont talk take my hand and let me hear your heart beat
Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight
Lets not think about tomorrow
And dont talk put your head on my shoulder
Come close close your eyes and be still
Dont talk take my hand and listen to my heart beat
Listen listen listen
Dont talk put your head on my shoulder
Dont talk close your eyes and be still
Dont talk put your head on my shoulder
Dont talk close your eyes and be still
Dont talk put your head on my shoulder
