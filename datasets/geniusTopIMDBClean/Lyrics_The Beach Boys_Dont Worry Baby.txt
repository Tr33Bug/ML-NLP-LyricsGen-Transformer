Well its been building up inside of me for
Oh I dont know how long
I dont know why but I keep thinking
Somethings bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says  Dont worry baby 
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby 
Everything will turn out alright
Dont worry baby 
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby 
I guess I shouldve kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I cant back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says  Dont worry baby 
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby 
Everything will turn out alright
Dont worry baby 
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby 
She told me Baby when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says  Dont worry baby 
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby 
Everything will turn out alright
Dont worry baby 
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby 
Everything will turn out alright
Dont worry baby 
Dont worry baby
Dont worry baby 
Oohoohoohooooh
