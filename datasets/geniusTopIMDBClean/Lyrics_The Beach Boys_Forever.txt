If every word I said
Could make you laugh
Id talk forever  Together my love 
I ask the sky just what we had
It shone forever
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
Id sing forever  Together my love 
Forever forever
Ive been so happy loving you
Together my love
Let the love I have for you
Live in your heart
And beat forever  Together my love 
Forever forever
Ive been so happy loving you
Baby just let me sing it my baby
I want to be singing my baby
Baby baby baby baby my baby
I want to be singing my baby
So Im going away
But not forever
Im gonna love you in your way
Forever
