Well she got her daddys car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now
And shell have fun fun fun till her daddy takes the Tbird away
Fun fun fun till her daddy takes the Tbird away 
Well the girls cant stand her
Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
You walk like an ace now you walk like an ace 
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now
You look like an ace now you look like an ace 
A lot of guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
And shell have fun fun fun till her daddy takes the Tbird away
Fun fun fun till her daddy takes the Tbird away 
Well you knew all along
That your dad was getting wise to you now
You shouldnt have lied now you shouldnt have lied 
And since he took your set of keys
Youve been thinking that your fun is all through now
You shouldnt have lied now you shouldnt have lied 
But you can come along with me
Cause weve got a lot of things to do now
You shouldnt have lied now you shouldnt have lied 
And well have fun fun fun now that daddy took the Tbird away
Fun fun fun now her daddy took the Tbird away 
And well have fun fun fun now that daddy took the Tbird away
Fun fun fun now her daddy took the Tbird away
