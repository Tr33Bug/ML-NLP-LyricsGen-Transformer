I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
Ill make you so sure about it
God only knows what Id be without you
If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what Id be without you
Ooh ooh
Do do do do do do do
Bow buhbow buhbow buhbow  Do do do do 
Buhbow buhbow buhbow  Do do do do do do 
Buhbow buhbow buhbow buhbow  Do do do do do do do do 
God only knows what Id be without you
If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what Id be without you
God only knows what Id be without you
God only knows what Id be without you
God only knows what Id be without you  What Id be 
God only knows what Id be without you  God only knows 
God only knows what Id be without you  What Id be 
God only knows what Id be without you  God only knows 
God only knows what Id be without you  What Id be 
God only knows what Id be without you  God only knows 
God only knows what Id be without you  What Id be 
God only knows what Id be without you  God only knows 
God only knows what Id be without you  What Id be 
God only knows what Id be without you  God only knows
