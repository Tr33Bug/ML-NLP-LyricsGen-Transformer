II love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
Im pickin up good vibrations
Shes giving me excitations  Oom bop bop 
Im pickin up good vibrations  Good vibrations bop bop 
Shes giving me excitations  Excitations bop bop 
Im pickin up good vibrations  Good vibrations bop bop 
Shes giving me excitations  Excitations bop bop 
Im pickin up good vibrations  Good vibrations bop bop 
Shes giving me excitations  Excitations 
Close my eyes shes somehow closer now
Softly smile I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
Im pickin up good vibrations
Shes giving me excitations  Oom bop bop 
Im pickin up good vibrations  Good vibrations bop bop 
Shes giving me excitations  Excitations bop bop 
Im pickin up good vibrations  Good vibrations bop bop 
Shes giving me excitations  Excitations bop bop
