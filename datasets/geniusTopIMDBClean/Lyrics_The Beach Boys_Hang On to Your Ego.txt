I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that wont make them defensive
Hang on to your ego
Hang on but I know that youre gonna lose the fight
They come on like theyre peaceful
But inside theyre so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know Im guilty
Hang on to your ego
Hang on but I know that youre gonna lose the fight
Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know Im guilty
Hang on to your ego
Hang on but I know that youre gonna lose the fight
Bark 
Hey Chuck is it possible we could bring a horse in here without if we
Dont screw anything up
I beg your pardon
Honest to God now the horse is tamed and everything
