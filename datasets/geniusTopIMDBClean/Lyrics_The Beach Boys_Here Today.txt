It starts with just a little glance now
Right away youre thinkin bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just cant wait to get to know her
A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if youre not careful think about the pain it can bring
It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long
Youve got to keep in mind love is here today
And its gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast
Right now you think that shes perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But Im the guy she left before you found her
Well Im not saying you wont have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were
She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long
Youve got to keep in mind love is here today
And its gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast
Keep in mind love is here today
And its gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And its gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And its gone tomorrow
Its here and gone so fast
