I keep looking for a place to fit in
Where I can speak my mind
And Ive been trying hard to find the people
That I wont leave behind
They say I got brains but they aint doing me no good
I wish they could
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin for myself
But what goes wrong
Sometimes I feel very sad  Cundo ser 
Sometimes I feel very sad  Un da ser Aint found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into 
Sometimes I feel very sad  Oh cuando ser Aint found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into 
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
Whats it all about
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin for myself
But what goes wrong
Sometimes I feel very sad  Cundo ser 
Sometimes I feel very sad  Un da ser aint found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into 
Sometimes I feel very sad  Oh cundo ser Aint found the right thing  I can put my heart and soul into 
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
I guess I just wasnt made for these times
