I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that wont make them defensive
I know theres an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
They come on like theyre peaceful but inside theyre so uptight
They trip through their day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better
I know theres an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better
I know theres an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
