I came along when he broke your heart
Thats when you needed someone to help forget about him
I gave you love with a brand new start
Thats what you needed the most to set your broken heart free
I know you cried and you felt blue
But when I could I gave strength to you
Im waiting for the day when you can love again
I kissed your lips and when your face looked sad
It made me think about him and that you still loved him so
Baby dont you know  That pretty soon I made you feel glad
That you belonged to me and love began to show
He hurt you then but thats all gone
I guess Im saying youre the only one
Im waiting for the day when you can love again
He hurt you then but thats all done
I guess Im saying youre the only one
Im waiting for the day when you can love again
You didnt think no that I could sit around and let him work
You didnt think no that I could sit around and watch him take you
You didnt think that I could sit around and watch him go
You didnt think that I could sit back and let you go
You didnt think that I could sit around and let you go
