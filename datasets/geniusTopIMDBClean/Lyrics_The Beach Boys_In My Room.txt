Theres a world where I can go
And tell my secrets to
In my room
In my room  In my room 
In this world I lock out
All my worries and my fears
In my room
In my room  In my room 
Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday
Now its dark and Im alone
But I wont be afraid
In my room
In my room  In my room in my room 
In my room  In my room in my room
