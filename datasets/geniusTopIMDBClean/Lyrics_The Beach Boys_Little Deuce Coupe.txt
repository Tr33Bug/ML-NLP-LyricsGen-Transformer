Little deuce coupe
You dont know what I got  You dont know what I got 
Little deuce coupe
You dont know what I got
Well Im not bragging babe so dont put me down  deuce coupe 
But Ive got the fastest set of wheels in town  deuce coupe 
When something comes up to me he dont even try  deuce coupe 
Cause if I had a set of wings man I know she could fly
Shes my little deuce coupe
You dont know what I got
My little deuce coupe 
You dont know what I got 
Just a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill  deuce coupe 
But shell walk a Thunderbird like shes standing still  deuce coupe 
Shes ported and relieved and shes stroked and bored
Shell do a hundred and forty with the top end floored
Shes my little deuce coupe
You dont know what I got
My little deuce coupe 
You dont know what I got 
Shes got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that aint enough to make you flip your lid
Theres one more thing I got the pink slip daddy
And coming off the line when the light turns green  deuce coupe 
Well she blows them out of the water like you never seen  deuce coupe 
I get pushed out of shape and its hard to steer  deuce coupe 
When I get rubber in all four gears


Shes my little deuce coupe
You dont know what I got
My little deuce coupe 
You dont know what I got 
Shes my little deuce coupe
You dont know what I got
My little deuce coupe 
You dont know what I got 
Shes my little deuce coupe
You dont know what I got
