Little Saint Nick  1991 Remix  Lyrics
Oooo Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Oooo
Well way up north where the air gets cold
Theres a tale about Christmas that youve all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled
Its the little Saint Nick  Ooo little Saint Nick 
Its the little Saint Nick  Ooo little Saint Nick 
Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick  Ooo 
But shell walk a toboggan with a four speed stick  Ooo 
Shes candyapple red with a ski for a wheel  Ooo 
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel  Ooo 
Its the little Saint Nick  Ooo little Saint Nick 
Its the little Saint Nick  Ooo little Saint Nick 
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer  Woah woahoh 
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer
He dont miss no one
And hauling through the snow at a frightening speed  Ooo 
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead  Ooo 
Hes gotta wear his goggles because the snow really flies  Ooo 
And hes cruising every pad with a little surprise  Ooo 
Its the little Saint Nick  Ooo little Saint Nick 
Its the little Saint Nick  Ooo little Saint Nick 
Ohh Merry Christmas Saint Nick  Ooo 
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh Merry Christmas Saint Nick  Ooo 
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh Merry Christmas Saint Nick  Ooo 
Christmas comes this time each year
