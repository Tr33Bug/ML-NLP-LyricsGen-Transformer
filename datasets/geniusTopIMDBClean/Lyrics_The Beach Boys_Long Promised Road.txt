So hard to answer futures riddle when ahead is seeming so far behind
So hard to laugh a childlike giggle when the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar
But I hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks astumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Sew up the wounds of evolution and the now starts to get in my way
So what if lifes a revelation if the mind speaks of only today
So real the pain of growing in soul
Of climbing up to realitys goal
But I hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks astumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Long promised road
Trail starts at dawn carries on to the seasons ending
Long promised road
Flows to the source gentle force never ending never ending
So hard to lift the jeweled scepter when the weight turns a smile to a frown
So hard to drink of passion nectar when the taste of lifes holding me down
So hard to plant the seed of reform
To set my sights on defeating the storm
So I hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Oh yeah
Hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down whoo yeah
Hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me yeah
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Id love to see you
Id love to see you
Id love to see you
Id love to see you
