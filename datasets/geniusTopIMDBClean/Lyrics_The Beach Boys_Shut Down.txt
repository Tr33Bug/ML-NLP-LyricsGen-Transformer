Tach it up tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down
It happened on the strip where the road is wide
Oooo rev it up now 
Two cool shorts standing side by side
Oooo rev it up now 
Yeah my fuel injected Stingray and a fourthirteen
Oooo rev it up now 
Revving up our engines and it sounds real mean
Oooo rev it up now 
Tach it up tach it up
Buddy going to shut you down
Declining numbers at an even rate
Oooo moving out now 
At the count of one we both accelerate
Oooo moving out now 
My Stingray is light the slicks are starting to spin
Oooo moving out now 
But the fourthirteens really digging in
Oooo moving out now 
Got to be cool now power shift  here we go
Superstock Dodge is winding out in low
But my fuel injected Stingrays really starting to go
To get the traction Im riding the clutch
My pressure plates burning that machines too much
Pedals to the floor hear the dual quads drink
Oooo pump it up now 
And now the fourthirteens lead is starting to shrink
Oooo pump it up now 
Hes hot with ram induction but its understood
Oooo pump it up now 
I got a fuel injected engine sitting under my hood
Oooo pump it up now 


Shut it off shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off shut it off buddy now I shut you down
