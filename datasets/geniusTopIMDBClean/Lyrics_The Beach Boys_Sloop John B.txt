We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin all night
Got into a fight
Well I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John Bs sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home yeah yeah
Well I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captains trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why dont you leave me alone Yeah yeah
Well I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John Bs sail  Hoist up the John Bs sail 
See how the mainsail sets  See how the mainsail sets 
Call for the captain ashore let me go home
Let me go home I wanna go home
Let me go home  Hoist up the John Bs sail 
Hoist up the John B  Hoist up the John B 
I feel so broke up
I wanna go home let me go home
The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why dont they let me go home
This is the worst trip Ive ever been on


So hoist up the John Bs sail  Hoist up the John Bs sail 
See how the mainsail sets  See how the mainsail sets 
Call for the captain ashore let me go home
Let me go home I wanna go home
Let me go home
