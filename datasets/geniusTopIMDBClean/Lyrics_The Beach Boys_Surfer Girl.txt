Little surfer little one
Made my heart come all undone
Do you love me do you surfer girl
Surfer girl my little surfer girl
I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the oceans roar
Do you love me do you surfer girl
Surfer girl my little surfer girl
We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my woody I would take you
Everywhere I go
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
Do you love me do you surfer girl
Surfer girl my little surfer girl
Girl surfer girl my little surfer girl
Girl surfer girl my little surfer girl
Girl surfer girl my little surfer girl
