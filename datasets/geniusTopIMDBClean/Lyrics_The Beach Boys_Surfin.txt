Surfing is the only life
The only way for me
Now surf surf with me
Bom Bom Dit Di Dit Dip
I got up this morning turned on my radio
I was checking on the surfing scene
To see if I would go
And when the DJ tells me that the surfing is fine
Thats when I know my baby and I will have a good time
Were going surfing
Bom bom dip di dit   Surfing
From the early morning to the middle of the night
Any time the surf is up the time is right
And when the surf is down to take its place
Well do the Surfers Stomp its the latest dance craze
Now the dawn is breaking and we really got to go
But well be back here very soon that you better know
Yeah my surfer knots are rising and my board is losing wax
But that wont stop me baby cause you know Im coming back
Surfing is the only life the only way for me
Now come on pretty baby and surf with me
Bom bom dip di dit
Bom bom dip di dit
