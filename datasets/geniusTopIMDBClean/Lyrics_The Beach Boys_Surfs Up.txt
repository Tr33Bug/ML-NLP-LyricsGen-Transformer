A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along oh
To a handsome mannered baton
Bygone bygone 
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
Bygone bygone 
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping
Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
Bygone bygone 
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
Bygone bygone 
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping Brother John
Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
TwoStep to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised the fired rose
The fullness of the wine the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die
A choke of grief heart hardened I
Beyond belief a broken man too tough to cry
Surfs Up mmmm mmmm mmmm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A childrens song
Child child child child child
A child is the father of the man
Child child child child child
A child is the father of the man
A childrens song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
Thats why the child is the father to the man
Child child child child child
Child child child child child
Na na na na na na na na
Child child child child child
Thats why the child is the father to the man
Child child child child child
