I had to prove that I could make it alone now
But thats not me
I wanted to show how independent Id grown now
But thats not me
I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl
Im a little bit scared cause I havent been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time
My folks when I wrote them told em what I was up to
Said thats not me
I went through all kinds of changes took a look at myself
And said thats not me
I miss my pad and the places Ive known
And every night as I lay there alone
I would dream
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasnt so pretty
Im glad I went now Im that much more sure that were ready
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasnt so pretty
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasnt so pretty
