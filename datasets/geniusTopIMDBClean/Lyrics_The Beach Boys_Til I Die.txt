Im a cork on the ocean
Floating over the raging sea
How deep is the ocean
How deep is the ocean
I lost my way hey hey hey
Im a rock in a landslide
Rolling over the mountainside
How deep is the valley
How deep is the valley
It kills my soul hey hey hey
Im a leaf on a windy day
Pretty soon Ill be blown away
How long will the wind blow
How long will the wind blow
Dodo dodododododo dodo
Until I die  Until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
These things Ill be until I die
