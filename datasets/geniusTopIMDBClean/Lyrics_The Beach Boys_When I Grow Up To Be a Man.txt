When I Grow Up  To Be a Man  Lyrics
When I grow up to be a man
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadnt done what I did
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man
Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl
fourteen fifteen 
Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world
sixteen seventeen 
Now Im young and free but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square
eighteen nineteen 
When theyre out having fun yeah
Will I still want to have my share
twenty twentyone 
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life  rest of my life 
When I grow up to be a man
What will I be when I grow up to be a man


twentytwo twentythree 
Wont last forever
twentyfour twentyfive 
Its kind of sad
twentysix twentyseven 
Wont last forever
twentyeight twentynine 
Its kind of sad
thirty thirtyone 
Wont last forever
thirtytwo
