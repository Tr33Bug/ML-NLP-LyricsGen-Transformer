Wouldnt it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldnt have to wait so long
And wouldnt it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know its gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldnt it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
But happy times together weve been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Oh wouldnt it be nice
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Oh baby then there wouldnt be a single thing we couldnt do
Oh we could be married  Oh we could be married 
And then wed be happy  And then wed be happy 
Oh wouldnt it be nice
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
But wouldnt it be nice
Goodnight my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Goodnight my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Goodnight my baby
Sleep tight my baby
