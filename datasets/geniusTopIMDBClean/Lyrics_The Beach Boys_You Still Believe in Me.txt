I know perfectly well Im not where I should be
Ive been very aware youve been patient with me
Every time we break up you bring back your love to me
And after all Ive done to you how can it be
You still believe in me
I try hard to be more what you want me to be
But I cant help how I act when youre not here with me
I try hard to be strong but sometimes I fail myself
And after all Ive promised you so faithfully
You still believe in me
I wanna cry
Cry
Ah
Ah
Ah
