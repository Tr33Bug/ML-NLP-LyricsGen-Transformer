My daddy was a bank robber
But he never hurt nobody
He just loved to live that way
And he loved to steal your money
Some is rich and some is poor
Thats the way the world is
But I dont believe in lyin back
Sayin how bad your luck is
So we came to jazz it up
We never loved a shovel
Break your back to earn our pay
An dont forget to grovel
The old man spoke up in a bar
Said I never been in prison
A lifetime serving one machine
Is ten times worse than prison
Imagine if all the boys in jail
Could get out now together
Whaddya think theyd want to say to us
While we was bein clever
Someday youll meet your rockin chair
Cause thats where were spinnin
Theres no point to wanna comb your hair
When its grey and thinning
So we came to jazz it up
We never loved a shovel
Break your back to earn our pay
An dont forget to grovel
Hey
Get away get away get away get away get away get away get away
Run rabbit run
Strike out boys for the hills
I can find that hole in the wall
And I know that they never will
