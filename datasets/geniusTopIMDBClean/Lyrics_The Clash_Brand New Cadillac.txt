Drive
Drive
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
Yes she did
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
She said Hey come here Daddy
I aint never comin back
Baby baby wont you hear my plea
Cmon sugar just come on back to me
She said Balls to you Big Daddy
Baby baby wont you hear my plea
Oh cmon just hear my plea
She said Balls to you Daddy
She aint comin back to me
Baby baby drove up in a Cadillac
I said Jesus Christ Whered ya get that Cadillac
She said Balls to you Daddy
She aint never coming back
She aint never coming back
She aint never coming back
She aint never coming back
