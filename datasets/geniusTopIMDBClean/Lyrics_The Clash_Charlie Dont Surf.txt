Charlie dont surf and we think he should
Charlie dont surf and you know that it aint no good
Charlie dont surf for his hamburger Momma
Charlies going to be a napalm star
Everybody wants to rule the world
It must be something we get from birth
One truth is we never learn
Satellites will make space burn
Weve been told to keep the strangers out
We dont like them starting to hang around
We dont like them all over town
Across the world we are going to blow them down
Chorus 
Charlie dont surf and we think he should
Charlie dont surf and you know that it aint no good
Charlie dont surf for his hamburger Momma
Charlies going to be a napalm star
The reign of the super powers must be over
So many armies cant free the earth
Soon the rock will roll over
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola
Its a one a way street in a one horse town
One way people starting to brag around
You can laugh put them down
These one way people going to blow us down
Chorus 
Charlie dont surf and we think he should
Charlie dont surf and you know that it aint no good
Charlie dont surf for his hamburger Momma
Charlies going to be a napalm star
Charlie dont surf hell never learn
Charlie dont surf though hes got a gun
Charlie dont surf think that he should
Charlie dont surf we really think that he should
Charlie dont surf
