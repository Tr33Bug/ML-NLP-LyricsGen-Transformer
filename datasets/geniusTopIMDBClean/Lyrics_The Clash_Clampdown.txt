The kingdom is ransacked
The jewels all taken back
And the chopper descends
Theyre hidden in the back
With a message on a halfbaked tape
And the spool goes round
Sayin Im back here in this place
And I could cry
And theres smoke you could click on 
Awhat are we gonna do now
Takin off his turban they said Is this man a Jew
Workin for the clampdown
They put up a poster sayin We earn more than you
Were workin for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blueeyed men
To be young believers
The judge said Five to ten but I say Double that again
Im not  workin for the clampdown 
No man born with a livin soul
Can be  workin for the clampdown 
Kick over the wall cause governments to fall
How can you refuse it
Let fury have the hour anger can be power
Dyou know that you can use it
The voices in your head are callin
Stop wasting your time theres nothing comin
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You dont owe nothin boy get running
Its the best years of your life they want to steal


But you grow up and you calm down
And youre  workin for the clampdown 
You start wearin blue and brown
And  workin for the clampdown 
So you got someone to boss around
It makes ya feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
Make your first kill now
In these days of evil presidentes
Workin for the clampdown 
But lately one or two has fully paid their dues
For  workin for the clampdown 
Ha Get along Get along
Workin for the clampdown 
Ha Get along Get along
Workin for the clampdown 
Yeah Im workin hard in Harrisburg
Workin hard in Petersburg
Workin for the clampdown 
Workin for the clampdown 
Ha Get along Get along
Beggin to be melted down
Get along get along 
Work
Work
And I aint giving away no secrets  ha
Work
More work
More work
Work
Work
Work
Work
Whos barmy now
