But we didnt want it on the label
They said Fly to Amsterdam
The people laughed but the press went mad
Oh someones really smart
Oh complete control yeah thats a laugh
On the last tour my mates they couldnt get in
Id open up the back door but theyd get run out again
And at every hotel we was amet by the law
Come for the party come to make sure
Oh have we done something wrong
Oh complete control even over this song

They said wed be artistically free
When we signed that bit of paper
