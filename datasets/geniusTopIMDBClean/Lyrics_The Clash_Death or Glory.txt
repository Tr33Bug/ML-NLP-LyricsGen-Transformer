Hey
Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
And ends up makin payments on a sofa or a girl
Love and hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around cause they dont understand how
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
In every gimmick hungry yob diggin gold from rock n roll
Grabs the mic and tell us hell die before hes sold
But I believe in this and its been tested by research
He who fucks nuns will later join the church
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
Fear in the gun sights
They say Lie low
You say Ok
Dont wanna play a show
No other thinking
Was it death or glory now
Playin the blues of kings
Sure looks better now
Death or glory just another story
Death or glory just another story
In every dingy basement on every dingy street
Every draggin handclap over every draggin beat
Thats just the beat of time beat that must go on
If youve been tryin for years we already heard your song


Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory just another story
Gotta march a long way
Fight a long time
Get to travel over mountains
Got to travel over seas
We gonna fight you brother
We gonna fight til you lose
We gonna raise trouble
We gonna raise hell
We gonna fight you brother
Raise hell
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story
