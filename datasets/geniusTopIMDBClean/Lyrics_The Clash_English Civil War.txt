When Johnny comes marchin home again hurrah tala
Hes comin by bus or underground hurrah tala
A womans eye will shed a tear
To see his face so beaten in fear
And it was just around the corner in the English Civil War
It was still at the stage of clubs and fists hurrah tala
When that well known face got beaten to bits hurrah tala
Your face was blue in the light of the screen
As watched the speech of an animal scream
New Party army was marchin right over our heads
All right
Ha ha I told you so hurrah tala
Says everybody that we know hurrah tala
But who hid a radio under the stairs
Who got caught out unawares
New Party army came marchin right up the stairs
When Johnny comes marchin home again hurrah tala
Nobody understands it can happen again hurrah tala
The sun is shinin and the kids are shoutin loud
Ya got to know its shinin through a crack in the cloud
And the shadows keep on fallin when Johnny comes marchin home
Hurrah Johnny
Oh yeah Johnny
All the girls go oh
Get his coffin ready
Cause Johnny is comin home
