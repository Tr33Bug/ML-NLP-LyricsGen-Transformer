One two a one two three four
Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sun
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue
They told no one where they had begun
Four horsemen
They were given all the foods of vanity
And all the instant promises of immortality
But they bit the dust screamin Insanity
Four horsemen
One was over the edge one was over the cliff
One was lickin em dry with a bloody great spliff
When they picked up the hiker didnt want the lift
From the horsemen
But you youre not searching are you now
Youre not lookin anyhow
Youre never gonna ride that lonely mile
Or put yourself up on trial
Oh you told me how your life was so bad
And I agree that it does seem sad
But thats the price that you gotta pay
For lazin all around all day
Four horsemen an they comin right through
Four horsemen and theyre pissing by you
They make you look like youre wearing a truss
Four horsemen and its gonna be us
Well they gave us everything for bendin the mind
And we cleaned out their pockets and we drank em blind
Its a long way to the finish so dont get left behind
By those horsemen


And they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sun
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue
But we still told nothing bout what was to come
Four horsemen
We play all your rock and roll
We know your rockin soul
We reach the parts other combos cannot reach
We reach the beaches other armies cannot reach
Weve reached the top of the mountain they cannot reach
We play all your rock and roll
We know your rockin soul
We play your rock and roll
We know your rockin soul
