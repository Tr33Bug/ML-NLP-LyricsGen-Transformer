Starved in metropolis
Hooked on necropolis
Addict of metropolis
Do the worm on the acropolis
Slamdance the cosmopolis
Enlighten the populace
Hungry darkness of living
Who will thirst in the pit
Hooked in necropolis 
She spent a lifetime deciding
How to run from it
Addicts of metropolis 
Once fate had a witness
And the years seemed like friends
Girlfriends 
Now her child has a dream
But it begins like it ends
Shot into eternity
Methadone kitty
Iron serenity
Ghetto defendant
It is heroin pity
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
Strung out committee 
Walled out of the city
Clubbed down from uptown
Sprayed pest from the nest
Run out to barrio town
The guards are itchy 
Forced to watch at the feast
Then sweep up the night
Flipped pieces of coin
Broken bottles 
Exchanged for birthright
Ghetto defendant it is heroin pity
Strung out committee 
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
Not sitting pretty 
Grafted in a jiffy 
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city

The ghetto prince of gutter poets
Was bounced out of the room
Jean Arthur Rimbaud 
By the bodyguards of greed
For disturbing the tomb
1873 
His words like flamethrowers
Paris commune 
Burnt the ghettos in their chests
His face was painted whiter
And he was laid to rest
Died in Marseille 
Ghetto defendant it is heroin pity
Buried in Charleville 
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
Shut up in eternity 
Guatemala
Honduras
Poland
100 years war
TV rerun invasion
Death squad Salvador
Afghanistan
Meditation
Old Chinese flu
Kick junk
What else
Can a poor worker do
