Hate and war
The only things we got today
And if I close my eyes
It will not go away
You have to deal with it
It is the currency
Hate hate hate hate hate hate
The hate of a nation
A million miles from home
And get war from the junkies
Who dont like my form
Im gonna stay in the city
Even when the house fall down
I dont dream of a holiday
When hate and war come around
Hate and war
The only thing we got today
Hate and war
The only thing
I have no will to survive
I cheat if I cant win
If someone locks me out
I kick my way back in
And if I get aggression
I give it two time back
Every day its just the same
With hate and war on my back
Hate and war  I hate English men 
Hate and war  Just as bad as wops 
Hate and war  I hate all the politeness 
Hate and war  I hate all the cops 
Hate and war  I want to walk down any street 
Hate and war  Dressed like a creep 
Hate and war  I dont care if I get beat up 
Hate and war  By any rotten Greek
