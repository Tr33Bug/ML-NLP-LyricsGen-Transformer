Well I got a friend whos a man  whos a man 
What man The man who keeps me from the lonely
The only
He gives me what I need  what you need 
What you got I need it all so badly
Oh anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it but not for free
Its hateful
And its paid for
And Im so grateful to be nowhere
This year Ive lost some friends  some friends 
What friends I dunno I didnt even notice
You see I gotta go out again  again 
My friend I gotta see that main man
Hey
Oh anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it but not for free
Its hateful
And its paid for
And Im so grateful to be nowhere
Oh anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it but not for free
Its hateful
And its paid for
And Im so grateful to be nowhere
I killed all my nerves  my nerves 
What swerves I cant drive so steady
And already
Ive lost my memory  my mind 
Behind I cant see so clearly
Oh anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it but not for free
Oh anything I want he gives it to me  Anything I want 
Anything I want he gives it but not for free  Anything I want 
Anything I want anything I want
