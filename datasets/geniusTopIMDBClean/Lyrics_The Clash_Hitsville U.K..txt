Hitsville UK LyricsThey cried the tears they shed the fears
Up and down the land
They stole guitars or used guitars
So the tape would understand
Without even the slightest hope of a thousand sales
Just as if as if there was Hitsville in UK
I know the boy was all alone til the Hitsville hit UK
Remember 
They say true talent will always emerge in time
When lightning hits Small Wonder
Its Fast Rough Factory time
No expense accounts or lunch discounts
Or hyping up the charts
The band went in and knocked em dead in 2 minutes 59
I know the boy was all alone til the Hitsville hit UK
So   hit it
No slimy deals with smarmy eels in Hitsville UK
Lets shaken say well operate in Hitsville UK
I know the girl felt all alone til the Hitsville hit UK
The mutants creeps and musclemen
Are shakin like a leaf
It blows a hole in the radio
When it hasnt sounded good all week
A mike n boom in your livin room in Hitsville UK
No consumer trials nor AOR in Hitsville UK
I know the boy felt all alone til the Hitsville hit UK
Now the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK
I know the boys and girls are not alone
Now that Hitsville hit UK
