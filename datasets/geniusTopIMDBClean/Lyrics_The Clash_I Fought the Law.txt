Breakin rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I needed money cause I had none
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I left my baby and it feels so bad
I guess my race is run
Shes the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda
Robbin people with a sixgun
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I lost my girl and I lost my fun
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I left my baby and it feels so bad
I guess my race is run
Shes the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda the law won
I fought the law anda
