If its true a rich man leads a sad life
Thats what they say from day to day
Then what do all the poor do with their lives
On judgment day when nothin is saved
Ive been beat up Ive been thrown out
But Im not down no Im not down
Ive been shown up but Ive grown up
And Im not down no Im not down
On my own I faced a gang of jeering
In strange streets oh
When my nerves were pumping and I fought my fear in
I didnt run I was not done
Ive been beat up Ive been thrown out
But Im not down no Im not down
Ive been shown up but Ive grown up
And Im not down no Im not down
Cause Ive lived that kind of day
When none of your sorrows will go away
It goes down and down and hit the floor
Down and down and down some more
Depression
But I know therell be some way
When I can swing everything back my way
Like skyscrapers rising up
Floor by floor not giving up
So you rock around and think that youre the toughest
In the world the whole wide world
But youre streets away from where it gets the roughest
You aint been there
Ive been beat up Ive been thrown out
But Im not down no Im not down
Ive been shown up but Ive grown up
And Im not down no Im not down
Im not down
No Im not down
No Im not down
No Im not down
No Im not down
No Im not down
No Im not down
Im not down
