Im So Bored with the USA Lyrics
Yankee soldier
He wanna shoot some skag
He met it in Cambodia
But now he cant afford a bag
Yankee dollar talk
To the dictator of the world
In fact its giving orders
And they cant afford to miss a word
Im so bored with the USA
Im so bored with the USA
But what can I do
Yankee detectives
Are always on the TV
Because killers in America
Work seven days a week
Never mind the stars and stripes
Lets play the Watergate Tapes
Ill salute the New Wave
And I hope nobody escapes
Im so bored with the USA
Im so bored with the USA
But what can I do
Im so bored with the USA
Im so bored with the USA
But what can I do
Im so bored with the USA
Im so bored with the USA
Im so bored with the USA
But what can I do


Move up Starsky
For the CIA
Suck on Kojak
For the USA
