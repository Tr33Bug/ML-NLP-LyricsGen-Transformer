This is a public service announcement with guitar
Know your rights
All three of em
Number one
You have the right not to be killed
Murder is a crime
Unless it was done
By a Policeman
Or an aristocrat
Oh know your rights
And Number two
You have the right to food money
Providing of course you
Dont mind a little
Investigation humiliation
And if you cross your fingers
Rehabilitation
Know your rights
These are your rights
Hey say Wang
Oh know these rights
Number three
You have the right to free speech
As long as youre not
Dumb enough to actually try it


Know your rights
These are your rights
Oh know your rights
These are your rights
All three of em ha
And it has been suggested
In some quarters that this is not enough
Well get off the streets
Get off the streets
