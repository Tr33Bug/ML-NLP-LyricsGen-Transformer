Elevator Goin up
In the gleamin corridor of the 51st floor
The money can be made if you really want some more
Executive decision at clinical precision
Jumping from the windows filled with indecision
I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice party girl
Coke adds life where there isnt any
So freeze man freeze
Its the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You dont need a launderette you can take em to the vet
I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice party girl
Coke adds life where there isnt any
So freeze man freeze
CocaCola advertising and cocaine
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain
Neon light sign says it
I read it in the paper theyre crazy
Yeah suit your life maybe so
In the White House I know
All over Berlin they do it for years
And in Manhattan
Comin through the door is a snub nose forty four
The barrel cant snort it can spatter on the floor
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs
And your tongue feels like a fish
Youre leapin from the windows sayin
Dont give me none of this
Coke adds life advertising world
Treat me nice party girl
Coke adds life where there isnt any
So freeze man freeze
Hit the deck
