London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come outta the cupboard ya boys and girls
London calling now dont look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling see we aint got no swing
Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing
The ice age is coming the suns zoomin in
Meltdown expected the wheat is growin thin
Engines stop running but I have no fear
Cause London is drownin I live by the river
London calling  to the imitation zone
Forget it brother you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holdin out and draw another breath
London calling and I dont want to shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin out
London calling see we aint got no Hyde
Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes
The ice age is coming the suns zoomin in
Engines stop running the wheat is growin thin
A nuclear error but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning I I live by the river
The ice age is coming the suns zoomin in
Engines stop running the wheat is growin thin
A nuclear error but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning I I live by the river
Now get this
London calling  yes I was there too
And ya know what they said Well some of it was true
London calling  at the top of the dial
And after all this wont you give me a smile
London calling 
I never felt so much alike alike alike
