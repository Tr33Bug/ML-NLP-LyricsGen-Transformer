Londons burning
Londons burning
All across the town all across the night
Everybodys drivin with full headlights
Black or white you turn it on you face the new religion
Everybodys sittin round watching television
Londons burning  With boredom now 
Londons burning  Dial 99999 
Londons burning  With boredom now 
Londons burning  Dial 99999 
Im up and down the Westway in and out the lights
What a great traffic system its so bright
I cant think of a better way to spend the night
Than speedin around underneath the yellow lights
Londons burning  With boredom now 
Londons burning  Dial 99999 
Londons burning  With boredom now 
Londons burning  Dial 99999 
Now Im in the subway and Im lookin for the flat
This one leads to this block this one leads to that
The wind howls through the empty blocks looking for a home
I run through the empty stone because Im all alone
Londons burning  With boredom now 
Londons burning  Dial 99999 
Londons burning  With boredom now 
Londons burning  Dial 99999 
Here we go
Yeah here we are riding along the West London motorway
On your left we see the tower blocks built in 1963
With a massive repair bill for the GLC
And over there you see Westbourne Park
They dont want a traffic system to park the car
Londons burning
