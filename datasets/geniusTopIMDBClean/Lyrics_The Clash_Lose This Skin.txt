Come with me I wont hide
Were going on a ride
We meet each day use time to see
While were young and almost free
Ive got to lose this skin Im imprisoned in  x2 
Do not turn or hate to see
All the things you think weve got
Do not turn or hate to see
What happened to the wife of Lot
Ive got to lose this skin Im imprisoned in  x2 
Were alone or so they say
Were not on our own in that way
When were alone its real tough going
We can take a part in someone elses play
Come with me I thought he said
But thats not him anymore hes dead
Whats it like to be so free
So free it looks like lost to me
Ive got to lose this skin Im imprisoned in  x2
