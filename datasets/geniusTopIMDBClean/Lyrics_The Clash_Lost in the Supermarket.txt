Im all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
I wasnt born so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see
I heard the people who live on the ceiling
Scream and fight most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feelin
Thats how its been all around me
Im all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
Im all tuned in I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
Ive got my giant hit discotheque album
I empty a bottle I feel a bit free
The kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely
Im all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
And its not here
It disappeared
Im all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality
Im all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer

Im all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
