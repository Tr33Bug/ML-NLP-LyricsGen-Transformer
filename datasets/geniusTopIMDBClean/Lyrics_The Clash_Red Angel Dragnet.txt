I come from a long way away
And I know a fine thing when I see it
See it
For the same reason no one ever
Pointed a telescope at the sun
Talking about the Red Angels of NY City
Who shot the shot
Who got shot tonight
Who shot the shot
Who got shot tonight
Not even five enforcement agencies can save their own
Never mind the people
Tonight its raining on the Angels of the City
Did anyone prophesize these people
Only Travis
Come in Travis
All the animals come out at night
Queens fairies dopers junkies sick venal
Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets
Thank god for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk
Listen you screwheads
Here is a man who would not take it anymore
A man who stood up against the scum the filth
Now I see clearly
Personally I know the alley
Where Jack feeds on the birds of night
Not even bubbies bicycling 2x2
Can stop the blood and feathers flying
Wearing overalls and for once and for all
What is the dream
Ill tell it
To live like they do in the movies
San Juan you listening
Yeah I bet you are
Hands up for Hollywood
Hooray 
I hear you
Snappy on the air
Hang in there
Wall to wall
You saved the world
What else You saved the girl
Champagne on ice
No stranger to Alcatraz
To boot
Or strip it down
Chop it a little
Being reasonable
Just freedom to move
To live
For women to take a walk in the park at midnight
Hey but this is serious
She cant even get back home
Who shot the shot
