Who needs remote control
From the Civic Hall
Push a button
Activate
You gotta work
Youre late
Its so grey in London town
Panda car crawlin around
Here it comes
Eleven oclock
Where can we go now
Cant make no noise
Cant get no gear
Cant make no money
Cant get outta here
Big business it dont like you
Dont like the things you do
They got no money
They got no power
They think youre useless
And so you are punk
They had a meeting in Mayfair
They got you down and they wanna keep you there
It makes them worried
Their bank accounts
Thats all that matters
You dont count
Cant make no progress
Cant get ahead
Cant stop the regress
Dont wanna be dead
Look out those rules and regulations 
Who needs the Parliament
Sittin makin laws all day
Theyre all fat and old
Queuein for the House of Lords
Repression  Gonna start on Tuesday 
Repression  Gonna be a Dalek 
Repression  I am a robot 
Repression  I obey
