Revolution rock
It is a brand new rock
A bad bad rock
This here revolution rock
Careful how you move Mac you dig me in me back
And Im so pilled up that I rattle
I have got the sharpest knife so I cut the biggest slice
I got no time to do battle
Hey everybody smash up your seats
And rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma tell your pa
Everythings gonna be all right
Cant you feel it Dont ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock
I am in a state of shock
So bad bad rock
This here revolution rock
Careful how you slide Clyde
All you did was glide
And you poured your beer in me hat
Keep my good eye on the beat
Living on fixation street
I aint got no time for that
Everybody smash up your seats
And rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mama tell your pa
Everythings gonna be all right
Cant you feel it Dont ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock
Yeah so get that cheese grater going
Against the grains
Wearin me down
Pressure increase

Everybody smash up your seats
And rock to this brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mama tell your father
Everythings gonna be all right
Cant you feel it Dont ignore it
Gonna be alright
Revolution rock
To the coolest mobsters in Kingstown
With the hardest skies
And the cruelest songs
Is your heart so made of rock
That the blood must run round the block
Are you listenin mobsters
Yeah
All people crawl gotta die
While cart of food goes rolling by
Its food for thought mobsters
Young people shoot their days away
Ive seen talent thrown away
On your loan shark
The organ play
And theyre dancin to the brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your mamamama tell your papapapa
Everythings gonna be all right
Cant you feel it Dont ignore it
Everything is gonna be alright
I said revolution rock
This old cheese grater
Runnin me down
This must be the way out
Heres a cheap bit

And Bongo Jazz a specialty
