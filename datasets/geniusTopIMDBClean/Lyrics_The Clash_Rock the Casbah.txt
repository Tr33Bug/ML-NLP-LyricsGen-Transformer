Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top
The Sheikh he drove his Cadillac
He went a cruisin down the ville
The Muezzin was astanding
On the radiator grille
Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Cleared the square
They began to wail
Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
Now over at the temple
Oh They really pack em in
The in crowd say its cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive


Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
The king called up his jet fighters
He said You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way
As soon as the Shareef was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Shareef was
Out of their hair
The jet pilots wailed
Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
Shareef dont like it
Rockin the Casbah rock the Casbah
Shareef dont like it 
Thinks its not kosher
Rockin the Casbah
Rock the Casbah 
Shareef dont like it 
Fundamentally cant take it
Rockin the Casbah
Rock the Casbah 
Shareef dont like it 
You know he really hates it
Rockin the Casbah
Rock the Casbah 
Shareef dont like it 
Really really hates it
