Now sing Michael sing
On the route of the 19 Bus
We hear them sayin
How you get so rude anda reckless
Dont you be so crude anda feckless
You been drinkin brew for breakfast
Rudie cant fail no no
We reply 
I know that my life makes you nervous
But I tell you that I cant live in service
Like the doctor whos born for a purpose
Rudie cant fail
Ok 
I went to the market to realize  my soul 
What I need  I just dont have   Oh no 
First they curse then they press me til I hurt
He say  Rudie cant fail
First you must cure your temper
Then find a job in a paper
You need someone for a saviour
Rudie cant fail
We reply 
Now we get arude and areckless
To been seen looking cool and speckless
An drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie cant fail  oh no no 
I went to the market to realize  my soul 
Cause what I need  I just dont have   Have 
First they curse then they press me til I hurt
Rudie cant fail
