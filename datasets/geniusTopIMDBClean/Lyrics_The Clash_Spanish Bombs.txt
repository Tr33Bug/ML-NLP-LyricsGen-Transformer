Spanish songs in Andaluca
The shooting site in the days of 39
Oh please leave the ventana open
Federico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
Im flyin in on a DC 10 tonight
Spanish bombs yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazn
Spanish bombs yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazn
Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag they wore the black one
After they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My seoritas rose was nipped in the bud
Spanish bombs yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazn
Spanish bombs yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazn
The hillsides ring with Free the people
Or can I hear the echo from the days of 39
With trenches full of poets the ragged army
Fixin bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
Im hearin music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
Im flyin in on a DC 10 tonight
Spanish bombs yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazn
Spanish bombs yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda oh mi corazn
Oh mi corazn
Oh mi corazn
Spanish songs in Andaluca
Mandolina oh mi corazn
Spanish songs in Granada
Oh mi corazn
Oh mi corazn
Oh mi corazn
Oh mi corazn
