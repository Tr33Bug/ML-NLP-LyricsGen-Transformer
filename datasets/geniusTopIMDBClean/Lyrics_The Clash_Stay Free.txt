We met when we were at school
Never took no shit from no one we werent fools
The teacher says were dumb were only havin fun
You know we piss on everyone in the classroom
When we got thrown out I left without much fuss
And weekends wed go dancin down Streatham on the bus
You always made me laugh got me in bad fights
Play me pool all night smokin menthols
I practiced daily in my room
You were down the Crown plannin your next move
Go on a nickin spree hit the wrong guy
Each of you get three years in Brixton
I did my very best to write
How was Butlins Were the screws too tight
When you lot get out were gonna hit the town
Well burn it fucking down to a cinder
Cause years have passed and things have changed
And I move anyway I want to go
And Ill never forget the feelin I got
When I heard that youd got home
And Ill never forget the smile on my face
Cause I knew where you would be
And if youre in the Crown tonight have a drink on me
But go easy
Step lightly yeah
Stay free
