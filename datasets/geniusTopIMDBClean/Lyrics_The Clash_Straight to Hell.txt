If you can play on fiddle
Hows about a British jig and reel
Speaking Kings English in quotation
As railhead towns feel the steel mills rust
Water froze in the generation
Clear as winter ice
This is your paradise
There aint no need for ya
There aint no need for ya
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Wanna join in a chorus
Of the Amerasian blues
When its Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa papasan take me home
See me got photo photo
Photograph of you
And Mamma Mamma Mammasan
Of you and Mamma Mamma Mammasan
Let me tell you bout your blood bamboo kid
It aint CocaCola its rice
Straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Oh Papasan
Please take me home
Oh Papasan
Everybody they wanna go home
So Mammasan says
You wanna play mindcrazed banjo
On the druggydrag ragtime USA
In Parkland International
Ha Junkiedom USA
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says
Hahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhahhah
Straight to hell
Can you cough it up loud and strong
The immigrants
They wanna sing all night long
It could be anywhere
Most likely could be any frontier
Any hemisphere
No mans land
There aint no asylum here
King Solomon he never lived round here
Straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Oh Pappasan please take me home
Everybody they wanna go home now
