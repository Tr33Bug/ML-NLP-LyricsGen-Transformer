Theres a solitary man cryin Hold me
Its only because hes alonely
And if the keeper of time runs slowly
He wont be alive for long
If he only had time to tell of all of the things he planned
With a card up his sleeve what would he achieve
It means nothin
To the opium dens and the barroom gin
In the Belmont chair playing violin
The gamblers face cracks into a grin
As he lays down the king of spades
But the dealer just stares
Theres something wrong here he thinks
The gambler is seized and forced to his knees
And shot dead
He only wanted more time
Away from the darkest door
But his luck it gave in
As the dawn light crept in
And he lay on the floor
From the Hundred Year War to the Crimea
With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear
To all of the men who have stood with no fear
In the service of the King
Before you met your fate
Be sure you did not forsake
Your lover
May not be around anymore
Theres a solitary man cryin Hold me
Its only because hes alonely
And if the keeper of time runs slowly
He wont be alive for long
