The Magnificent Seven
Ring Ring Its 700 AM
Move yourself to go again
Cold water in the face
Brings you back to this awful place
Knuckle merchants and you bankers too
Must get up and learn those rules
Weather man and the crazy chief
One says Sun and one says Sleet
AM the FM the PM too
Churnin out that boogaloo
Gets you up and agets you out
But how long can you keep it up
Gimme Honda gimme Sony
So cheap and real phony
Hong Kong dollar Indian cents
English pounds and Eskimo pence
You lot What
Dont stop give it all you got
You lot What
Dont stop yeah
You lot What
Dont stop give it all you got
You lot What
Dont stop yeah
Workin for a rise better my station
Take my baby to Sophistication
Shes seen the ads she thinks its nice
Better work hard I seen the price
Never mind that its time for the bus
We got to work and youre one of us
Clocks go slow in a place of work
Minutes drag and the hours jerk
Yeah wave byebye
When can I tell em wot I do
In a second maaan aright Chuck
Wave bubbubbubbye to the boss
Its our profit its his loss
But anyway the lunch bell ring
Take one hour and do your thang
Cheeseboiger
What do we have for entertainment
Cops kickin gypsies on the pavement
Now the news asnap to attention
The lunar landing of the dentist convention
Italian mobster shoots a lobster
Seafood restaurant gets outta hand
A car in the fridge a fridge in the car
Like cowboys do in TV land
You lot What
Dont stop give it all you got
You lot What
Dont stop oh
You lot What
Dont stop give it all you got yeah
You lot What
Dont stop
So get back to work and sweat some more
The sun will sink and well get out the door
Its no good for man to work in cages
Hits the town he drinks his wages
Youre frettin youre sweatin
But did you notice you aint gettin
Youre frettin youre sweatin
But did you notice not gettin anywhere
Dont you ever stop along enough to start
Take your car outta that gear
Dont you ever stop long enough to start
Get your car outta that gear
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
Came to the checkout at the 711
Marx was skint but he had sense
Engels lent him the necessary pence
What have we got Yeah
Awhat have we got Yeaho
What have we got Magnificence  I say 
What have we got
Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi
Went to the park to check on the game
But they was murdered by the other team
Who went on to win 15nil
You cant be true you cant be false
Youll be given the same reward
Socrates and Milhous Nixon
Both went the same way through the kitchen
Plato the Greek or Rin Tin Tin
Whos more famous to the billion millions
