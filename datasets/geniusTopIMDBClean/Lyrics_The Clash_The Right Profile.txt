Say where did I see this guy
In Red River
Or A Place in the Sun
Maybe The Misfits
Or From Here to Eternity
And everybody say Is he all right
And everybody say Whats he like
And everybody say He sure look funny
Thats Montgomery Clift honey
New York  New York  New York 42nd Street
Hustlers rustle and pimp pimp the beat
Monty Clift is recognized at dawn
He aint got no shoes and his clothes are torn
And everybody say Is he all right
And everybody say Whats he like
Everybody say He sure look funny
Thats just Montgomery Clift honey
I see a car smashed at night
Cut the applause and dim the light
Montys face is broken on a wheel
Is he alive Can he still feel
And everybody say Is he all right
And everybody say Shine the light
Everybody say Its not funny
Thats Montgomery Clift honey
Shoot his right profile
Everybody say Is he all right
And everybody say Whats he like
Everybody say He sure look funny
Thats Montgomery Clift honey
Nembutal
Numbs it all
But I prefer
Alcohol
And everybody say Whats he like
And everybody say Is he all right
Everybody say He sure look funny
Thats Montgomery Clift honey
He said Go out and get me my old movie stills
Go out and get me another roll of pills
Everythings shakin but I aint got the chills
And everybody say Whats he like
And everybody say Is he all right
Everybody say He sure look funny
I was trapped Montgomery Clift honey
