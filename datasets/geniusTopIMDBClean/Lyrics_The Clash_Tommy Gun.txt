Tommy gun
You aint happy less you got one
Tommy gun
Aint gonna shoot the place up
Just for fun
Maybe he want to die for the money
Maybe he wants to kill for his country
Whatever he wants hes gonna get it
Tommy gun
You better strip it down for a customs run
Tommy gun
Waitin at the airport til kingdom come
An we can watch him make it on the nine oclock news
Standin there in Palestine lightin the fuse
Whatever you want youre gonna get it
Tommy gun
Tommy gun
Tommy gun
Ayoull be dead when  war is won
Tommy gun
But did you have to gun down everyone
I can see its kill or be killed
A nation of destiny has gotta be fulfilled
Whatever you want youre gonna get it
Tommy gun
Ayou can be a hero in an age of none
Tommy gun
Im cuttin out your picture from page one
Im gonna get a jacket just like yours
An give my false support to your cause
Whatever you want youre gonna get it
Alright
Okay so lets agree about the price
And make it one jet airliner for ten prisoners
Boats an tanks and planes its your game
Kings an queens an generals learn your name
I see all the innocent the human sacrifice
And if death comes so cheap
Then the same goes for life
