You say you stand by your man
So tell me something I dont understand
You said you love me and thats a fact
And then you left me said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But the heartaches in me til this day
You didnt stand by me
No not at all
You didnt stand by me
No way
All the times when we were close
Ill remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumblin down
I cant be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And theres only one thing I can say
You didnt stand by me
No not at all
You didnt stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Now I got a job but it dont pay
I need new clothes I need somewhere to stay
But without all of these things I can do
But without your love I wont make it through
But you dont understand my point of view
I suppose theres nothing I can do


You didnt stand by me
No not at all
You didnt stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
Did you stand by me
No not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
