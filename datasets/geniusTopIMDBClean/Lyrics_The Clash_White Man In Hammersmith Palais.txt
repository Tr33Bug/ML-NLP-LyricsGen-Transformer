White Man  In Hammersmith Palais Lyrics
12 a1 234
Ooh
Midnight to six man
For the first time from Jamaica
Dillinger and aLeroy Smart
Delroy Wilson your cool operator
Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae
With backin bands sound systems
If they got anything to say
Theres many black ears here to listen
But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right
Charging from the bass knives to the treble
But onstage they aint got no roots rock rebel
Onstage they aint got noroots rock rebel
Dress back jump back this is a bluebeat attack 
Cause it wont get you anywhere
Foolin with the guns
The British Army is waitin out there
An it weighs fifteen hundred tons
White youth black youth
Better find another solution
Why not phone up aRobin Hood
And ask him for some wealth distribution
Punk rocker in the UK
They wont notice anyway
Theyre all too busy fightin
For a good place under the lightin


The new groups are not concerned
With what there is to be learned
They got Burton suits huh ya think its funny
Turnin rebellion into money
All over people changin their votes
Along with their overcoats
If Adolf Hitler flew in today
Theyd send a limousine anyway
Im the allnight drugprowling wolf
Who looks so sick in the sun
Im the white man in the Palais
Just alookin for fun
Only lookin for fun
Oh please mister
Just leave me alone
Im only
Lookin for fun
