One two three four
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
Black man got a lotta problems
But they dont mind throwin a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be thick
And everybodys doin
Just what theyre told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
All the powers in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it
And everybodys doin
Just what theyre told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own


Hey you standing in line
Are we gonna sign an agreement
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
White riot I wanna riot
White riot a riot of my own
