Alabama Song  Whisky Bar  Lyrics
Well show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh dont ask why
Oh dont ask why
Show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh dont ask why
Oh dont ask why
For if we dont find
The next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
Weve lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey oh you know why
Oh moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
Weve lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey oh you know why
Yeah
Well show me the way to the next little girl
Oh dont ask why
Oh dont ask why
Show me the way to the next little girl
Oh dont ask why
Oh dont ask why
For if we dont find
The next little girl
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you I tell you
I tell you we must die
Oh moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
Weve lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey oh you know why
