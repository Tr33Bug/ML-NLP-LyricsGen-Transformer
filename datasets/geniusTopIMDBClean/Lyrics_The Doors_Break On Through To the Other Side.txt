Break On Through  To the Other Side  Lyrics
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run tried to hide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side yeah
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
Acan you still recall time we cried
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Hey
Come on yeah
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get high
She get high
She get high
She get high yeah
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chained us eyes that lied
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through ow
Aw yeah


Made the scene week to week
Day to day hour to hour
Gate is straight deep and wide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through break on through
Break on through break on through
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah
