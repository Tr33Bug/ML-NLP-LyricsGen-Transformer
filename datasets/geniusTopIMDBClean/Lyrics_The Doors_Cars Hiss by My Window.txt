The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
The cars hiss by my window
Like the waves down on the beach
I got this girl beside me
But shes out of reach
Headlight through my window
Shinin on the wall
Headlight through my window
Shinin on the wall
Cant hear my baby
Though I called and called
Windows started tremblin
With a sonic boom
Windows started tremblin
With a sonic boom boom
A cold girlll kill you
In a darkened room
