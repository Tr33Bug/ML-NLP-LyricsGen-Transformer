Yeah cmon
I love my girl
She lookin good
Cmon
One more
Five to one baby
One in five
No one here gets out alive now
You get yours baby
Ill get mine
Gonna make it baby
If we try
The old get old
And the young get stronger
May take a week
And it may take longer
They got the guns
But we got the numbers
Gonna win yeah
Were takin over
Come on
Your ballroom days are over baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening
Crawl across the years
Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful of dimes
Gonna make it baby in our prime
Come together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together aha
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together got to get together
Ooaaaaaah
Hey cmon honey
You wont have a long wait for me baby
Ill be there in just a little while
You see I gotta go out in this car with these people and
Get together one more time
Get together one more time
Get together got to
Get together got to
Get together got to
Take you up in my room and
Hahhahhahhahhah
Love my girl
She looking good looking real good
Love you come on
