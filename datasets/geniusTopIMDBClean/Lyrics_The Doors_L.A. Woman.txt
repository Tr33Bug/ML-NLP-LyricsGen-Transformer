LA Woman Lyrics
Well I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows
Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light
Or just another lost angel
City of Night City of Night
City of Night City of Night
LA woman LA woman
LA woman Sunday afternoon
LA woman Sunday afternoon
LA woman Sunday afternoon
Drive through your suburbs
Into your blues into your blues yeah
Into your blues into your blues
I see your hair is burning
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you
You know they are a liar
Driving down your freeways
Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars the topless bars
Never saw a woman so alone
So alone so alone so alone
Motel money murdermadness
Lets change the mood from glad to sadness
Mr Mojo Risin Mr Mojo Risin
Mr Mojo Risin Mr Mojo Risin
Got to keep on risin
Mr Mojo Risin Mr Mojo Risin
Mojo Risin gotta Mojo Risin
Mr Mojo Risin gotta keep on risin
Risin risin
Gone risin risin
Im gone risin risin
I gotta risin risin
Well risin risin
I gotta wooo yeah risin
Whoa oh yeah
Well I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows
Are you a lucky little lady in The City of Lights
Or just another lost angel
City of Night City of Night
City of Night City of Night whoa cmon
LA Woman LA Woman
LA Woman youre my woman
Little LA Woman Little LA Woman
LA LA Woman Woman
LA Woman cmon
