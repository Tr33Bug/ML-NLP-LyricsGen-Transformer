Dont ya love her madly
Dont ya need her badly
Dont ya love her ways
Tell me what you say
Dont you love her madly
Wanna be her daddy
Dont ya love her face
Dont ya love her as shes walkin out the door
Like she did one thousand times before
Dont you love her ways
Tell me what you say
Dont ya love her as shes walking out the door
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love
All your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark
Yeah dont you love her
Dont you love her as shes walking out the door
All your love
All your love
All your love
Yeah all your love is gone
So sing a lonely song
Of a deep blue dream
Seven horses seem to be on the mark
Dont you love her madly
Well dont ya love her madly
Dont you love her madly
