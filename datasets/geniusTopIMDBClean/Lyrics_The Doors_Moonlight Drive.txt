Lets swim to the moon uh huh
Lets climb through the tide
Penetrate the evening that the
City sleeps to hide
Lets swim out tonight love
Its our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Lets swim to the moon uh huh
Lets climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothing left open
And no time to decide
Weve stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Lets swim to the moon
Lets climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I cant be your guide
Easy I love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive baby
Moonlight drive
Come on baby gonna take a little ride
Down down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin down down down
