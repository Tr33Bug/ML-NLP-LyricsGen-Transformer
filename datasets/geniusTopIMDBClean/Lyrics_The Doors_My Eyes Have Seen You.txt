My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you stand in your door
Meet inside show me some more
Show me some more
Show me some more
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you turn and stare
Fix your hair move upstairs
Move upstairs
Move upstairs
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you free from disguise
Gazing on a city under television skies
Television skies
Television skies
My eyes have seen you
My eyes have seen you
Eyes have seen you let them photograph your soul
Memorize your alleys on an endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll
