Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but
Run run run
Lets run
Lets run
House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Come on baby run with me
Lets run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you wont know a thing till you get inside
Dead presidents corpse in the drivers car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run
Whoa


Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake
The ministers daughters in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up girl were almost home
Ya come on
We should see the gates by morning
We should be inside by evening
Sun sun sun
Burn burn burn
Soon soon soon
Moon moon moon
I will get you
Soon
Soon
Soon
I am the Lizard King
I can do anything
