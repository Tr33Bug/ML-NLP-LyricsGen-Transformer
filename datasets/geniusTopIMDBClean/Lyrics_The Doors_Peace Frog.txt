Theres blood in the streets its up to my ankles
She came  Blood in the streets its up to my knee
She came  Blood in the streets the town of Chicago
She came  Blood on the rise its following me
Just about the break of day
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
She came  Blood in the streets run a river of sadness
She came  Blood in the streets its up to my thigh
She came  Yeah the river runs red down the legs of the city
She came  The women are crying red rivers of weepin
She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of fantastic LA
Blood screams her brain they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union


Theres blood in the streets its up to my ankles
Blood in the streets its up to my knee
Blood in the streets the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise its following me
