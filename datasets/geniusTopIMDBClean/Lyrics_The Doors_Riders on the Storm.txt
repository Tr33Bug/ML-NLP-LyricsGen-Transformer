Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house were born
Into this world were thrown
Like a dog without a bone an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
Theres a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride sweet family will die
Killer on the road yeah
Girl you gotta love your man
Girl you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends our life will never end
Gotta love your man yeah
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house were born
Into this world were thrown
Like a dog without a bone an actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
