There will never be another one like you
There will never be another one who can
Do the things you do oh
Will you give another chance
Will you try a little try
Please stop and youll remember
We were together
Anyway alright
And if you have a certain evening
You could lend to me
Id give it all right back to you
Ahow it has to be with you
I know your moves and your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
And your mind
Will you stop and think and wonder
Just what youll see
Out on the train yard
Nursing penitentiary
Its gone I cry out long
Gohead brother
Did you stop it to consider
How it will feel
Cold grinding grizzly bear jaws
Hot on your heels
Do you often stop and whisper
Its Saturdays shore
The whole worlds a savior
Who could ever ever ever ever ever ever
Ask for more
Do you remember


Will you stop
Will you stopthe pain
And there will never be another one like you
There will never be another one who can
Do the things you do oh
Will you give another chance
Will you try a little try
Please stop and youll remember
We were together
Anyway alright
How you mustve think and wondered
How I must feel
Out on the meadows
While you run the field
Im alone for you
And I cry
The sweat look at it
Optical promise
Hahaha
Youll be dead and in hell
Before Im born
Sure thing
Bridesmaid
The only solution
Isnt it amazing
