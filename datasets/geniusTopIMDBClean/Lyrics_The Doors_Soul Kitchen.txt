Well the clock says its time to close now
I guess Id better go now
Id really like to stay here all night
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
Street lights shed their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and Ill wander baby
Stumblin in the neon groves
Well your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget learn to forget
Learn to forget learn to forget
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and Ill wander baby
Stumblin in the neon groves
Well the clock says its time to close now
I know I have to go now
I really want to stay here
All night
All night
All night
