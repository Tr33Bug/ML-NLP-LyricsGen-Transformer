Summers almost gone
Summers almost gone
Almost gone
Yeah its almost gone
Where will we be
When the summers gone
Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night we swim the laughin sea
When summers gone
Where will we be
Where will we be
Where will we be
Morning found us calmly unaware
Noon burned gold into our hair
At night we swim the laughin sea
When summers gone
Where will we be
Summers almost gone
Summers almost gone
We had some good times
But theyre gone
The winters coming on
Summers almost gone
