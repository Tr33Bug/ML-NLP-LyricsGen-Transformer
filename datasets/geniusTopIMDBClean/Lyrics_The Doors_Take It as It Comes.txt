Time to live
Time to lie
Time to laugh
Time to die
Take it easy baby
Take it as it comes
Dont move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh youve been moving much too fast
Time to walk
Time to run
Time to aim your arrows
At the sun
Takes it easy baby
Take it as it comes
Dont move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh youve been moving much too fast
Go real slow
You like it more and more
Take it as it comes
Specialize in having fun
Takes it easy baby
Take it as it comes
Dont move too fast
And you want your love to last
Oh youve been moving much too fast
Moving much too fast
Moving much too fast
