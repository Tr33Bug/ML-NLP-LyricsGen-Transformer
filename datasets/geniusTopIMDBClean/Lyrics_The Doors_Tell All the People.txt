Gonna bury all our troubles in the sand oh yeah
Cant you see the wonder at your feet
Your lifes complete follow me down
Cant you see me growing Get your guns
The time has come to follow me down
Follow me across the sea
Where milky babies seem to be
Molded flowing revelry
With the one that set them free
Tell all the people that you see
