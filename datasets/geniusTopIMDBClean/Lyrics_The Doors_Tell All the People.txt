Tell all the people that you see
Follow me follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Set them free follow me down
You tell them they dont have to run
Were gonna pick up everyone
Come out and take me by my hand
Gonna bury all our troubles in the sand oh yeah
Cant you see the wonder at your feet
Your lifes complete follow me down
Cant you see me growing Get your guns
The time has come to follow me down
Follow me across the sea
Where milky babies seem to be
Molded flowing revelry
With the one that set them free
Tell all the people that you see
Its just me follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Follow me follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Well be free follow me down
Tell all the people that you see
Its just me follow me down
Tell all the people that you see

Well be free follow me down
Tell all the people you see
Follow me got to follow me down
