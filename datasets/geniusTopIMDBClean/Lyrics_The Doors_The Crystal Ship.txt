Before you slip into unconsciousness
Id like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss another kiss
The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
Well meet again well meet again
Oh tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
Youd rather cry Id rather fly
The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back Ill drop a line
