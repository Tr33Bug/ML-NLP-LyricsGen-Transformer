Wow Im sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
Souths cruel bindings
The servants have the power
Dogmen and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors
Im sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV tower
I want roses in my garden bower dig
Royal babies rubies must now replace
Aborted strangers in the mud
These mutants bloodmeal
For the plant thats plowed
They are waiting to take us
Into the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillfull
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced unplanned for
Like a scaring overfriendly guest
Youve brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as ravens claws
No more money no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until its other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family
