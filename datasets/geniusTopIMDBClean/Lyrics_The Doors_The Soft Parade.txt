When I was back there in seminary school
There was a person there
Who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
You cannot petition the Lord with prayer
Can you give me sanctuary
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide
Can you find me soft asylum
I cant make it anymore
The Man is at the door
Peppermint miniskirts chocolate candy
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy
Theres only four ways to get unraveled
One is to sleep and the other is travel da da
One is a bandit up in the hills
One is to love your neighbor til
His wife gets home
Catacombs
Nursery bones
Winter women
Growing stones
Carrying babies
To the river
Streets and shoes
Avenues
Letter writers
Selling news
The monk bought lunch
Ha ha he bought a little
Yes he did
Woo
This is the best part of the trip
This is the trip the best part
I really like
Whatd he say
Yeah
Yeah right
Pretty good huh
Huh
Yeah Im proud to be a part of this number
Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way
Gentle streets where people play
Welcome to the Soft Parade
All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave
Must be something else we say
Somehow to defend this place
Everything must be this way
Everything must be this way yeah
The Soft Parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
A cobra on my left
Leopard on my right yeah
The deer woman in a silk dress
Girls with beads around their necks
Kiss the hunter of the green vest
Who has wrestled before
With lions in the night
Out of sight
The lights are getting brighter
The radio is moaning
Calling to the dogs
There are still a few animals
Left out in the yard
But its getting harder
To describe sailors
To the underfed
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
What got us this far
To this mild equator
We need someone or something new
Something else to get us through yeah come on
Calling on the dogs
Calling on the dogs
Oh its getting harder
Calling on the dogs
Calling in the dogs
Calling all the dogs
Calling on the gods
You got to meet me
Too late baby
Slay a few animals
At the crossroads
Too late
All in the yard
But its getting harder
By the crossroads
You got to meet me
Oh were going were going great
At the edge of town
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
Having a good time
Got to come along
What got us this far
To this mild equator
Outskirts of the city
You and I
We need someone new
Something new
Something else to get us through
Better bring your gun
Better bring your gun
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
Were going to ride and have some fun
When all else fails
We can whip the horses eyes
And make them sleep
And cry
