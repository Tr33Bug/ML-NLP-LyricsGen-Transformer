Wait until the war is over
And were both a little older
The unknown soldier
Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Unborn living living dead
Bullet strikes the helmets head
And its all over for the unknown soldier
Its all over for the unknown soldier uh uh
March
Company halt
Present arms
Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder
The unknown soldier
Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Bullet strikes the helmets head
And its all over
The war is over
Its all over
War is over
Its all over baby
All over baby
Oh all right yeah
All over yeah ha ha
All over
All over baby
Oh oh yeah
All over
All over
Yeah
