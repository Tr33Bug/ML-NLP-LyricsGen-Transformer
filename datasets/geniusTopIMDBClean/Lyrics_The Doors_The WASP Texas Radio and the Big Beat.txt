The WASP  Texas Radio and the Big Beat  LyricsI wanna tell you bout Texas radio and the big beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps cool and slow
With plenty of precision
The back beat narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others mean and rueful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin route
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
The negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying forget the night
Live with us in forests of azure
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned immaculate
Now listen to this and Ill tell you bout the heartache
Ill tell you bout the heartache and the loss of God
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
Ill tell you bout the maiden with wrought iron soul
Ill tell you this no eternal reward will forgive us now
For wasting the dawn
Ill tell you bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft driven slow and mad like some new language
Now listen to this and Ill tell you about the Texas
Ill tell you about the Texas radio
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night
Wandering the western dream
Tell you about the maiden with wrought iron soul
