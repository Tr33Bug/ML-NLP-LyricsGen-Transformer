Yeah
Come on come on come on come on
Now touch me babe
Cant you see that I am not afraid
What was that promise that you made
Why wont you tell me what she said
What was that promise that you made
Now Im going to love you
Til the heavens stop the rain
Im going to love you
Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I
Come on come on come on come on
Now touch me babe
Cant you see that I am not afraid
What was that promise that you made
Why wont you tell me what she said
What was that promise that you made
Now Im going to love you
Til the heavens stop the rain
Im going to love you
Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and  I
Im going to love you
Til the heavens stop the rain
Im going to love you
Til the stars fall from the sky
For you and I
