Well shes fashionably lean
And shes fashionably late
Shell never wreck a scene
Shell never break a date
But shes no drag just watch the way she walks
Shes a twentieth century fox
Shes a twentieth century fox
No tears no fears
No ruined years no clocks
Shes a twentieth century fox oh yeah
Shes the queen of cool
And shes the lady who waits
Since her mind left school
It never hesitates
She wont waste time on elementary talk
Cause shes a twentieth century fox
Shes a twentieth century fox
Got the world locked up
Inside a plastic box
Shes a twentieth century fox oh yeah
Twentieth century fox oh yeah
Twentieth century fox oh
Shes a twentieth century fox
