At first flash of Eden
We raced down to the sea
Standing there on freedoms shore
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Cant you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That its time to live in the scattered sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting waiting waiting waiting
Waiting waiting waiting waiting
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to hear my song
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong
This is the strangest life Ive ever known
Cant you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That its time to live in the scattered sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
