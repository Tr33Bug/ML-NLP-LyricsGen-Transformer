Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection
Send my credentials to the House of Detention
I got some friends inside
The face in the mirror wont stop
The girl in the window wont drop
A feast of friends Alive she cried
Waiting for me outside
Before I sink into the big sleep
I want to hear
I want to hear
The scream of the butterfly
Come back baby
Back into my arm
Were gettin tired of hangin around
Waitin around with our heads to the ground
I hear a very gentle sound
Very near yet very far
Very soft yeah very clear
Come today come today
What have they done to the earth yeah
What have they done to our fair sister
Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her
Stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn
And tied her with fences and dragged her down
I hear a very gentle sound
With your ear down to the ground
We want the world and we want it
We want the world and we want it
Now
Now
Now
Persian night babe
See the light babe
Save us
Jesus
Save us
So when the musics over
When the musics over yeah
When the musics over
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Well the music is your special friend
Dance on fire as it intends
Music is your only friend
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end
