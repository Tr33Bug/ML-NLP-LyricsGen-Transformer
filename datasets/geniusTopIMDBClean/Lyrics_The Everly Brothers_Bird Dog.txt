Johnny is a joker  Hes a bird 
A very funny joker  Hes a bird 
But when he jokes my honey  Hes a dog 
His jokin aint so funny  What a dog 
Johnny is a joker thats been tryin to steal my baby  Hes a bird dog 
Johnny sings a love song  Like a bird 
Sings the sweetest love song  You ever heard 
But when he sings to my gal  What a howl 
To me hes just a wolf dog  On the prowl 
Johnny wants to fly away and puppy love my baby  Hes a bird dog 
Hey bird dog get away from my quail
Hey bird dog youre on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey dove alone
Hey bird dog get away from my chick
Hey bird dog you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own
Johnny kissed the teacher  Hes a bird 
He tiptoed up to reach her  Hes a bird 
Well hes a teachers pet now  Hes a dog 
What he wants he can get now  What a dog 
He even made the teacher let him sit next to my baby  Hes a bird dog 
Hey bird dog get away from my quail
Hey bird dog youre on the wrong trail
Bird dog you better leave my lovey dove alone
Hey bird dog get away from my chick
Hey bird dog you better get away quick
Bird dog you better find a chicken little of your own
Hes a bird
