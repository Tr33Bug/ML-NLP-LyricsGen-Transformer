Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that mightve been
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Im through with romance Im through with love
Im through with counting the stars above
And heres the reason that Im so free
My lovin baby is through with me
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think Im gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
