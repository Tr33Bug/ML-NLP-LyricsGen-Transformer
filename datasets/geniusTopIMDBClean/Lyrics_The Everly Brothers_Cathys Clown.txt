Dont want your love any more
Dont want your kisses thats for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes thats Cathys clown
Ive got to stand tall you know a man cant crawl
For when he knows youre telling lies
And he hears them passing by
Hes not a man at all
Dont want your love any more
Dont want your kisses thats for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes thats Cathys clown
When you see me shed a tear
And you know that its sincere
Dont you think its kind of sad that youre treating me so bad
Or dont you even care
Dont want your love any more
Dont want your kisses  thats for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes thats Cathys clown
Thats Cathys clown thats Cathys clown
