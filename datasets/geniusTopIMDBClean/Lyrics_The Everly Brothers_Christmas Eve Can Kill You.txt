The winters flaking snow is brushing through the pine wood trees
I stuff my hands down deep inside my coat
I think of years ago and half remembered Christmas trees
And faces that still warm me with their glow
The cold and empty evening hangs around me like a ghost
I listen to my footsteps in the snow
The sound of one man walking through the snow can break your heart
And stopping doesnt help so on Ill go
And Christmas Eve can kill you
When youre trying to hitch a ride to anywhere
The icy air Im breathings all that keeps me on my feet
I feel like Ive been walking all my life
A car goes running by the man dont even turn his head
Guess hes busy being Santa Claus tonight
The saddest part of all is knowing if I switched with him
Id leave him stumbling ragged by the road
Id ride that highway to the arms of my sweet family
And forget about the stranger in the cold
And Christmas Eve can kill you
When youre trying to hitch a ride to anywhere
And as I walk Im singing to myself O Silent Night
Hoping I can save those other souls
Oh God forgive the man that drives right by the other man
Take pity on the stranger in the cold
Cause Christmas Eve can kill you
When youre trying to hitch a ride to anywhere
