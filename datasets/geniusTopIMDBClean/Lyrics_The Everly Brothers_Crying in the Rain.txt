Ill never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurtin me
Ive got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
Ill do my cryin in the rain
If I wait for cloudy skies
You wont know the rain from the tears in my eyes
Youll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
Ill do my cryin in the rain
Rain drops fallin from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since were not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope youll never see
Some day when my cryins done
Im gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling youll
Never see me complain
Ill do my cryin in the rain
Ill do my cryin in the rain
Ill do my cryin in the rain
