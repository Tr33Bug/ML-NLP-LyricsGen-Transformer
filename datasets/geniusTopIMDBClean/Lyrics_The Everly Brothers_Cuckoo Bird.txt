Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July
It is often that I wonder
Why women love men
And I look back and I wonder
Why men are men
Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July
Gonna build me a castle
On a mountain so high
So I can see my true love
As she passes by
Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July
Jack o diamonds jack o diamonds
I know you of old
You have robbed me of my poor pockets
Of silver and gold
Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July


Ive gambled in England
And Ive gambled down in Spain
I gambled with five aces
Now Ive gambled my last game
Oh its gamblin thats brought me prison
And its gamblin thats brought me pain
Ill never see the cuckoo
Or hear her song again
Oh the cuckoo shes a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
But I never give her water
Till the fourth day of July
