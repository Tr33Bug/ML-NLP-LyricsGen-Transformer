Darlin you can count on me
Till the sun dries up the sea
Until then Ill always be devoted to you
Ill be yours through endless time
Ill adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that Im devoted to you
Ill never hurt you Ill never lie
Ill never be untrue
Ill never give you reason to cry
Id be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years my love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It cant die because Im so devoted to you
Ill never hurt you Ill never lie
Ill never be untrue
Ill never give you reason to cry
Id be unhappy if you were blue
Through the years my love will grow
Like a river it will flow
It cant die because Im so devoted to you
