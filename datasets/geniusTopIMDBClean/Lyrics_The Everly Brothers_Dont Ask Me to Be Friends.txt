After all weve been
To one another
How can we become
Like sister and brother
Darling I beg of you
If our love must end
Ask me to forget you
But dont ask me to be friends
After being the one
That you took pride in
I just couldnt be
The friend youd confide in
If its goodbye for us
Well never meet again
Ask me to forget you
But dont ask me to be friends
Wanting you so badly
Needing you like this
How can I just look at
The lips that I used to kiss
If theres someone else
Dont let me see him
Cause Ill spend my life
Wishing I could be him
Darling I beg of you
If our love must end
Ask me to forget you
But dont ask me to be friends
