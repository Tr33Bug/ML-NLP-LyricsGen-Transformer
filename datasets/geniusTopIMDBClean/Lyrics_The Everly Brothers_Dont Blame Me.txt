Dont blame me for falling in love with you
Im under your spell but how can I help  it
Dont blame me
Cant you see when you do the things you do
If I cant conceal the thrill that Im feel  ing
Dont blame me
I cant help it if that doggoned  moon above
Makes me need someone like you  to love
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But dont blame me
