Some sunny day baby
When everything seems OK baby
Youll wake up and find that youre alone
Cause Ill be gone
Gone gone gone
Really gone
Done moved on
Cause you done me wrong
Everyone that you meet baby
As you walk down the street baby
Will ask you why youre walking all alone
Why youre on your own
Just say Im gone
Gone gone gone
Done moved on
Cause you done me wrong
If you change your way baby
You might get me to stay baby
Better hurry up if you dont want to be alone
Or Ill be gone
Gone gone gone
Really gone
Done moved on
Cause you done me wrong
