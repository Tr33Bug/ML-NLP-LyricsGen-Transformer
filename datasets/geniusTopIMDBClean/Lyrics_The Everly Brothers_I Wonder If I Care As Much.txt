I wonder if I care as much
As I did before
Last night I cried myself to sleep
For the one that makes me weep
I dried my eyes to greet the day
And wondered why I had to pay
The tears that I have shed by day
Give relief and wash away
The memory of the night before
I wonder if Ill suffer more
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before
My pride is made to say forgive
And take the blame for what you did
Its your mistakes Im thinkin of
I wonder if Im still in love
My heart cant thrive on misery
My life it has no destiny
When things get more than I can bear
I ask myself Do I still care
I wonder if I care as much
As I did before
