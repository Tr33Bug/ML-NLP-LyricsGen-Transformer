Im not in your town to stay
Said a lady old and gray
To the warden of the penitentiary
Im not in your town to stay
And Ill soon be on my way
Im just here to get my baby out of jail
Oh warden
Im just here to get my baby out of jail
I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldnt follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
And I feared that he had died
But at last Ive found my baby here in jail
Oh warden
At last Ive found my baby here in jail
It was just five years today
When his daddy passed away
He was found beneath the snow so cold and white
Twas then I bowed to take his ring
And his gold watch and his chain
Then the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden
The county laid his daddy in the grave
I will pawn you his watch
I will pawn you his chain
I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring
I will wash all your clothes
I will scrub all your floors
If that will get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
If that will get my baby out of jail
Then I heard the warden say
To the lady old and gray
Ill go bring your darling baby to your side
Two iron gates swung wide apart
She held her darling to her heart
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
But smiling
She kissed her baby boy and then she died
Im not in your town to stay
Said a lady old and gray
Im just here to get my baby out of jail
Yes warden
Im just here to get my baby out of jail
