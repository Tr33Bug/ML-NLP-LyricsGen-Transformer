I hope your radio wont play until Ive had my say
I hope your mail always fails to reach you
Until you want to hear from me
I hope your wristwatch goes berserk
But Im not angry Im just hurt
I hope your phone will never ring or your canary sing
I hope your car doesnt start cannot move
Until you want to be with me
I hope your brand new dress gets torn
But Im not angry just forlorn
Ill make a voodoo doll stuff it with bats and owls
Hell haunt your house Ill rattle chains
Well hang around until you call my name
And tell me that you want me back again
I hope your records always break new shoes make your feet ache
I hope your luck will get stuck on black cats
Until you want a kiss from me
I hope your TVs always bad
But Im not angry Im just sad
But Im not angry Im just sad
But Im not angry Im just sad
But Im not angry Im just sad
But Im not angry Im just sad
But Im not angry Im just sad
