No I dont think Ill ever get on a train again
Ill just smile and wave at the engineer
Ill put my guitar in a gunny sack
And walk away and I wont back
And when the whistle blows my name
Ill say
Whooooowhooo
Im on my way home again
No I dont think Ill ever come this way again
Ill be content with the pictures in my mind
Ill remember how that lonesome road
Used to press my back like a heavy load
And when the diesel calls my name
Ill say
Whooooowhooo
Im on my way home again
Monday Ill just sit and look out the window
Tuesday Ill just spend the day drinking beer
Wednesday will find me asleep at the TV
The rest of the week will be free free
No I dont think Ill ever get on a train again
Ill just smile and wave at the engineer
Ill put my guitar in a gunny sack
And walk away and I wont back
And when the whistle blows my name
Ill say
Whooo whooo
Im on my way home again
I say
Whooo whooo
Im on my way home again
Whooo whooo
Im on my way home again
Whooo whooo
Im on my way home again
