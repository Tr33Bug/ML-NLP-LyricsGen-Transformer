I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you let it be me
Dont take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that youll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that youll always let it be me
