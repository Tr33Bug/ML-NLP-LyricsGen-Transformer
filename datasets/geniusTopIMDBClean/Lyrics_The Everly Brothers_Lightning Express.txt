The lightning express from the depot so grand
Had started out on its way
All of the passengers that were on board
Seemed to be happy and gay
But one little boy who sat by himself
Was reading a letter he had
You could plainly tell by the look on his face
That the contents of it made him sad
The stern old conductor then started his round
Taking tickets from everyone there
And finally reaching the side of the boy
He gruffly demanded his fare
I have no ticket the boy then replied
But Ill pay you back someday
Then Ill put you off at the next stop we make
But he stopped when he heard the boy say
Please Mr Conductor
Dont put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away
A girl sitting near was heard to exclaim
If you put him off its a shame
Taking his hand a collection she made
The boys way was paid on the train
Im obliged to you miss for your kindness to me
Youre welcome she said never fear
Each time the conductor would pass through the car
The boys words would ring in his ear
Please Mr Conductor
Dont put me off of this train
The best friend I have in this world sir
Is waiting for me in pain
Expecting to die any moment sir
And may not live through the day
I wanna reach home and kiss mother goodbye
Before God takes her away
