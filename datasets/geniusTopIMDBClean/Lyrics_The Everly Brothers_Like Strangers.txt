Like strangers
Thats what we are
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far
Like strangers
How can it be
Only days ago we loved so tenderly
I love you truly I do
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too
Lets forget that weve been angry
Lets be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers anymore
Lets forget that weve been angry
Lets be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers anymore
