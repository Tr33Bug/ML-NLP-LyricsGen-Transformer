Love hurts love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Love hurts
Im young I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
Ive learned from you
Ive really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a stove
It burns you when its hot
Love hurts
Love hurts
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But theyre not foolin me
I know it isnt true
Know it isnt true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts
