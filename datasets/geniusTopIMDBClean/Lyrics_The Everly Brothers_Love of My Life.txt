Love of my life
Come close to me
Say you will always be true
Our love must be sweet destiny
Love of my life I love you
No other love could thrill me so completely
No other lips could satisfy me
Baby baby dont deny me
My hungry arms
Long for your charms
Mmmm love of my life I love you
No other love could thrill me so completely
No other lips could satisfy me
Baby baby dont deny me
My hungry arms
Long for your charms
Mmmm love of my life I love you
Love of my life I love you
