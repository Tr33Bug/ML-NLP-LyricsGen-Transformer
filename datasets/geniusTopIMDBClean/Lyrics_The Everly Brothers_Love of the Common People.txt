Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do hm hm hm
Tears from your little sister
Crying cause she doesnt have a dress without a patch
For the party to go
Oh but you know shell get by
Because shes
Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddys gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Mamas gonna love her just as much as she can
And she can
Its a good thing you dont have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And youd lose it in the snow on the ground
Walking to town and find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
Boy youd better go home where its warm
Where you can
Live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can
And she can
Living on a dreams aint easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
Ah you take em in stride for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
Maybe a prayer
Making me strong where you belong
Where you can
Live in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can
Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can
