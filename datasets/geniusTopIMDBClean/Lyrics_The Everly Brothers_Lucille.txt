Lucille you dont do your daddys will
Lucille you dont do your daddys will
Theres aint nothing to you but I love you still
Lucille please come back where you belong
Lucille please come back where you belong
Ive been good to you baby please dont leave me alone
I woke up this morning Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about her all their lips were tight
Lucille please come back where you belong
Ive been good to you baby please dont leave me alone
Ooohhhhhh
Lucille you dont do your daddys will
Lucille you dont do your daddys will
There aint nothing to you but I love you still
Ooohhhhhh
