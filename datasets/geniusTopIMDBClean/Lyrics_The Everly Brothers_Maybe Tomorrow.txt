I know well love again
Maybe tomorrow
I dont know where or when
Maybe tomorrow
You say you say youre gonna cry
Because theyve made us say goodbye
Our love will stand their test of time
And our ages wont be there to draw the line
I know well love again
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
I dont know where or when
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow
