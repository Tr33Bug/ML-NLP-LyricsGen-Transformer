They called her frivolous Sal
A peculiar sort of a gal
With a heart that was mellow
An all round good fellow
Was my old pal
Your troubles sorrow and cares
She was always willing to share
A wild sort of devil
But dead on the level
Was my gal Sal
Your troubles sorrow and cares
She was always willing to share
A wild sort of devil
But dead on the level
Was my gal Sal
