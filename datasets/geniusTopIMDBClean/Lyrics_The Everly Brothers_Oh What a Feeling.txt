It must be love
Oh what a feeling
I sit at home alone
I wait here by the phone
I know youll never call
Oh what a feeling
It must be love
Although its bitter
It must be love
I cant forget her
The days turn into weeks
Your letters I shall keep
The ones you didnt write
Oh what a feeling
It must be love
Oh what a feeling
It must be love
Oh what a feeling
