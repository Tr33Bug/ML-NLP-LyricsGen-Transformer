When I love
I get a feeling like Im travelling through the sky
On the wings of a nightingale
As I ride
My head is reeling but I dont even wonder why
On the wings of a nightingale Ill fly
High above land and sea
Ill be thinking of you and me
Couldnt ask for a better place to be
Oh I can feel something happening
Oh I can feel something happening
Oh I can feel something happening to me
So hold my hand
I got a feeling that the journey has just begun
On the wings of a nightingale
And if you like
Well fly together to the land of eternal sun
On the wings of a nightingale of love
High above land and sea
Ill be thinking of you and me
Couldnt ask for a better place to be
Oh I can feel something happening
Oh I can feel something happening
Oh I can feel something happening to me
When I love
I get a feeling like Im travelling through the sky
On the wings of a nightingale
On the wings of a nightingale
On the wings of a nightingale fly
On the wings of a nightingale
