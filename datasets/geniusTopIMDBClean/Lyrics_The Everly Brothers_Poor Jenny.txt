I took my little Jenny to a party last night
At ten oclock it ended in a heckuva fight
When someone hit my Jenny she went out like a light
Poor Jenny
And then some joker went and called the cops on the phone
So everybody scattered out for places unknown
I couldnt carry Jenny so I left her alone
Poor Jenny
Well Jenny had her picture in the paper this mornin
She made it with a bang
Accordin to the story in the paper this mornin
Jenny is the leader of a teenage gang
Jenny has a brother and hes hot on my trail
Her daddy wants to ride me out of town on a rail
I hope Ill be around when Jenny gets outta jail
Poor Jenny
I went downtown to see her she was locked in a cell
She wasnt very glad to see me that I could tell
In fact to tell the truth she wasnt lookin too well
Poor Jenny
Her eye was black her face was red her hair was a fright
She looked as though shed been acryin half of the night
I told her I was sorry she said Get out of sight
Poor Jenny
It seems a shame that Jenny had to go get apprehended a heckuva fate
This party was the first one she ever had attended
It had to happen on our very first date
Jenny has a brother and hes hot on my trail
Her daddy wants to ride me out of town on a rail
I hope Ill be around when Jenny gets out of jail
Poor Jenny
