Problems problems problems all day long
Will my problems work out right or wrong
My baby dont like anything I do
My teacher seems to feel the same way too
Worries worries pile up on my head
Woe is me I should have stayed in bed
Cant get the car my marks aint been so good
My love life just aint swingin like it should
Problems problems problems
Theyre all on accounta my lovin you like I do
Problems problems problems
They wont be solved until Im sure of you
You can solve my problems with a love thats true
Problems problems problems all day long
Problems problems problems all day long
