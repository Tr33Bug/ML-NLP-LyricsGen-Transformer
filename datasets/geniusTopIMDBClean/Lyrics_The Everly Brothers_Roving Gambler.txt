I am a roving gambler Ive gambled down in town
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards I lay my money down
Lay my money down lay my money down
I had not been in Washington many more weeks than three
Til I fell in love with a pretty little girl she fell in love with me
Fell in love with me fell in love with me
She took me in her parlour she cooled me with her fan
She whispered low in her mommas ear I love that gambling man
Love that gamblin man love that gamblin man
Daughter oh dear daughter how can you treat me so
To leave your dear old mother and with a gambler go
With a gambler go with a gambler go
Ive gambled down in Washington Ive gambled down in Spain
Im goin down in Georgia to gamble my last game
Gamble my last game gamble my last game
Mother oh dear mother you know I love you well
But the love I have for the gambling man no human tongue can tell
No human tongue can tell no human tongue can tell
I hear that train acoming coming round the curve
Awhistling and ablowing straining every nerve
Strainin every nerve strainin every nerve
Mother oh dear mother Ill tell you if I can
If you ever see me comin back Ill be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man
Be with the gambling man
I am a roving gambler Ive gambled down in town
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards I lay my money down
Lay my money down lay my money down
