Should we tell him
To let him go on trusting isnt fair
HmHmHmHm
Should we tell him
Should we tell him that his girl doesnt care
I took my best girl dancing
Down to my best friends mansion
He met us at the door said Glad youre here
Before the dance was over
I saw him call her over
Then he whispered
Thought I didnt hear
Should we tell him
To let him go on trusting isnt fair
HmHmHmHm
Should we tell him
Should we tell him that his girl doesnt care
I left them there together
Thought that I might feel better
Down at this caf where we used to go
Some of my friends had gathered
Just for some fun and laughter
Then I heard two of them atalking low
Should we tell him
To let him go on trusting isnt fair
HmHmHmHm
Should we tell him
Should we tell him that his girl doesnt care
