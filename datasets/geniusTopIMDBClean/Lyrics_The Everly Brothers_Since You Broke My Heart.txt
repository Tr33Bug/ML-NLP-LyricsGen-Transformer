They say the blues went out of style
To cry is to act just like a child
Smile each day that were apart
But I cant agree I never will
Since you broke my heart
They say the best ways not to care
Just play a few hands of solitaire
Read a book or study art
All the remedies dont work for me
Since you broke my heart
