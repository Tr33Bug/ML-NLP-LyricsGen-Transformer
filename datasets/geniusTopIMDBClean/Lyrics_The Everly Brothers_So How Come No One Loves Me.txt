So How Come  No One Loves Me  LyricsThey say that everyone needs someone
So how come no one needs me
And they say that everyone wants someone
So how come no one wants me
If you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Theyre the Ugly Duckling the Little Black Sheep and me uhhuh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me
If you wonder who the loneliest creatures in the world can be
Theyre the Ugly Duckling the Little Black Sheep and me uhhuh
They say that everyone loves someone
So how come no one loves me
So how come no one loves me
So how come no one loves me
