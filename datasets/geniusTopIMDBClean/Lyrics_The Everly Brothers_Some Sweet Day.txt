Some sweet day
Some sweet day
Im gonna hold you like I want to
Im gonna kiss you like want to
Im gonna love you like I need to
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
You will say
That you have started dreamin of me
That you love no one else above me
Ill find a way to make you love me
Some sweet day
I hope it wont be long till I can take and make you my very own
Cause baby doll I get so tired of wishin and dreamin alone
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
Youll get that twinkle in your eye love
You gonna look at me and sigh love
And then youll tell me that youre my love
Some sweet day
I hope wont be long till I can take and make you my very own
Cause baby doll I get so tired of wishin and dreamin alone
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
Youll get that twinkle in your eye love
You gonna look at me sigh love
And then youll tell me that youre my love
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
Some sweet day
