These are the words of a frontier lad
Who lost his love when he turned bad
Take a message to Mary
But dont tell her where I am
Take a message to Mary
But dont say Im in a jam
You can tell her I had to see the world
Or tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she better not wait for me
But dont tell her Im in jail
Oh dont tell her Im in jail
Take a message to Mary
But dont tell her what Ive done
Please dont mention the stagecoach
And the shot from a careless gun
You can tell her I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding day
But please dont mention my lonely cell
Where Im gonna pine away
Until my dying day
Take a message to Mary
But dont tell her all you know
My hearts aching for Mary
Lord knows I miss her so
Just tell her I went to Timbuktu
Tell her Im searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold
Oh Lord this cell is cold
Mary Mary
Oh Lord this cell is cold
