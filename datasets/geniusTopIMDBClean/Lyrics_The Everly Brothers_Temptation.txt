Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
Oh 
You came I was alone
I should have known
You were temptation
You sighed leading me on
I should have known
You were temptation
It would be thrilling if you were willing
But if it can never be
Well then pity me
You were born to be kissed
I cant resist
You are temptation
I m yours here is my heart
Take it and say Well never part 
Im just a slave
Only a slave
Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
Oh 
Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
Yea yea yea yeah
