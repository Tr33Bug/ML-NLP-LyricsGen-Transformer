Thats Old Fashioned  Thats the Way Love Should Be  LyricsWe hold hands in the movie show
So they say that were old fashioned
Or we stroll beneath the silvry moon oooooooon
And we carve our initials in the old oak tree
Thats old fashioned thats the way love should be
We enjoy sitting side by side
In the booth in the ice cream parlor
Where we play the nickelodeon ahahahahn
And we dance when we hear our favorite melody
Thats old fashioned thats the way love should be
Its a modern changing world
Everything is moving fast
But when it comes to love I like
What they did in the past
Im the kind who loves only one
So the boys say Im old fashioned
Let them laugh honey I dont miiiiind
Ive made plans for a wedding day for you and me
Thats old fashioned thats the way love should be
