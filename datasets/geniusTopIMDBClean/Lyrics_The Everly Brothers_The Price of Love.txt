Wine is sweet and gin is bitter
Drink all you can but you wont forget her
You talk too much you laugh too loud
You see her face in every crowd
Thats the price of love
The price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love
The price of love
Can cost you more when youre to blame
Kiss one girl kiss another
Kiss them all but you wont recover
Youre dancing slow youre dancing fast
Youre happy now but that wont last
Thats the price of love
The price of love
The debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love
The price of love
Costs you more when youre to blame
