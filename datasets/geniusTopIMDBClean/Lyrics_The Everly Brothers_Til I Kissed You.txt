Til  I Kissed You Lyrics
Never felt like this until I kissed ya
How did I exist until I kissed ya
Never had you on my mind
Now youre there all the time
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya
Uhhuh I kissed ya oh yeah
Things have really changed since I kissed ya uhhuh
My lifes not the same now that I kissed ya oh yeah
Mmm you got a way about ya
Now I cant live without ya
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya
Uhhuh I kissed ya oh yeah
You dont realize what you do to me
And I didnt realize what a kiss could be
Mmm you got a way about ya
Now I cant live without ya
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya
Uhhuh I kissed ya oh yeah
You dont realize what you do to me
And I didnt realize what a kiss could be
Mmm you got a way about ya
Now I cant live without ya
Never knew what I missed til I kissed ya
Uhhuh I kissed ya oh yeah
I kissed ya uhhuh
I kissed ya oh yeah
I kissed ya
