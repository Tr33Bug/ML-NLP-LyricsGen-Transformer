Torture Torture
Baby youre torturing me
Why do you lead me around and make me chase ya
When I catch ya you wont let me embrace ya
Please baby have a heart cause cant you see
Youre torturing me torturing me
This torture that Im going through
Is worth the pain if I have you
So if you love me let me know
But if you dont please let me go
Torture Torture
Baby youre torturing me
You know that Im crazy about you
Yet you make me do without you
Do you mean to hurt or dont you see
Youre torturing me torturing me
