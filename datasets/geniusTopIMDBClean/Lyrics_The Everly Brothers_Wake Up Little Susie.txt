Wake up little Susie wake up
Wake up little Susie wake up
Weve both been sound asleep
Wake up little Susie and weep
The movies over
Its four oclock
And were in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Well what are we gonna tell your mama
What are we gonna tell your pa
What are we gonna tell all our friends
When they say Ooh la la
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Well I told your mama that
Youd be in by ten
Well Susie baby
Looks like we goofed again
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
We gotta go home
Wake up little Susie wake up
Wake up little Susie wake up


The movie wasnt so hot
It didnt have much of a plot
We fell asleep
Our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Well what are we gonna tell your mama
What are we gonna tell your pa
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say Ooh la la
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
