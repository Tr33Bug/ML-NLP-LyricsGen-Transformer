I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
Im so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothin seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away oh me
Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me dont send it
Im so lonesome every day
I want you to tell me why you walked out on me
Im so lonesome every day
I want you to know that since you walked out on me
Nothin seems to be the same old way
Think about the love that burns within my heart for you
The good times we had before you went away oh me
Walk right back to me this minute
Bring your love to me dont send it
Im so lonesome every day
Im so lonesome every day
Im so lonesome every day
