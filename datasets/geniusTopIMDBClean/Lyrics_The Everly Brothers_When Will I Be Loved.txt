Ive been made blue
Ive been lied to
When will I be loved
Ive been turned down
Ive been pushed round
When will I be loved
When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Ive been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved
When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Ive been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
