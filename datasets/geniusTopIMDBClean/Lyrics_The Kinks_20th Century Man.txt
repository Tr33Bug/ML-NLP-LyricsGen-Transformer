This is the age of machinery
A mechanical nightmare
The wonderful world of technology
Napalm hydrogen bombs biological warfare
This is the twentieth century
But too much aggravation
Its the age of insanity
What has become of the green pleasant fields of Jerusalem
Aint got no ambition Im just disillusioned
Im a twentiethcentury man but I dont want I dont wanna be here
My mama said she cant understand me
She cant see my motivation
Just give me some security
Im a paranoid schizoid product of the twentieth century
You keep all your smart modern writers
Give me William Shakespeare
You keep all your smart modern painters
Ill take Rembrandt Titian Da Vinci and Gainsborough
Girl we gotta get out of here
We gotta find a solution
Im a twentiethcentury man but I dont want I dont want to die here
Girl we gotta get out of here
We gotta find a solution
Im a twentiethcentury man but I dont want I dont want to be here
I was born in a welfare state
Ruled by bureaucracy
Controlled by civil servants
And people dressed in grey
Got no privacy got no liberty
Cause the twentiethcentury people
Took it all away from me
Dont wanna get myself shot down
By some trigger happy policeman
Gotta keep a hold on my sanity
Im a twentiethcentury man but I dont wanna die here
My mama says she cant understand me
She cant see my motivation
Aint got no security
Im a twentiethcentury man but I dont wanna die here
I dont want twentiethcentury man
No more twentiethcentury man
I dont want twentiethcentury man
This is the twentieth century
But too much aggravation
This is the edge of insanity
Im a twentiethcentury man but I dont wanna be here
