Now I wanna tell you a little story
About the old demon alcohol
Yes indeed my little chickadee
Here is a story about a sinner
He used to be a winner
Who enjoyed a life of prominence and position
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements
And his selfish wifes fanatical ambition
It turned him to the booze
And he got mixed up with a floosie
And she led him to a life of indecision
The floosie made him spend his dough
She left him lying on Skid Row
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission
Its such a shame
Oh demon alcohol
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would say
Damn it all and blow it all
Oh demon alcohol
Memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol
Barley wine pink gin
Hell drink anything
Port pernod or tequila
Rum scotch vodka on the rocks
As long as all his troubles disappeared

But he messed up his life when he beat up his wife
And the floosies gone and found another sucker
Shes gonna turn him on to drink
Shes gonna lead him to the brink
And when his moneys gone
Shell leave him in the gutter
Its such a shame
Oh demon alcohol
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
Damn it all low low
Sad memories I cant recall
Who thought I would fall
A slave to demon alcohol
