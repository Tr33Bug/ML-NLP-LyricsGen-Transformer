I think Im sophisticated
Cause Im living my life like a good homosapien
But all around me everybodys multiplying
Til theyre walking round like flies man
So Im no better than the animals sitting in their cages
In the zoo man
Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an ape man
I think Im so educated and Im so civilized
Cause Im a strict vegetarian
But with the overpopulation and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I dont feel safe in this world no more
I dont want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man
Im an ape man
Im an ape ape man
Im an ape man
Im a King Kong man
Im voodoo man
Im an ape man
Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an ape man
In mans evolution he has created the city and
The motor traffic rumble but give me half a chance
And Id be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle
Cause the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury
To be like an ape man
Im an ape man
Im an ape ape man
Im an ape man
Im a King Kong man
Im a voodoo man
Im an ape man
I look out the window but I cant see the sky
Cause the air pollution is afogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an ape man
Come on and love me
Be my ape man girl
And well be so happy
In my ape man world
Im an ape man
Im an ape ape man
Im an ape man
Im a King Kong man
Im a voodoo man
Im an ape man
Ill be your Tarzan youll be my Jane
Ill keep you warm and youll keep me sane
And well sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an ape man
Im an ape man Im an ape ape man Im an ape man
Im a King Kong man Im a voodoo man
Im an ape man
I dont feel safe in this world no more
I dont want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an ape man
