Arthur was born just a plain simple man
In a plain simple working class position
Though the world was hard and its ways were set
He was young and he had so much ambition
All the way he was overtaken
By the people who make the big decisions
But he tried and he tried for a better life
And a way to improve his own condition
If only life were easy it would be such fun
Things would be more equal and be plenty for everyone
Arthur the worlds gone and passed you by
Dont you know it dont you know it
You can cry cry all night but it wont make it right
Dont ya know it dont ya know it
Arthur we know and we sympathize
Dont ya know it dont ya know it
Arthur we like you and want to help you
Somebody loves you dont you know it
How is your life and your Shangrila
And your long lost land of Hallelujah
And your hope and glory has passed you by
Cant you see what the world is doing to ya
And now we see your children sailing off in the setting sun
To a new horizon where theres plenty for everyone
Arthur could be that the world was wrong
Dont ya know it dont ya know it
Arthur could be you were right all along
Dont ya know it I hope ya know it
Now we know and we sympathize
Wed like to help you and understand you
Dont ya know it dont ya know it
Somebody loves you dont ya know it
Dont ya know it dont ya know it

Arthur the worlds gone and passed you by
Dont ya know it dont ya know it
You can cry cry all night
But it wont make it right
Dont ya know it dont ya know it
Arthur we read you and understand you
Arthur we like you and want to help you
Oh we love you and want to help you
