Opportunities are available in all walks of life in Australia
So if youre young and if youre healthy
Why not get a boat and come to Australia
Australia the chance of a lifetime
Australia you get what you work for
Nobody has to be any better than what they want to be
Australia no class distinction
Australia no drug addiction
Nobodys got a chip on their shoulder
Well surf like they do in the USA
Well fly down to Sydney for our holiday
On sunny Christmas day
Australia Australia
No one hesitates at life or beats around the bush in Australia
So if youre young and if youre healthy
Why not get a boat and come to Australia
Australia shalalala shalalala
Australia shalalala shalalala
Everyone walks around with a perpetual smile across their face
Australia shalalala shalalala
Australia shalalala shalalala
Everyone gets around and nobody can ever get you down
Well surf like they do in the USA
Well fly down to Sydney for our holiday
On sunny Christmas day
Australia Australia
