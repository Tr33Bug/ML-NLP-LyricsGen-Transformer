From the dewsoaked hedge creeps a crawly caterpillar
When the dawn begins to crack
Its all part of my autumn almanac
Breeze blows leaves of a mustycoloured yellow
So I sweep them in my sack
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac
Friday evenings people get together
Hiding from the weather
Tea and toasted buttered currant buns
Cant compensate for lack of sun
Because the summers all gone
Lalalala
Oh my poor rheumatic back
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac
Lalalala
Oh my autumn almanac
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac
I like my football on a Saturday
Roast beef on Sundays all right
I go
To Blackpool for my holidays
Sit in the open sunlight
This is my street and Im never gonna to leave it
And Im always gonna to stay here
If I live to be ninetynine
Cause all the people I meet
Seem to come from my street
And I cant get away
Because its calling me  come on home 
Hear it calling me  come on home 
Lalalala
Oh my autumn Armagnac
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac
Lalalala
Oh my autumn almanac
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Bopbopbopmbopbop whoa
Bopbopbopmbopbop whoa
