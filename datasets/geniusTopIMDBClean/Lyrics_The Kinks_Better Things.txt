Heres wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way
Heres hoping all the days ahead
Wont be as bitter as the ones behind you
Be an optimist instead
And somehow happiness will find you
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on the way
Its really good to see you rocking out and having fun
Living like you just begun
Accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow youll find better things
I know tomorrow youll find better things
Heres wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way
I know youve got a lot of good things happening up ahead
The past is gone its all been said
So heres to what the future brings
I know tomorrow youll find better things
I know tomorrow youll find better things
I hope tomorrow youll find better things
I know tomorrow youll find better things
