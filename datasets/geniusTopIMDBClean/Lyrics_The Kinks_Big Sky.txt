Big Sky LyricsBig Sky looked down on all the people looking up at the Big Sky
Everybody's pushing one another around
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down
Big Sky too big to cry
Big Sky too high to see
People like you and me
One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down
And when I feel
That the world's too much for me
I think of the Big Sky
And nothing matters much to me

Big Sky looked down on all the people who think they got problems
They get depressed and they hold their heads in their hands and they cry
People lift up their hands and they look up to the Big Sky
But the Big Sky is too big to sympathise

Big Sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
And he feels bad inside
Big Sky's too big to cry

One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you downYou might also like1Embed
