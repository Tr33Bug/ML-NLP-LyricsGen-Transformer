They put a parking lot on a piece of land
Where the supermarket used to stand
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local Palais
Thats where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday
Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing
Its only natural
Another Saturday another date
She would be ready but shes always make them wait
In the hallway in anticipation
He didnt know the night would end up in frustration
Hed end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek
Come dancing
Thats how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did
My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mum would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late
Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate
The day they knocked down the Palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the Palais
Part of my childhood died just died
Now Im grown up and playing in a band
And theres a car park where the Palais used to stand
My sisters married and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out now its her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

Come dancing
Come on sister have yourself a ball
Dont be afraid to come dancing
Its only natural
Come dancing
Just like the Palais on a Saturday
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play
