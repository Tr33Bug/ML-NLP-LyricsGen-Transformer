Thank you for the days
Those endless days those sacred days you gave me
Im thinking of the days
I wont forget a single day believe me
I bless the light
I bless the light that lights on you believe me
And though youre gone
Youre with me every single day believe me
Days Ill remember all my life
Days when you cant see wrong from right
You took my life
But then I knew that very soon youd leave me
But its alright
Now Im not frightened of this world believe me
I wish today could be tomorrow
The night is dark
It just brings sorrow let it wait
Thank you for the days
Those endless days those sacred days you gave me
Im thinking of the days
I wont forget a single day believe me
Days Ill remember all my life
Days when you cant see wrong from right
You took my life
But then I knew that very soon youd leave me
But its alright
Now Im not frightened of this world believe me
Days
Thank you for the days
Those endless days those sacred days you gave me
Im thinking of the days
I wont forget a single day believe me
I bless the light
I bless the light that shines on you believe me
And though youre gone
Youre with me every single day believe me
Days
