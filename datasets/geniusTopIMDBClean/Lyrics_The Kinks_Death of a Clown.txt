Death of a Clown Lyrics[Verse 1]
My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin
I'm drowning my sorrows in whisky and gin
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go and drink to the death of a clown

[Chorus]
Won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
[Verse 2]
The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees
And frantically looking for runaway fleas

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

[Chorus]
So won't someone help me to break up this crown
Let's all drink to the death of a clown
Let's all drink to the death of a clownYou might also likeEmbed
