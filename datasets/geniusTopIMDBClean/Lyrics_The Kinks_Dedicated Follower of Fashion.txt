They seek him here they seek him there
His clothes are loud but never square
It will make or break him so hes got to buy the best
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion
And when he does his little rounds
Round the boutiques of London Town
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
He thinks he is a flower to be looked at
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
Theres one thing that he loves and that is flattery
One week hes in polka dots the next week hes in stripe
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion
They seek him here they seek him there
In Regent Street and Leicester Square
Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on
Each one a dedicated follower of fashion
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
His world is built round discotheques and parties
This pleasureseeking individual always looks his best
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
Oh yes he is  Oh yes he is 
He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly
In matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion
Hes a dedicated follower of fashion
Hes a dedicated follower of fashion
