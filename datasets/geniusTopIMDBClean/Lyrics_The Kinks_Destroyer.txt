Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place
Feelin guilty feelin scared hidden cameras everywhere
Stop Hold on stay in control
Girl I want you here with me
But Im really not as cool as Id like to be
Cause theres a red under my bed
And theres a little yellow man in my head
And theres a true blue inside of me
That keeps stoppin me touchin ya watchin ya lovin ya
Paranoia the destroyer
Paranoia the destroyer
Well I fell asleep then I woke feelin kinda queer
Lola looked at me and said Ooh you look so weird
She said Man theres really something wrong with you
One day youre gonna selfdestruct
Youre up youre down I cant work you out
You get a good thing goin then you blow yourself out
Silly boy you selfdestroyer
Silly boy you selfdestroyer
Silly boy you got so much to live for
So much to aim for so much to try for
Youre blowing it all with paranoia
Youre so insecure you selfdestroyer
And it goes like this here it goes 
Paranoia the destroyer
Here it goes again 
Paranoia the destroyer
Doctor doctor help me please I know you will understand
Theres a time device inside of me Im a selfdestructin man
Theres a red under my bed
And theres a little green man in my head
And he said Youre not goin crazy youre just a bit sad
Cause theres a man in ya gnawin ya tearin ya into two
