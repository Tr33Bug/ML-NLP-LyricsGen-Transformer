Destroyer LyricsMet a girl called Lola, and I took her back to my place
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere
Stop! Hold on, stay in control

Girl, I want you here with me
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be
'Cause there's a red under my bed
And there's a little yellow man in my head
And there's a true blue inside of me
That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya
Paranoia, the destroyer
Paranoia, the destroyer

Well, I fell asleep, then I woke, feelin' kinda queer
Lola looked at me and said, "Ooh, you look so weird"
She said, "Man, there's really something wrong with you
One day you're gonna self-destruct

You're up, you're down, I can't work you out
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out

Silly boy, you self-destroyer
Silly boy, you self-destroyer

Silly boy, you got so much to live for
So much to aim for, so much to try for
You're blowing it all with paranoia
You're so insecure, you self-destroyer"

(And it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Here it goes again)
Paranoia, the destroyer

Doctor, doctor help me please, I know you will understand
There's a time device inside of me, I'm a self-destructin' man
There's a red under my bed
And there's a little green man in my head
And he said, "You're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad
'Cause there's a man in ya, gnawin' ya, tearin' ya into two"

Paranoia, the destroyer

Self-destroyer, wreck your health
Destroy your friends, destroy yourself
The time device of self-destruction
Light the fuse and start eruption, yeah

(Yeah, it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Here's to paranoia)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Hey hey, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(And it goes like this)

Paranoia, the destroyer
(And it goes like this)1Embed
