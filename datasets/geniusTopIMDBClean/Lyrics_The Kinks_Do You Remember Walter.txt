Walter
Remember when the world was young and all the girls knew Walters name
Walter
Isnt it a shame the way our little world has changed
Do you remember Walter
Playing cricket in the thunder and the rain
Do you remember Walter
Smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate
Yes Walter was my mate
But Walter my old friend where are you now
Walters name
Walter
Isnt it a shame the way our little world has changed
Do you remember Walter how we said wed fight the world so wed be free
Wed save up all our money and wed buy a boat and sail away to sea
But it was not to be
I knew you then but do I know you now
Walter
You are just an echo of a world I knew so long ago
Walter
If you saw me now you wouldnt even know my name
I bet youre fat and married and youre always home in bed by halfpast eight
And if I talked about the old times youd get bored and youd have nothing more to say
Yes people often change
But memories of people can remain
