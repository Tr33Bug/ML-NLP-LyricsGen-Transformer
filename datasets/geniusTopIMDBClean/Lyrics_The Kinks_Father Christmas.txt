When I was small I believed in Santa Claus
Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stockings at Christmas
Open my presents and Id be glad
But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor
They said
Father Christmas give us some money
Dont mess around with those silly toys
Well beat you up if you dont hand it over
We want your bread so dont make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys
Dont give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Dont give my sister a cuddly toy
We dont want no jigsaw or Monopoly money
We only want the real McCoy
Father Christmas give us some money
Well beat you up if you make us annoyed
Father Christmas give us some money
Dont mess around with those silly toys
Give my daddy a job cause he needs one
Hes got lots of mouths to feed
But if youve got one Ill take a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids on the street
Father Christmas give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Well beat you up if you dont hand it over
We want your bread so dont make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys
Have yourself a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothing
While youre drinking down your wine
Father Christmas give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Father Christmas please hand it over
Well beat you up so dont make us annoyed
Father Christmas give us some money
Dont mess around with those silly toys
Beat you up if you dont hand it over
We want your bread so dont make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys
