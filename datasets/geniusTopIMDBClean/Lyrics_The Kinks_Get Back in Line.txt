Facing the world aint easy when there isnt anything going
Standing at the corner waiting watching time go by
Will I go into work today or shall I bide my time
Cause when I see that union man walking down the street
Hes the man who decides if I live or I die if I starve or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that Ive got to get back in the line
Now I think of what my mamma told me
She always said that it would never ever work out
But all I want to do is make some money
And bring you home some wine
For I dont want you ever to see me
Standing in that line
Cause that union mans got such a hold over me
Hes the man who decides if I live or I die if I starve or I eat
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine
Then he walks right past and I know that Ive got to get back in the line
