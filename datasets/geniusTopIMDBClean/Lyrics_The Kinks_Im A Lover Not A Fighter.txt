Well I met a pretty girl as pretty as can be
I thought she was my baby till she introduced to me
A great big tall fella about six foot tall
I shivered and I shook couldnt do any more
Cause Im a lover not a fighter
Yes Im a lover not a fighter
Yes Im a lover not a fighter
And Im really built for speed
Built for speed
Well some people think Im lazy but theres one thing they dont know
Cause when Im in the mood I can go caddy go
Cause Im a lover not a fighter
Yes Im a lover not a fighter
Yes Im a lover not a fighter
And Im really built for speed
Built for speed
Built for speed
Whoa yeah
Well I can roar like a lion I can sting like a bee
But some times I think baby Ive got rabbit blood in me
Cause Im a lover not a fighter
Yes Im a lover not a fighter
Yes Im a lover not a fighter
And Im really built for speed
Built for speed
Built for speed
Whoa yeah
