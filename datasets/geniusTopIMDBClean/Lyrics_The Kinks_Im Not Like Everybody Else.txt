I wont take all that they hand me down
Make out a smile though I wear a frown
And Im not gonna take it all lying down
Cause once I get started I go to town
Cause Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
And I dont want to ball about like everybody else
And I dont want to live my life like everybody else
And I wont say that I feel fine like everybody else
Cause Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
But darling you know that I love you true
Do anything that you want me to
Confess all my sins like you want me to
Theres one thing that I will say to you
Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
And I dont want to ball about like everybody else
And I dont want to live my life like everybody else
And I wont say that I feel fine like everybody else
Cause Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
If you all want me to settle down
Then slow up and stop all my running round
Do everything like you want me to
Theres one thing that I will say to you

Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
And I dont want to ball about like everybody else
And I dont want to live my life like everybody else
And I dont want to stay fine like everybody else
Cause Im not like everybody else
Im not like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else 
Like everybody else
Like everybody else 
Like everybody else
Like everybody else 
Like everybody else
