Iâ€™m Not Like Everybody Else LyricsI won't take all that they hand me down
Make out a smile, though I wear a frown
And I'm not gonna take it all lying down
Cause once I get started, I go to town

Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

And I don't want to ball about like everybody else
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else
Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
But darling, you know that I love you true
Do anything that you want me to
Confess all my sins like you want me to
There's one thing that I will say to you

I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

And I don't want to ball about like everybody else
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I won't say that I feel fine like everybody else
Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
Like everybody else

If you all want me to settle down
Then slow up and stop all my running 'round
Do everything like you want me to
There's one thing that I will say to you
You might also likeI'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

And I don't want to ball about like everybody else
And I don't want to live my life like everybody else
And I don't want to stay fine like everybody else
Cause I'm not like everybody else
I'm not like everybody else

Like everybody else
(Like everybody else)
Like everybody else
(Like everybody else)

Like everybody else
(Like everybody else)
Like everybody else2Embed
