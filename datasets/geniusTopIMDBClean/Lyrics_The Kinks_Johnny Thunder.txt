Johnny Thunder lives on water feeds on lightning
Johnny Thunder dont need no one dont want money
And all the people of the town
They cant get through to Johnny
They will never ever break him down
Johnny Thunder speaks for no one goes on fighting
And sweet Helena Dulette prays for Johnny
Ba baba ba baba ba
Ba baba ba baba ba
Thunder and lightning
Ba baba ba baba ba
Ba baba ba baba ba
Thunder and lightning
Though everybody tried their best
Old Johnny vowed that he would never ever end up like the rest
Johnny Thunder rides the highway moves like lightning
But sweet Helena just says God bless Johnny
Ba baba ba baba ba
Ba baba ba baba ba
Thunder and lightning
Ba baba ba baba ba
Ba baba ba baba ba
Thunder and lightning
