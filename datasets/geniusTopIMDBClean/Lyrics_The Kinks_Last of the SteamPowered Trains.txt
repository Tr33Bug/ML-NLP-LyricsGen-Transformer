Like the last of the good ol puffer trains
Im the last of the blood and sweat brigade
And I dont know where Im going or why I came
Im the last of the good old fashioned steampowered trains
Im the last of the good old renegades
All my friends are all middle class and grey
But I live in a museum so Im okay
Im the last of the good old fashioned steampowered trains
Like the last of the good ol choochoo trains
I huff and puff till I blow this world away
And Im gonna keep on rollin till my dying day
Im the last of the good old fashioned steampowered trains
Like the last of the good ol puffer trains
Im the last of the soot and scum brigade
And all this peaceful living is drivin me insane
Im the last of the good old fashioned steampowered trains
Im the last of the good old fashioned steampowered trains
