All the stories have been told
Of kings and days of old
But theres no England now  theres no England now 
All the wars that were won and lost
Somehow dont seem to matter very much anymore
All the lies we were told  all the lies we were told 
All the lies of the people running round
Their castles have burned
Now I see change
But inside were the same as we ever were
Living on a thin line
Tell me now what are we supposed to do
Living on a thin line  living on a thin line 
Tell me now what are we supposed to do
Living on a thin line  living on a thin line 
Living this way each day is a dream
What am I what are we supposed to do
Living on a thin line  living on a thin line 
Tell me now what are we supposed to do
Now another century nearly gone  gone 
What are we gonna leave for the young
What we couldnt do what we wouldnt do
Its a crime but does it matter
Does it matter much does it matter much to you
Does it ever really matter
Yes it really really matters
Living on a thin line  living on a thin line 
Tell me now what are we supposed to do
Living on a thin line  living on a thin line 
Tell me now what are we supposed to do
Then another leader says
Break their hearts and break some heads
Is there nothing we can say or do
Blame the future on the past
Always lost in bloody guts
And when theyre gone its me and you
Living on a thin line
Tell me now what are we supposed to do
Living on a thin line  living on a thin line 
Tell me now what are we supposed to do
Living on a thin line
