Living on a Thin Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
All the stories have been told
Of kings and days of old
But there's no England now (there's no England now)
All the wars that were won and lost
Somehow don't seem to matter very much anymore
All the lies we were told (all the lies we were told)
All the lies of the people running round
Their castles have burned
Now I see change
But inside we're the same as we ever were
[Chorus]
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line (living on a thin line)
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line (living on a thin line)
Living this way, each day is a dream
What am I, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line (living on a thin line)
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

[Verse 2]
Now another century nearly gone (gone)
What are we gonna leave for the young?
What we couldn't do, what we wouldn't do
It's a crime, but does it matter?
Does it matter much, does it matter much to you?
Does it ever really matter?
Yes, it really, really matters

[Chorus]
Living on a thin line (living on a thin line)
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line (living on a thin line)
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

Then another leader says
"Break their hearts and break some heads"
Is there nothing we can say or do?
Blame the future on the past
Always lost in bloody guts
And when they're gone, it's me and you

[Chorus]
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line (living on a thin line)
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin lineEmbed
