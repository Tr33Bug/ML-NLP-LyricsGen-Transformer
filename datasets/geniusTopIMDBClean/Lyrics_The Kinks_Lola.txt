I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like CocaCola
COLA Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
LOLA Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
Well Im not the worlds most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
Well Im not dumb but I cant understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said Little boy wont you come home with me
Well Im not the worlds most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Well I looked at her and she at me
Well thats the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
Its a mixed up muddled up shook up world
Except for Lola
LoLoLoLoLola


Well Id left home just a week before
And Id never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said Little boy gonna make you a man
Well Im not the worlds most masculine man
But I know what I am and Im glad Im a man
And so is Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Lola
LoLoLoLoLola
LoLoLoLoLola
Lola
