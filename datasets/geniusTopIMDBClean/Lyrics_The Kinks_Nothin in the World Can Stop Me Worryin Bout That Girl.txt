Met a girl fell in love
Glad as I can be
Met a girl fell in love
Glad as I can be
But I think all the time
Is she true to me
Cause theres nothin in this world
To stop me worryin bout that girl
I found out I was wrong
She was just two timin
I found out I was wrong
She just kept on lyin
Now she tries to tell the truth
And I just cant believe
Cause theres nothin in this world
To stop me worryin bout that girl
Tell me who can I turn to
Just who can I believe
Tried to put her out of my mind
Shell only cause me grief
But I love that girl whatever shes done
You know it hurts me deeply
Cause theres nothin in this world
To stop me worryin bout that girl
I know shes been with other fellas
Why she keep on lyin
It hurts me so when she says nothin
I really feel like dyin
I ache inside until I think
I know its just my pride


Cause theres nothin in this world
To stop me worryin bout that girl
Cause theres nothin in this world
To stop me worryin bout that girl
