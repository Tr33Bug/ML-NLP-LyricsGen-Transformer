People Take Pictures of Each Other LyricsPeople take pictures of the summer
Just in case someone thought they had missed it
And to prove that it really existed
Fathers take pictures of the mothers
And the sisters take pictures of brothers
Just to show that they love one another
You can't picture love that you took from me
When we were young and the world was free
Pictures of things as they used to be
Don't show me no more, please
People take pictures of each other
Just to prove that they really existed
Just to prove that they really existed
People take pictures of each other
And the moment can last them forever
Of the time when they mattered to someone

People take pictures of the summer
Just in case someone thought they had missed it
Just to prove that it really existed
People take pictures of each other
Of a moment that lasts them forever
And the time when they mattered to someone

Picture of me when I was just three
Sat with my Ma by the old oak tree
How I love things as they used to be
Don't show me no more, pleaseYou might also likeEmbed
