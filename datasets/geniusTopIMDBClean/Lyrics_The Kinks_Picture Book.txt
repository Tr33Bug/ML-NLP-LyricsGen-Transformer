Picture yourself when youre getting on
Sat by the fireside apondering on
Picture book pictures of your mama
Taken by your papa a long time ago
Picture book of people with each other
To prove they love each other
A long time ago
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

A picture of you in your birthday suit
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon
Picture book your mama and your papa
And fat old Uncle Charlie
Out boozing with their friends
Picture book a holiday in August
Outside a bed and breakfast
In sunny Southend
Picture book when you were just a baby
Those days when you were happy
A long time ago
