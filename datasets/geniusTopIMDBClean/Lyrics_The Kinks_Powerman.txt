I know a man hes a powerful man
Got the people in his power in the palm of his hand
He started at the bottom but he worked his way up
Now hes never going to stop until he reaches the top
Its the same old story
Its the same old dream
Its Powerman Powerman and all that it can bring
If you want your money better stand in the line
But youll only end up picking up the nickels and dimes
You call him names and he sits and grins
Cause everybody else is just a sucker to him
And hes got my money
But Ive got my faith
And Powerman Powerman Ill never be your slave
Its the same old story
Its the same old game
Powerman Powerman hes driving me insane
People tried to conquer the world
Napoleon and Genghis Khan
Hitler tried and Mussolini too
Powerman dont need to fight
Powerman dont need no guns
Powerman got money on his side
Well Im not rich and Im not free
But Ive got my girl and she got me
Hes got my money and my publishing rights
But Ive got my girl and Im alright
And shes got me going
And she keeps me sane
Powerman Powerman got money on the brain
Its the same old story
Its the same old game
Powerman Powerman hes driving me insane
