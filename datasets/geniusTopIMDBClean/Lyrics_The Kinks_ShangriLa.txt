Now that youve found your paradise
This is your kingdom to command
You can go outside and polish your car
Or sit by the fire in your ShangriLa
Heres your reward for working so hard
Gone are the lavatries in the back yard
Gone are the days when you dreamed of that car
You just want to sit in your ShangriLa
Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
Youve reached your top and you just cant get any higher
Youre in your place and you know where you are
In your ShangriLa
Sit back in your old rockingchair
You need not worry you need not care
You cant go anywhere
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaaaaaaaa
The little man who gets the train
Got a mortgage hangin over his head
But hes too scared to complain
Cause hes conditioned that way
Time goes by and he pays off his debt
Got a TV set and a radio
For seven shillings a week
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaaaaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaaaaaaaa


And all the houses in the street have got a name
Cause all the houses in the street they look the same
Same chimney puff same little car same window panes
The neighbors call to tell you things that you should know
They say their lines they drink their tea and then they go
They tell your business in another ShangriLa
The gas bills and the water rates the payments on the car
Too scared to think about how insecure you are
Life aint so happy in your little ShangriLa
Oh ShangriLa ShangriLa
Lalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalalalaaaaaaaaaa
Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
Youve reached your top and you just cant get any higher
Youre in your place and you know where you are
In your ShangriLa
Sit back in your old rockingchair
You need not worry you need not care
You cant go anywhere
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaaaaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaa
ShangriLaaaaaaaaaaa
