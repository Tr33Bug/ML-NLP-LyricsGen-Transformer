Just sitting down by the riverside
Spreading my arms to the open wide
Now I am free and the worlds at my feet
I can close my eyes
Oh love keep me warm keep me satisfied
Please keep me calm keep me pacified
Now Im content and my life is complete
I can close my eyes
Sitting by the riverside with you
I love sitting down by the riverside
Watching the water go flowing by
Oh golly gee it is heaven to be
Like a willow tree
Spend my time just drinking wine while looking at the view
