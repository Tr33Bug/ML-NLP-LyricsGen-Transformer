Where are you going I dont mind
Ive killed my world and Ive killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I dont mind
If I live too long Im afraid Ill die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
So youve been where Ive just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
Till peace we find tell you what Ill do
All the things that I own I will share with you
And if I feel tomorrow like I feel today
Well take what we want and give the rest away
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
Cos soon I feel youre gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And if I live too long Im afraid Ill die
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
