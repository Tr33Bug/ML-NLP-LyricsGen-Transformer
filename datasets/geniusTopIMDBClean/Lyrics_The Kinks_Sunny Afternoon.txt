The tax mans taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazin on a sunny afternoon
And I cant sail my yacht
Hes taken everything Ive got
All Ive gots this sunny afternoon
Save me save me save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama tryna break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime
My girlfriends run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Tellin tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now Im sittin here
Sippin at my icecold beer
Lazin on a sunny afternoon
Help me help me help me sail away
Well give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime
Oh save me save me save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama tryna break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime
