Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ships
At your disposal if you feel so inclined
Well alright
Were gonna travel faster than light
So do up your overcoat tight
And youll go anywhere you want to decide
Well alright
Too many people
Side by side
Got no place to hide
On my supersonic rocket ship
Nobody has to be hip
Nobody needs to be out of sight  Oh out of sight man far out 
Nobodys gonna travel second class
Therell be equality
And no suppression of minorities
Well take this planet
Shake it round
And turn it upside down
On my supersonic rocket ship
It aint no magic
Aint no lie
Youll laugh so loud youll cry
Up and down
Round and round
On my supersonic rocket ship
Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ships
At your disposal if you feel so inclined
Well alright
Nobody gonna travel second class
Therell be equality
And no suppression of minorities
Well alright


Let me take you on a little trip
