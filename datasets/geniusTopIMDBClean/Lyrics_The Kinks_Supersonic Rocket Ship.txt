Supersonic Rocket Ship Lyrics[Verse 1]
Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's
At your disposal if you feel so inclined
Well alright
We're gonna travel faster than light
So do up your overcoat tight
And you'll go anywhere you want to decide
Well alright

[Verse 2]
Too many people
Side by side
Got no place to hide
[Verse 3]
On my supersonic rocket ship
Nobody has to be hip
Nobody needs to be out of sight (Oh, out of sight, man, far out)
Nobody's gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities

[Verse 4]
We'll take this planet
Shake it 'round
And turn it upside down
On my supersonic rocket ship

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 5]
It ain't no magic
Ain't no lie
You'll laugh so loud, you'll cry
Up and down
Round and round
On my supersonic rocket ship

[Verse 6]
Let me take you on a little trip
My supersonic ship's
At your disposal if you feel so inclined
Well alright
Nobody gonna travel second class
There'll be equality
And no suppression of minorities
Well alright

Let me take you on a little trip
On my supersonic rocket ship1Embed
