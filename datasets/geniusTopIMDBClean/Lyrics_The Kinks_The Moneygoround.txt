Robert owes half to Grenville
Who in turn gave half to Larry who
Adored my instrumentals
And so he gave half to a foreign publisher
He took half the money
That was earned in some far distant land
Gave back half to Larry
And I end up with half of goodness knows what
Can somebody explain
Why things go on this way
I thought they were my friends
I cant believe its me
I cant believe that Im so green
Eyes down round and round
Lets all sit and watch the moneygoround
Everyone take a little bit here and a little bit there
Do they all deserve money from a song that theyve never heard
They dont know the tune and they dont know the words
But they dont give a damn
Theres no end to it
Im in a pit and Im stuck in it
The money goes round and around and around
And it comes out here
When theyve all taken their share
I went to see a solicitor and my story was heard and the writs were served
On the verge of a nervous breakdown
I decided to fight right to the end
But if I ever get my money
Ill be too old and grey to spend it
Oh but life goes on and on
And no one ever wins
And time goes quickly by
Just like the moneygoround
I only hope that Ill survive
