This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Will we still be here watching an inflight movie show
Ill leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me I can see the world and it aint so big at all
This time tomorrow what will we see
Field full of houses endless rows of crowded streets
I dont know where Im going I dont want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me
Leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Im in perpetual motion and the world below doesnt matter much to me
This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow where will we be
This time tomorrow what will we see
This time tomorrow
