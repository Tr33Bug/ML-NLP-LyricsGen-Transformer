Tired of Waiting for You Lyrics[Chorus]
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

[Verse]
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody 'til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time, what can I do?
[Bridge]
It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

[Verse]
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody 'til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time, what can I do?

[Bridge]
It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

[Outro]
For you
For youEmbed
