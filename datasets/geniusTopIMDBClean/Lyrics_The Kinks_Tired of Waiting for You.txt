So tired tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody til I met you
But you keepa me waiting
All of the time what can I do
Its your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please dont keepa me waiting
Please dont keepa me waiting
Cause Im so tired tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
I was a lonely soul
I had nobody til I met you
But you keepa me waiting
All of the time what can I do
Its your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please dont keepa me waiting
Please dont keepa me waiting
Cause Im so tired tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
For you
For you
