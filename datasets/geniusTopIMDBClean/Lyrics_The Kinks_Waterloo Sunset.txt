Dirty old river must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright
But I dont need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunsets fine
Terry meets Julie Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy dont want to wander
I stay at home at night
But I dont feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunsets fine
Millions of people swarming like flies
Round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they dont need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise
Waterloo sunsets fine
