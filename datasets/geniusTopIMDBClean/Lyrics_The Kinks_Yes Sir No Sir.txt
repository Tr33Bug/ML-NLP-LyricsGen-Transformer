Yes Sir no Sir
Where do I go Sir
What do I do Sir
What do I say
Yes Sir no Sir
Where do I go Sir
What do I do Sir
How do I behave
Yes Sir no Sir
Permission to speak Sir
Permission to breathe Sir
What do I say how do I behave what do I say
So you think that youve got ambition
Stop your dreaming and your idle wishing
Youre outside and there aint no admission to our play
Pack up your ambition in your old kit bag
Soon youll be happy with a packet of fags
Chest out stomach in do what I say do what I say yes right away
Yes Sir no Sir
Where do I go Sir
What do I do Sir
What do I say
Yes Sir no Sir
Permission to speak Sir
Permission to breathe Sir
What do I say how do I behave what do I say
Doesnt matter who you are
Youre there and there you are
Everything is in its place authority must be maintained
And then we know exactly where we are

Let them feel that theyre important to the cause
But let them know that they are fighting for their homes
Just be sure that theyre contributing their all
Give the scum a gun and make the bugger fight
And be sure to have deserters shot on sight
If he dies well send a medal to his wife
Yes Sir no Sir
Please let me die Sir
I think this life is affecting my brain
Yes Sir no Sir
Three bags full Sir
What do I do Sir what do I say
What do I say how do I behave what do I say
