Yes Sir, No Sir Lyrics[Arthur]
Yes Sir, no Sir
Where do I go Sir?
What do I do Sir?
What do I say?

Yes Sir, no Sir?
Where do I go Sir?
What do I do Sir?
How do I behave?
Yes Sir, no Sir
Permission to speak Sir
Permission to breathe Sir
What do I say, how do I behave, what do I say?

[Aristocrats]
So you think that you've got ambition
Stop your dreaming and your idle wishing
You're outside and there ain't no admission to our play
Pack up your ambition in your old kit bag
Soon you'll be happy with a packet of fags
Chest out, stomach in, do what I say, do what I say, yes right away

[Arthur]
Yes Sir, no Sir
Where do I go Sir?
What do I do Sir?
What do I say?

Yes Sir, no Sir
Permission to speak Sir
Permission to breathe Sir
What do I say, how do I behave, what do I say?

[Aristocrats]
Doesn't matter who you are
You're there and there you are
Everything is in its place, authority must be maintained
And then we know exactly where we are
You might also likeLet them feel that they're important to the cause
But let them know that they are fighting for their homes
Just be sure that they're contributing their all
Give the scum a gun and make the bugger fight
And be sure to have deserters shot on sight
If he dies we'll send a medal to his wife

[Arthur]
Yes Sir, no Sir
Please let me die Sir
I think this life is affecting my brain
Yes Sir, no Sir
Three bags full Sir
What do I do Sir, what do I say?
What do I say, how do I behave, what do I say?Embed
