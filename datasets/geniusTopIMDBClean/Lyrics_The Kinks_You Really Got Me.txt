You Really Got Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Girl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You really got me
You really got me
You really got me
[Verse 2]
See, don't ever set me free
I always want to be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You really got me
You really got me
You really got me
(Fuck off!) Oh no!
