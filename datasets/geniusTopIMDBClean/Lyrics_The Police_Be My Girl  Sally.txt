I was blue and lonely
I couldnt sleep a wink
And I could only get unconscious
If Id had too much to drink
There was somehow
Something wrong somewhere
And each day seemed grey and dead
The seeds of desperation
Were growing in me head
I needed inspiration
A brand new start in life
Somewhere to place affection
But I didnt want a wife
And then by lucky chance I saw
In a special magazine
An ad that was unusual
The like Id never seen
Experience something different
With our new imported toy
Shes loving warm inflatable
And a guarantee of joy
She came all wrapped in cardboard
All pink and shriveled down
A breath of air was all she needed
To make her lose that frown
I took her to the bedroom
And pumped her with some life
And later in a moment
That girl became my wife
And so I sit her in the corner
And sometimes stroke her hair
And when Im feeling naughty
I blow her up with air
Shes cuddly and shes bouncy
Shes like a rubber ball
I bounce her in the kitchen
And I bounce her in the hall
And now my life is different
Since Sally came my way
I wake up in the morning
And have her on a tray
Shes everything they said she was
And I wear a permanent grin
And I only have to worry
In case my girl wears thin
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my be my be my girl
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my be my be my girl
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my be my be my girl
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my girl
Wont you be my be my be my girl
