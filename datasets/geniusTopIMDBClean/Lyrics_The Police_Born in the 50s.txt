We were born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
My mother cried when President Kennedy died
She said it was the communists but I knew better
Would they drop the bomb on us while we made love on the beach
We were the class they couldnt teach cause we knew better
We were born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
They screamed when the Beatles sang
And they laughed when the King fell down the stairs
Oh they shouldve known better
Oh we hated our aunts then we messed in our pants
Then we lost our faith and prayed to the TV
Oh we shouldve known better
We were born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
We freeze like statues on the pages of history
Living was never like this when we took all those GCEs
Oh you opened the door for us and then you turned to dust
You dont understand us so dont reprimand us
Were taking the future we dont need no teacher
We were born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
We were born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
Born born in the 50s
