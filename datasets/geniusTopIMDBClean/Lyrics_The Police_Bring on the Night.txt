The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads itself against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow its just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye
Bring on the night
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
The future is but a question mark
Hangs above my head there in the dark
Cant see for the brightness is staring me blind
As I bid yesterday goodbye
Bring on the night
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Bring on the night
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
I couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
Couldnt stand another hour of daylight
