Ive called you so many times today
And I guess its all true what your girlfriends say
That you dont ever want to see me again
And your brothers gonna kill me and hes six feet ten
I guess youd call it cowardice
But Im not prepared to go on like this
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant
I cant stand losing you
I cant stand losing you
I cant stand losing you
I cant stand losing you
I see youve sent my letters back
And my LP records and theyre all scratched
I cant see the point in another day
When nobody listens to a word I say
You can call it lack of confidence
But to carry on living doesnt make no sense
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I guess this is our last goodbye
And you dont care so I wont cry
But youll be sorry when Im dead
And all this guilt will be on your head
I guess youd call it suicide
But Im too full to swallow my pride
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand losing
I cant I cant I cant stand
Cant stand losing you
