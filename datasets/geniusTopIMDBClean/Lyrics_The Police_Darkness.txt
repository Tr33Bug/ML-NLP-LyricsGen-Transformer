I can dream up schemes when Im sitting in my seat
I dont see any flaws until I get to my feet
I wish I never woke up this morning
Life was easy when it was boring
I could make a mark if it werent so dark
I could be replaced by any bright spark
But darkness makes me fumble
For a key to a door thats wide open
Instead of worrying about my clothes
I could be someone that nobody knows
I wish I never woke up this morning
Life was easy when it was boring
I can dream up schemes when Im sitting in my seat
I dont see any flaws until I get to my feet
I wish I never woke up this morning
Life was easy when it was boring
