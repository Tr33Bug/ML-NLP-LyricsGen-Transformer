Deathwish in the fading light
Headlight pointing through the night
Never thought Id see the day
Playing with my life this way
Gotta keep my foot right down
If I had wings Id leave the ground
Burning in the outside lane
People think that Im insane
Insane
The day I take a bend too fast
Judgement that could be my last
Ill be wiped right off the slate
Dont wait up cause Ill be late
Ill be late
