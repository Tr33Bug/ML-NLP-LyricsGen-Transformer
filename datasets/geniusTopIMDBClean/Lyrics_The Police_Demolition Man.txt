Tied to the tracks and the trains just coming
Strapped to the wing with the engine running
You say that this wasnt in your plan
Dont mess around with the demolition man
Tied to a chair and the bomb is ticking
This situation was not of your picking
You say that this wasnt in your plan
Dont mess around with the demolition man
Im a walking nightmare an arsenal of doom
I can kill conversation as I walk into the room
Im a three line whip Im the sort of thing they ban
Im a walking disaster Im a demolition man
You come to me like a moth to the flame
Its love you need but I dont play that game
Because you could be my greatest fan
But Im nobodys friend Im a demolition man
Im a walking nightmare an arsenal of doom
I kill conversation as I walk into the room
Im a three line whip Im the sort of thing they ban
Im a walking disaster Im a demolition man
