I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
Im in a cold sweat I panic and it makes me late
I knew you never asked for this I know
My shots will always misfire my shots will always miss
Does everyone stare this way at you
I only look this way at you
I change my clothes ten times before I take you on a date
I get the heebiejeebies and my panic makes me late
I break into a cold sweat reaching for the phone
I let it ring twice before I chicken out and decide youre not at home
Does everyone stare the way I do
I only stare this way at you
I never noticed the size of my feet
Until I kicked you in the shins
Will you ever forgive me
For the shape Im in
For the shape Im in
Does everyone stare the way I do
I only stare this way at you
Im gonna write you a sonnet but I dont know where to start
Im so used to laughing at the things in my heart
Last of all Im sorry because you never asked for this
I can see Im not your type and my shot will always miss
Does everyone stare the way I do
I only stare this way at you
Does everyone stare the way I do
I only stare this way at you
Does everyone stare the way I do
I only stare this way at you
