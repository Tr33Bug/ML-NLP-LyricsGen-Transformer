How can you say that youre not responsible
What does it have to do with me
What is my reaction what should it be
Confronted by this latest atrocity
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Hide my face in my hands
Shame wells in my throat
My comfortable existence is reduced
To a shallow meaningless party
Seems that when some innocents die
All we can offer them is a page in a some magazine
Too many cameras and not enough food
Cause this is what weve seen
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Protest is futile
Nothing seems to get through
Whats to become of our world
Who knows what to do


Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
Driven to tears
