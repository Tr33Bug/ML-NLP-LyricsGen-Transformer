Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
Ill be watching you
Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
Ill be watching you
Oh cant you see you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
Ill be watching you
Since youve gone Ive been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but its you I cant replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby baby please
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Oh cant you see you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take
Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
Ill be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
Ill be watching you
Ill be watching you
Every breath you take 
Every move you make 
Every bond you break 
Every step you take 
Ill be watching you
Every single day 
Every word you say 
Every game you play 
Every night you stay 
Ill be watching you
Every move you make 
Every vow you break 
Every smile you fake 
Every claim you stake 
Ill be watching you
Every single day 
Every word you say 
Every game you play 
Every night you stay 
Ill be watching you
Every breath you take 
Every move you make 
Every bond you break 
Every step you take 
Ill be watching you
Every single day 
Every word you say 
Every game you play 
Every night you stay 
Ill be watching you
Every move you make 
Every vow you break 
Every smile you fake 
Every claim you stake 
Ill be watching you
Every single day 
Every word you say 
Every game you play 
Every night you stay 
Ill be watching you
