Though Ive tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve as Ive done from the start
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
Its a big enough umbrella
But its always me that ends up getting wet
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if shell marry me
In some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on


Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
Every little thing every little thing
Every every little thing
Every little every little every little
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
Every little thing she does
That she does is magic
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Eee oh oh eee oh oh
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
She does is magic magic magic
Magic magic magic
Ey oh yo oh
Eee oh oh oh oh oh
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
Its a big enough umbrella
But its always me
That ends up getting wet
