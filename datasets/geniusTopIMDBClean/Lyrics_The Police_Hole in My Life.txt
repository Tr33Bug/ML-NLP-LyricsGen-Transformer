Yeah yeah

Yeah yeah
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Shadow in my heart
Is tearing me apart
Or maybe its just something
In my stars
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Be a happy man
I try the best I can
Or maybe Im just looking
For too much
Theres something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Theres something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please
Oh theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
Theres a hole in my life
