Wake up make up bring it up shake up
Stand by dont cry watching while the world dies
Big car movie star hot tip go far
Blind date too late take a bus dont wait
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
For you and you and you
Limp wrist tight fist contract no twist
Black dress no mess people want no less no less
Stand by dont cry watching while the world dies
Three lane fast plane standing in the cold rain
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
For you
Headlight high life cant sleep good night
Up tight big fight big deal too right too right
Big town dont drown jump back turn around
No life flick knife finish off my life
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
For you and you and you and you and you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
Its alright for you
For you
