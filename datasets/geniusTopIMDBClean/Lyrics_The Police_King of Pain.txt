Theres a little black spot on the sun today
Its the same old thing as yesterday
Theres a black hat caught in a high tree top
Theres a flag pole rag and the wind wont stop
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running round my brain
I guess Im always hoping that youll end this reign
But its my destiny to be the king of pain
Theres a little black spot on the sun today
Thats my soul up there 
Its the same old thing as yesterday
Thats my soul up there 
Theres a black hat caught in a high treetop
Thats my soul up there 
Theres a flag pole rag and the wind wont stop
Thats my soul up there 
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running round my brain
I guess Im always hoping that youll end this reign
But its my destiny to be the king of pain
Theres a fossil thats trapped in a high cliff wall
Thats my soul up there 
Theres a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall
Thats my soul up there 
Theres a blue whale beached by a spring tides ebb
Thats my soul up there 
Theres a butterfly trapped in a spiders web
Thats my soul up there 
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running round my brain
I guess Im always hoping that youll end this reign
But its my destiny to be the king of pain
Theres a king on a throne with his eyes torn out
Theres a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt
Theres a rich man sleeping on a golden bed
Theres a skeleton choking on a crust of bread
King of pain 
Theres a red fox torn by a huntsmans pack
Thats my soul up there 
Theres a blackwinged gull with a broken back
Thats my soul up there 
Theres a little black spot on the sun today
Its the same old thing as yesterday
I have stood here before inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles running round my brain
I guess Im always hoping that youll end this reign
But its my destiny to be the king of pain
King of pain king of pain
King of pain Ill always be
King of pain Ill always be
King of pain Ill always be
King of pain Ill always be
King of pain Ill always be
King of pain Ill always be
King of pain Ill always be
King of pain
