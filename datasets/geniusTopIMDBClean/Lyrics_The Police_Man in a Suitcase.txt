Id invite you back to my place
Its only mine because it holds my suitcase
It looks like home to me alright
But its a hundred miles from yesterday night
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
Another key for my collection
For security I race for my connection
Bird in a flying cage youll never get to know me well
The worlds my oyster my hotel rooms a prison cell
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
Id invite you back to my place
Its only mine because it holds my suitcase
It looks like home to me alright
But its a hundred miles from yesterday night
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
Must I be the man in a suitcase
Is it me the man with the strangers face
