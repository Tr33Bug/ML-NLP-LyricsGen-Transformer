Just a castaway an island lost at sea oh
Another lonely day with no one here but me oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair oh
Ill send an SOS to the world
Ill send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle  Yeah 
Message in a bottle  Yeah 
A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life but love can break your heart
Ill send an SOS to the world
Ill send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle  Yeah 
Message in a bottle  Yeah 
Oh  Message in a bottle  Yeah 
Message in a bottle  Yeah 
Walked out this morning dont believe what I saw
Hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore
Seems Im not alone at being alone
Hundred billion castaways looking for a home
Ill send an SOS to the world
Ill send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle  Yeah 
Message in a bottle  Yeah 
Message in a bottle  Oh
