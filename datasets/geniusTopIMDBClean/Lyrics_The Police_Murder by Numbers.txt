Once that youve decided on a killing
First you make a stone of your heart
And if you find that your hands are still willing
Then you can turn a murder into art

You just do it with a little more finesse
If you can slip a tablet into someones coffee
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess
Because its murder by numbers 1 2 3
Its as easy to learn as your ABC
Its murder by numbers 1 2 3
Its as easy to learn as your ABC
Now if you have a taste for this experience
And youre flushed with your very first success
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
And youll find your conscience bothers you much less
Because murder is like anything you take to
Its a habitforming need for more and more
You can bump off every member of your family
And anybody else you find a bore
Because its murder by numbers 1 2 3

Its murder by numbers 1 2 3

Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious
In historys great dark hall of fame
All our greatest killers were industrious
At least the ones that we all know by name


But you can reach the top of your profession
If you become the leader of the land
For murder is the sport of the elected
And you dont need to lift a finger of your hand
