I cant stand it for another day
When you live so many miles away
Nothing here is gonna make me stay
You took me over let me find a way
I sold my house I sold my motor too
All I want is to be next to you
Id rob a bank maybe steal a plane
You took me over think Im going insane
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
Ive had a thousand girls or maybe more
But Ive never felt like this before
But I just dont know whats come over me
You took me over take a look at me
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
So many times I used to give a sign
Got this feeling gonna lose my mind
When all it is is just a love affair
You took me over baby take me there
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
What can I do
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
All I want is to be next to you
