Everyone I know is lonely
And God is so far away
And my heart belongs to no one
So now sometimes I pray
Take the space between us
And fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up
Fill it up
Oh my God You take the biscuit
Treating me this way
Expecting me to treat You well
No matter what You say
How can I turn the other cheek
Its black and bruised and torn
Ive been waiting
Since the day that I was born
Fill it up
Fill it up
Fill it up
Take the space between us
Fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up fill it up
Fill it up fill it up
Fill it up fill it up
The fat man in his garden
The thin man at his gate
My God You must be sleeping
Wake up its much too late


Take the space between us
Fill it up some way
Take the space between us
Fill it up fill it up
Fill it up fill it up
Fill it up fill it up
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days
Since we first met
Its a big enough umbrella
But its always me
That ends up getting wet
