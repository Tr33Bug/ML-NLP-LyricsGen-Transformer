The other ones are complete bullshit
You want something corny
You got it
Theres a house on my street and it looks real neat
Im the chap who lives in it
Theres a tree on the sidewalk theres a car by the door
Ill go for a drive in it
And when the wombat comes he will find me gone
Hell look for a place to sit
My wife has burned the scrambled eggs
The dog just bit my leg
My teenage daughter ran away
My fine young son has turned out gay
Cut off my fingers in the door of my car
How could I do it
My wife is proud to tell me of her love affairs
How could she do this to me
My wife has burned the scrambled eggs
The dog just bit my leg
My teenage daughter ran away
My fine young son has turned out gay
And it would be okay on any other day
And it would be okay on any other day
Throw down the morning papers and spill my tea
I dont know whats wrong with me
The cups and plates are in a conspiracy
Im covered in misery
My wife has burned the scrambled eggs
The dog just bit my leg
My teenage daughter ran away
My fine young son has turned out gay
And it would be okay on any other day
Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you 
And it would be okay on any other day
Happy birthday dear daddy happy birthday to you
