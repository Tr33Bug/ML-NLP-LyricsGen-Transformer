Its all a game
Youre not the same
Your famous name
The price of fame
Oh no try to liberate me
I said oh no stay and irritate me
I said oh no try to elevate me
I said oh no just a fallen hero
Dont wanna hear about the drugs youre taking
Dont wanna read about the love youre making
Dont wanna hear about the life youre faking
Dont wanna read about the muck theyre raking
You sang your song
For much too long
Theres something wrong
Your brain has gone
Oh no try to liberate me
I said oh no stay and irritate me
I said oh no try to elevate me
I said oh no just a fallen hero
Dont wanna hear about the drugs youre taking
Dont wanna read about the love youre making
Dont wanna hear about the life youre faking
Dont wanna read about the muck theyre raking
Its all a game
Youre not the same
Your famous name
The price of fame


Oh no try to liberate me
I said oh no stay and irritate me
I said oh no try to elevate me
I said oh no just a fallen hero
Dont wanna hear about the drugs youre taking
Dont wanna read about the love youre making
Dont wanna hear about the life youre faking
Dont wanna read about the muck theyre raking
Dont wanna hear about the drugs youre taking
Dont wanna read about the love youre making
Dont wanna hear about the life youre faking
Dont wanna read about the muck theyre raking
Dont wanna hear about the drugs youre taking
Dont wanna read about the love youre making
Dont wanna hear about the life youre faking
Dont wanna read about the muck theyre raking
Dont wanna hear about the drugs youre taking
Dont wanna read about the love youre making
Dont wanna hear about the life youre faking
Dont wanna read about the muck theyre raking
