He goes out at night with his big boots on
None of his friends know right from wrong
They kick a boy to death cause he dont belong
Youve got to humanise yourself
A policeman put on his uniform
Hed like to have a gun just to keep him warm
Because violence here is a social norm
Youve got to humanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
I work all day at the factory
Im building a machine thats not for me
There must be a reason that I cant see
Youve got to humanise yourself
Billys joined the National Front
He always was a little runt
Hes got his hand in the air with the other cunts
Youve got to humanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
Rehumanise yourself
I work all day at the factory
Im building a machine thats not for me
There must be a reason that I cant see
Youve got to humanise yourself
