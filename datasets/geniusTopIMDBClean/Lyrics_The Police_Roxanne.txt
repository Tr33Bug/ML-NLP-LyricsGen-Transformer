Roxanne
You dont have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You dont have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You dont have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You dont care if its wrong or if its right
Roxanne
You dont have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You dont have to put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light oh
I loved you since I knew you
I wouldnt talk down to ya
I have to tell you just how I feel
I wont share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your makeup
Told you once
I wont tell you again its a bad way
Roxanne
You dont have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You dont have to put on the red light
Roxanne  You dont have
To put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  You dont have
To put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
Roxanne  Put on the red light
