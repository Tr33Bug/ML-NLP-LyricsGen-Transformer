Well someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just dont care
You look as if youre going somewhere
But I just cant convince myself
I couldnt live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
Now no ones knocked upon my door
For a thousand years or more
All made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this oneman show
Just take a seat theyre always free
No surprise no mystery
In this theatre that I call my soul
I always play the starring role
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
So lonely
Lonely Im so lonely
I feel so alone
I feel low
I feel so
Feel so low
I feel low low
I feel low low low
I feel low low low
I feel low low low
I feel low low low
I feel low low low
Low I feel low
I feel low
I feel low
I feel so lonely
I feel so lonely
I feel so lonely lonely lonely lone
Lone lone lone
I feel so lonely


So lonely  I feel so alone 
So lonely  I feel so alone 
So lonely  I feel so lonely 
So lonely  I feel so alone 
So lonely  I feel so alone 
So lonely  I feel so lonely 
So lonely  I feel so alone 
So lonely  I feel so alone
