There is no political solution
To our troubled evolution
Have no faith in constitution
There is no bloody revolution
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
Our socalled leaders speak
With words they try to jail you
They subjugate the meek
But its the rhetoric of failure
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
Where does the answer lie
Living from day to day
If its something we cant buy
There must be another way
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
