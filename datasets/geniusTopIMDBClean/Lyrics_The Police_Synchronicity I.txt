With one breath with one flow
You will know synchronicity
A sleep trance a dream dance
A shared romance synchronicity
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
If we share this nightmare
We can dream spiritus mundi
If you act as you think
The missing link synchronicity
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible
Oh
We know you they know me
Extrasensory synchronicity
A star fall a phone call
It joins all synchronicity
A connecting principle
Linked to the invisible
Almost imperceptible
Something inexpressible
Science insusceptible
Logic so inflexible
Causally connectable
Nothing is invincible


Its so deep its so wide
Youre inside synchronicity
Effect without a cause
Subatomic laws
Scientific pause
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity
Synchronicity oh
