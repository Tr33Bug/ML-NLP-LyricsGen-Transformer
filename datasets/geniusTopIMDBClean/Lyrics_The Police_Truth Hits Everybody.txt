Sleep lay behind me like a broken ocean
Strange waking dreams before my eyes unfold
You lay there sleeping like an open doorway
I stepped outside myself and felt so cold
Take a look at my new toy
Itll blow your head in two oh boy
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
Oh oh oh
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
I thought about it and my dream was broken
I clutch at images like dying breath
And I dont want to make a fuss about it
The only certain thing in life is death
Take a look at my new toy
Itll blow your head in two oh boy
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
Oh oh oh
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
Where you want to be
Wont you ever see
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
Oh oh oh
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
Truth hits everybody
Truth hits everyone
