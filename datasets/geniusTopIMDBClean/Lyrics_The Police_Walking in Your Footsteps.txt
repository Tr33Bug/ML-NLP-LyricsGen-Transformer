Fifty million years ago
You walked upon the planet so
Lord of all that you could see
Just a little bit like me
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Hey Mr Dinosaur
You really couldnt ask for more
You were Gods favorite creature
But you didnt have a future
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Hey mighty brontosaurus
Dont you have a lesson for us
You thought your rule would always last
There were no lessons in your past
You were built three stories high
They say you would not hurt a fly
If we explode the atom bomb
Would they say that we were dumb
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps


They say the meek
Shall inherit the earth
They say the meek
Shall inherit the earth
Walking in your footsteps footsteps footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps footsteps footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
Walking in your footsteps
