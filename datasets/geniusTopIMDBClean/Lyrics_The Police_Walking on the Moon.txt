Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs dont break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could be together
Walking on walking on the moon
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Feet they hardly touch the ground
Walking on the moon
My feet dont hardly make no sound
Walking on walking on the moon
Some may say Im wishing my days away
No way and if its the price I pay
Some say tomorrows another day
You stay I may as well play
Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hope my legs dont break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon
We could be together
Walking on walking on the moon
Some may say Im wishing my days away
No way and if its the price I pay
Some say tomorrows another day
You stay I may as well play
Keep it up keep it up
Keep it up keep it up
Keep it up keep it up
Keep it up keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
Keep it up keep it up
Yo yo yo yo
