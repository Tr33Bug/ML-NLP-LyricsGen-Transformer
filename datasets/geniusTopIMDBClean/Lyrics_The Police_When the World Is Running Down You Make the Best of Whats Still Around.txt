Turn on my VCR
Same one Ive had for years
James Brown on the TAMI show
Same tape Ive had for years
I sit in my old car
Same one Ive had for years
Old batterys running down
It ran for years and years
Turn on the radio the static hurts my ears
Tell me where would I go
I aint been out in years
Turn on the stereo
Its played for years and years
An Otis Redding song its all I own
When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
Plug in my MCI
To exercise my brain
Make records on my own
Cant go out in the rain
Pick up the telephone
Ive listened here for years
No one to talk to me
Ive listened here for years
When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
When I feel lonely here
Dont waste my time with tears
I run Deep Throat again
It ran for years and years
Dont like the food I eat
The cans are running out
Same food for years and years
I hate the food I eat


When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of whats still around
Turn on my VCR
Same one Ive had for years
James Brown on the TAMI show
Same tape Ive had for years
I sit in my old car
Same one Ive had for years
