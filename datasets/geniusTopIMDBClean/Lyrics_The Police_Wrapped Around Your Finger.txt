You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turn into a shining band of gold
Ill be wrapped around your finger
Ill be wrapped around your finger
Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what youre up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition
Ill be wrapped around your finger
Ill be wrapped around your finger
Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air youll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master
Oh youll be wrapped around my finger
Youll be wrapped around my finger
Youll be wrapped around my finger
Ohh
