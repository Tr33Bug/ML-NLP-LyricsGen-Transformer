megaman Lyrics
The night came down jungle sounds were in my ears
City screams are all Ive heard in twenty years
The razor edge of night it cuts into my sleep
I sit upon the edge now shall I make that leap
Im the Omegaman
Im the Omegaman
The skys alive with turned on television sets
I walk the streets and seek another vision yet
The echo makes me turn to see that last frontier
The edge of time closes down as I disappear
Im the Omegaman
Im the Omegaman
Im the Omegaman
Im the Omegaman
Always talking to myself
The time thats best is when surroundings fade away
The presence of another world comes close to me
Its time for me to throw away this paper knife
Im not alone in reaching for a perfect life
Im the Omegaman
Im the Omegaman
Im so tired of the Omegaman
Im so tired of the Omegaman
Im so tired of the Omegaman
Im so tired of the Omegaman
Im so tired of the Omegaman
Im so tired of the Omegaman
Im so tired of the Omegaman
