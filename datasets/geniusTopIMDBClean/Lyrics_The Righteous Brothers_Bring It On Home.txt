If you ever change your mind
About leaving leaving me behind
Ohoh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
Ohoh bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Ill give you jewellery and money too
That aint all that aint all Ill do for you
Oh if you bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
You know Ill always be your slave
Til Im buried buried in my grave
Oh honey bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
One more thing
I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out stayed out at night
But I forgive you bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
