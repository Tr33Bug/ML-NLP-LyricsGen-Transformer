When your lips long to be kissed
And your heart cries for love that you have missed
Bring your love to me
Darling please dont you be a prude
No dont go to him  Dont go to him 
Bring your love to me  Bring your love to me 
Just to feel your lips next to mine once more
Would be just what my hearts been crying for
So please take my hand
Darling please walk away with me
Please dont go to him  Dont go to him 
Bring your love to me  Bring your love to me 
When youre in his arms
I can feel my heart crying
When he takes your hand
I can feel my soul dying
How could I be so blind
To lose a love that was only mine
All the stories that I heard were wrong
Without your love I cant go on
So bring your love to me
Darling please dont you be a prude
No dont go to him  Dont go to him 
Bring your love to me  Bring your love 
Oh bring your love  Bring your love 
Please bring your love  Bring your love 
I got to have your love  Bring your love 
To me
