Lay your head down on my shoulder
I wont let the night get colder
Ill protect you
Ill be keepin trouble far from where your sleepin
Until you wake in the mornin 
Youve got the world to yourself
Dream on
Dream about the world were gonna live in one fine day
Dream on
Spend the night in heaven Ill be here to light your way
Someday tomorrow will smile
But little girl in the meanwhile
Dream on
Youre a princess Chains around you
Im a hero who just found you
Til a brand new day must wake you
Let imagination take you
Go where the music is playin
Ill be along in a while
Baby baby Dream on
Dream about the world were gonna live in one fine day
Dream on
Spend the night in heaven Ill be here to light your way
Dream on
Dream on
