First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more
So Ill rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide
At last were face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell I can feel you are love
You are really mine in the rain in the dark in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
Im at peace in the web of your arms
Ebb tide
