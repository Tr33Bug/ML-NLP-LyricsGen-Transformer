I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
Ill give you my heart
I love you and you alone were meant for me
Please give your loving heart to me
And say well never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling Im never lonely
Whenever you are in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
Ive given you my heart
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
Ive given you my heart
