Georgia oh Georgia
No peace I find
Its just a song sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind on my mind
Georgia oh Georgia
A song a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
Oh as the moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes they smile so tenderly
But still in peaceful peaceful dreams I see
That the road leads back to you
Yeah I said Georgia
Yeah yeah Georgia
Yeah no peace no peace I find
Oh a sweet song that keeps Georgia on my mind
Yeah on my mind
Yeah just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Yeah on my mind
