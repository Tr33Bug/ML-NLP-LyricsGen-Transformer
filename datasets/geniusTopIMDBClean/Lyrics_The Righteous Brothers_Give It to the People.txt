Ever since the time that I was ten years old
I dream about the way it would be
Mama had me playing on that classical piano
But that was not the music for me
I had my very first introduction
By singing in a local band
Ive got my rock and my roll instruction
Playing every club in the land
I made a deal with the angel of music
And I found what you said was true
If you give it to the people like the people want it
Theyll give it theyll give it
Theyll give it right back to you
I cant think of anything that I wouldnt do
As long as someone wants me to sing
You dont have to label me a Hollywood hero
Just let me do my righteous thing
Cos when the crowd theyre just waiting for you
And the lights they checkout okay
There aint no words to describe the feeling
That everybodys come to hear you play
Yes I will 
I made a deal with the angel of music
And I learned what its all about
If you give it to the people like they wanna hear it
Theyll let it theyll let it
Theyll let it all hang all night
You know I you know I made a deal with the angel of music
And I found what she said it was true
If you give it to the people like the people wanted
Theyll give it theyll give it
Theyll give it right back to you
I made a deal with the angel of music
And I learned what its all about
If you give it to the people like they wanna hear it
