Love can change a young boy into a man
But a broken heart can change a man back into a boy again
Youre not the first man to cry when things have gone wrong
Youre only human youre only so strong
It takes more than a tear to knock a big man down
It takes more broken hearts to keep him down on the ground
It takes three little words to make him stand again
So cry
Go ahead and cry cry
Love is so easy to play but so hard to read
Youre still a young man your heart will love again
It takes more little kiss from her sweet tender lips
It takes more gentle touch from her soft finger tips
It takes more than one tear to mend a broken heart
So cry
Go ahead and cry cry
Go ahead and cry
Dont be ashamed to cry cry
