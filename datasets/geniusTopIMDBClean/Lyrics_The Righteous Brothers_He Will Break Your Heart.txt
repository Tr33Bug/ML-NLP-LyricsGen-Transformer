He dont love you like I love you
If he did he wouldnt break your heart
He dont love you like I love you
Hes trying to tear us apart
Fare thee well I know youre leaving
For the new love youve found
That handsome guy that youve been dating
Whoa Ive got a feeling hes going to put you down
He dont love you like I love you
If he did he wouldnt break your heart
He dont love you like I love you
Hes trying to tear us apart
Now he uses all the great quotations
He says all the things Id love to say
But hes had so many rehearsals
To him its just another play
But wait and when the final act is over
And youre left standing all alone
When he takes his bow and makes his exit
Ill be there to take you home
He dont love you
