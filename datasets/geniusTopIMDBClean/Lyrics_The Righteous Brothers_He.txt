He can turn the tides and calm the angry sea
He alone decides who writes a symphony
He lights every star that makes the darkness bright
He keeps watch all through each long and lonely night
He still finds the time to hear a childs first prayer
Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live
Hell always say I forgive
He can touch a tree and turn the leaves to gold
He knows every lie that you and I have told
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live
Hell always say I forgive
