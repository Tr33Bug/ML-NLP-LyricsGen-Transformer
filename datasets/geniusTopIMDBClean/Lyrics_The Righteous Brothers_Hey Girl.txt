Hey Girl I want you to know
Im gonna miss you so much if you go
And Hey Girl I tell you no lie
Something deep inside of mes going to die
If you say so long if this is goodbye Oh
Hey Girl This cant be true
How am I supposed to exist without you
And Hey Girl Now dont put me on
Whats gonna happen to me when youre gone
How will I live How can I go on
How can I go on Hey Girl
Hey Girl Now sit yourself down
Im not ashamed to get down on the ground
Dont go away Hey Girl
Dont go away Hey Girl
