Girl you got me to fall in love with you
Though Im not free to fall in love with you
Oh baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
Tell me
Why did I have to get so hung on you
Believe me baby
I didnt plan it this way
I thought Id see you one night and
Forget you the next day
Youre not the girl that I belong to
And even though I know its wrong to
Theres a little place where we can go
Where we wont run into a soul we know
Whoa baby baby
Well I wish I could get you out of my heart
Then I could also get you out of my life
Baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
Tell me
Why did I have to get so hung on you
Sure I could tell you its over and then
One day Id call you and beg you to see me again
This is a fine mess I got myself in
And let me tell you baby youre not helping
You know the changes Im going through
And still you look at me the way you do
Cause you got me to fall in love with you
Though Im not free to fall in love with you
Baby baby
Why did I have to get so hung on you
I want to know
Why did I have to get so hung on you
