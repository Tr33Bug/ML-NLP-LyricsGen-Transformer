I believe in the power and I never ever doubt
Evry minute evry hour I believe
I believe in myself cause I know
I get my help from the power in the sky
I believe
No need askin where Ive been just ask me where Im goin
I wont be ashamed to tell ya I live my life knowin
All the roads ahead of me are filled with peace and love
Evry step so heavenly ya fall and bounce right up
All miracles and dreams realize for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible now if you believe
I believe in the power and I never ever doubt
Evry minute evry hour I believe
I believe in myself cause I know
I get my help from the power in the sky
I believe
Lookin in the mirror I can see my eyes are glowin
Living testimony that the spirits in me flowin
Oh Im feelin so good got to raise my hands and rejoice
Say a few words to praise him evrytime I lift my voice
All miracles and dreams realize for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible now if you believe
I believe in the power and I never ever doubt
Evry minute evry hour I believe
I believe in myself cause I know
I get my help from the power in the sky
