Now you know me
And you know how proud I am
And what Im gonna tell you now
Wont be easy to say
Before I left you
I was a happy man
But Ive been so lonely
Since youve been away
And girl Ive tried and I know I cant make it alone
Its such a hard way to go I just cant make it alone
Theres something in my soul
That will always lead me back to you
What can I say now
Being sorry is just not good enough
I wouldnt blame you if you hurt me now
The way I hurt you then
But who else can I turn to
Baby Im begging you
Please reach out to a dying man
And let him live again
Cause girl Ive tried and I know I cant make it alone
Its such a hard way to go I just cant make it alone
Theres something in my soul
That will always lead me back to you
Help me girl I need you
Please help me
