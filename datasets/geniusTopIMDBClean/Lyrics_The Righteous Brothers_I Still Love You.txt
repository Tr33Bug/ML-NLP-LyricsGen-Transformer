When somebody puts you down
And your hearts gets kicked around
Every time you love and lose
You run to me with your bad news
I dont wanna see you cry anymore
I dont wanna see the tears in your eyes anymore
It hurts me to see your heart so broken up
Cause I I still love you  I still love you 
I still need you  I still need you 
And I still want you  I still want you 
Cause youre my baby  I still love you 
When your new loves tired of you
And you dont know what to do
Thats when you come back to me
But my baby cant you see
I dont wanna see you cry anymore
I dont wanna see the tears in your eyes anymore
It hurts me to see your heart so broken up
Cause I I still love you  I still love you 
I still need you  I still need you 
And I still want you  I still want you 
Cause youre my baby  I still love you 
Cause I still love you  I still love you 
Honey I need you  I still need you 
And I still want you  I still want you 
Cause youre my baby  I still love you 
Woah I still want you pretty baby  I still love you 
Honey I need you  I still need you 
And I still love you
