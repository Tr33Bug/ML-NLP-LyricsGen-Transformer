Im leavin it all up to youoohooh
You decide what youre gonna do
Now do you want my looove
Or are we through
Thats why Im leaving it up to youoohooh
You decide what youre gonna do
Now do you want my looove
Or are we through
Ive got my heart in my hand
II dont understand
Baby what what have I done wrong
You know I worship the ground that you walk on
Thats why Im leavin it up to youoohooh
You decide what youre gonna do
Now do you want my looove
Or are we through
