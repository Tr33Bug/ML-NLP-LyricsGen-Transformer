I need
I need your heart to want me
I need your lips to kiss me
I need your love
Im so lonely lonely lonely
I want I want each tear you cry
I want each tear to weep on me
I want your love
Im so lonely ohoh so lonely
A heart would break inside if you turn your back on me
Now that you know my love is gone
So look at my life and then make up your mind
And Ill never never let you gooo
I pray
Ohohohoh
That you will be my love
So hear my prayer
I need your love
Im so lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely lonely
Im so lonely Im so lonely
Let me tell you now Im so lonely
So lonely Im so lonely baby
What can I do Tell me now what can I do
Ohohohoh
