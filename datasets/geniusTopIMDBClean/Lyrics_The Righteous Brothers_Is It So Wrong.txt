Do you see do you care
Do you even notice Im there
The road goes on to the end
And youre the friend of a friend
So we meet and we smile
And inside Im only a child
But lies have lost their appeal
My eyes betrayed what I feel
Ive been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone wholl never be mine
Ive been hoping so long you would want me one day
Perhaps this time around youd just might
But is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so right
Do you see and do you know
If you do you dont let it show
The world is on all around
And I can always be found
So I walk and I ran
And I prayed it isnt too late
For who knows better than I
If time is passing me by
Ive been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone wholl never be mine
Ive been hoping so long you would want me one day
But I never once believed you really would
And is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so good
Tell me is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so good
