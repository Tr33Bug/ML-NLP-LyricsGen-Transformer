This is my island in the sun
Where my people have toiled since time begun
I may sail on many a sea
Her shores will always be home to me
Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my fathers hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest waters your shining sand
When morning breaks the heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below
Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my fathers hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest waters your shining sand
I see woman on bended knee
Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the water side
Casting nets at the surging tide
Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my fathers hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest waters your shining sand
I hope the day will never come
That I cant awake to the sound of drum
Never let me miss carnival
With calypso songs philosophical
Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my fathers hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest waters your shining sand
Sad the time Ill ever miss
The gay colored skirts as they turn and twist
Let me always hear soft guitars
And a maidens voice neath a thousand stars

Oh island in the sun
Willed to me by my fathers hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest waters your shining sand
