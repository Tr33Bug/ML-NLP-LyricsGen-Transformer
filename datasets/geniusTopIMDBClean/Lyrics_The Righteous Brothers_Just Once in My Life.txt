Theres a lot of things I want
A lot of things that Id like to be
But girl I dont forsee a rags to riches story for me
Its just one little thing I got to make come true
Its just one round Ive got to win
I cant be a loser with you
Baby baby just once in my life
Im gonna get what I want girl dont let me down
Just once in my life let me hold on to
The good thing I found dont let me down
Baby say that youd be staying
Cause I couldnt face the day if you werent here by my side
And if you went away then Id be left without any pride
Ive given up on schemes cause everyone fell through
Ive given up so many things dont ask me to give up on you
And baby baby just once in my life
Im gonna get what I want girl dont let me down
Just once in my life
Let me hold on to the good thing I found dont let me down
Baby say that youd be staying
That old pot of gold aint so easy to find
But if youll stand by me
Girl Ill keep peace of mind
I cant give you the world
But Ill work hard for you girl
Ill work hard everyday all my life
If youll say you wont leave me
Baby dont leave me
Please dont leave me
Baby dont leave me
Just do this for me baby
Once in my life let me get what I want
Girl dont let me down
Just once in my life let me hold onto a good thing Ive found dont
Let me down
Baby say that youll be stayin Mmmm
Oh yeah Mmmm
Just once in my life let me get what I want
Girl dont let me down
Just once in my life let me hold onto
A good thing Ive found dont let me down  fade
