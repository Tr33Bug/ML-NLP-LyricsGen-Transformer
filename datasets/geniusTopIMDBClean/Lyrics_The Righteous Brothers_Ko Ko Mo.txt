Talk to me baby
Whisper in my ear
Talk to me baby
Whisper in my ear
Come a little closer
Dont have no fear
Heard what you told me
Heard what you said
Heard what you told me
Heard what you said
Dont worry my pretty
Wont lose my head
Dont you know
That I love you so
Well dont you know
That I love you so
When I holler hey hey hey hey hey hey
Ko ko mo
Dimples on her elbows
Dimples on her knees
Dimples on her elbows
Dimples on her knees
She thrills and thrills me
With just a little squeeze
Dont you know
That I love you so
Well dont you know
That I love you so
When I holler hey hey hey hey hey hey
Ko ko mo
Ko ko a ko ko mo
Ko ko a ko ko mo
Ko ko a ko ko mo
Ko ko a ko ko mo
Hey hey hey hey hey hey
A ko ko mo
