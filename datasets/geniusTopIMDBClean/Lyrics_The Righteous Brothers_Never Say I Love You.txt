Hey baby are you sleeping
Theres something I think we oughta talk about
I cant put my finger on it but honey
I know theres something wrong
Its the same hello you gave me
When I came home tonight
Your kiss was warm and tender
And the same arms held me tight
Now you laying right here beside me
Something that you always do
Oh it isnt what you say thats been givin you away
I just know that Im losing you
You can tell me that you need me
That youre feeling it deep inside
You can go through all the motions
Of a woman whos satisfied
Spend your life pretending
Its as good as it was before
But you never say I love you anymore
Were a pretty good combination
In everybody elses eyes
They see us both together
Only we know the truth only we know the lie
You can tell me that you need me
That youre feeling it deep inside
You can go through all the motions
Of a woman whos satisfied
Spend spend your life pretending
Its as good as it was before
But you never say I love you
I love you anymore
You can tell me that you need me
That youre feeling it deep inside
You can go through all the motions
Of a woman whos satisfied
You can tell me that you need me
That youre feeling it deep inside
You can go through all the motions
Of a woman whos satisfied
