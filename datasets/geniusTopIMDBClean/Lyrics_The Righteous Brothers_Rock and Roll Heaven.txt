If you believe in forever
Then life is just a onenight stand
If theres a rock n roll heaven
Well you know theyve got a hell of a band band band
Jimi gave us rainbows
And Janis took a piece of our hearts
And Otis brought us all to the dock of a bay
Sing a song to light my fire remember Jim that way
Theyve all found another place another place to play
If you believe in forever
Then life is just a onenight stand
If theres a rock n roll heaven
Well you know theyve got a hell of a band band band
Remember bad bad Leroy Brown hey
Jimmy touched us with that song
Time wont change a friend we came to know
And Bobby gave us Mack the Knife
Well look out hes back in town
Theyll all be there together
When they meet in one big show
If you believe in forever
Then life is just a onenight stand
If theres a rock n roll heaven
Well you know theyve got a hell of a band band band
Theres a spotlight waiting
No matter who you are
Cause everybodys got a song to sing
Everyones a star
Everybodys got to be a star 
If you believe in forever
Then life is just a onenight stand
If theres a rock n roll heaven
Well you know theyve got a hell of a band band band
