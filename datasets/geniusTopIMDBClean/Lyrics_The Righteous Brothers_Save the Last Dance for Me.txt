You can dance
Evry dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Evry smile for the man who held your hand
Neath the pale moonlight
But dont forget whos taking you home
And in whose arms youre gonna be
So darlin save the last dance for me mmmm
Oh I know  oh I know 
That the musics fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while were apart
Dont give your heart to anyone
But dont forget whos taking you home
And in whose arms youre gonna be
So darlin save the last dance for me mmmm
Baby dont you know
I love you so
Cant you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
I love you oh so much
You can dance  you can dance 
Go and carry on
Til the night is gone
And its time to go
If he asks if youre all alone
Can he take you home you must tell him no
Cause dont forget whos taking you home
And in whose arms youre gonna be
So darlin save the last dance for me

Cause dont forget whos taking you home
And in whose arms your gonna be
So darlin save the last dance for me mmmm
Save the last dance for me mmmmhmmmm
Save the last dance for me mmmm
