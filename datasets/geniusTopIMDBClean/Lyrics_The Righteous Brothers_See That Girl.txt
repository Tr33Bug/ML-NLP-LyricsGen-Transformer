See that girl
Look at her good
Thats something you dont
See every day now
Dig those eyes
Aint they a prize
They sure can get to you
And hey now
Look at that crazy smile
I bet you cant believe
She was mine for a while
Aint she somethin
See that guy
Right by her side
Hes feelin proud and
Dont he show it
Look and see
That could have been me
Would you believe Id go
And blow it
I let her slip away
And I tell myself Im okay
But it just tears the
Heart out of me
When I see that girl
When I see that girl
break 
I let her slip away
And I tell myself Im okay
But it just tears the
Heart out of me
When I see that girl
When I see that girl
When I see that girl
