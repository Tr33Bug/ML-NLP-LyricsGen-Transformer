There she goes
Walking with him
Wearing the smile she wore
When she used to be mine
But I know that shell
Come to my side
The minute he
Tells her goodbye
But my heart wont let me forget
That Im just a standby
For when hes gone
Even though I know its wrong
I can pretend
That her love is mine
I can pretend she is there
All the time
But it breaks my heart
To know that Im
Not her man
Im just a standby
I know Im a fool
But I dont care
My heart grows so cold when shes gone
But so warm when shes there
Id rather be a fool
And share her love
Than to be a man
Whos not involved at all
So I will pretend
That her love is mine
I can pretend she is there
All the time
But it breaks my heart
To know that Im
Not her man
Im just a standby
