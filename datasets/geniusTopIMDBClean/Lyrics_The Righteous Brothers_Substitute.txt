Say
Youve been waiting much too long now
Dont know when shes coming home
Say now
Youve been loyal true and faithful
All this time of being alone
If I could get that same dedication
Id give you everything in creation
If she doesnt come back  come back   come back 
Ooh Ill be your substitute whenever you want me
Oh dont you know Id be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
Send my love and admiration straight to you 
Say  Say 
Everyday you waited for her Ive been waiting here for you
Say  Say 
All this time Ive been lonely knowing what youre going through
I waited til my chances occured cause you cant keep relying on her
If she doesnt come back  if she doesnt come back 
Ill be your substitute whenever you want me  ooh ooh 
Oh dont you know Id be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
Each day by your window  you sit and sigh  hoping to see her face
Well you might as well forget about her and find someone to take her
Place
Ill be your substitute whenever you want me  ooh ooh 
Oh dont you know Id be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
Ill be your substitute
Whenever you want me  ooh ooh 
Oh dont you know Id be your substitute
Whenever you need me
Ooh ooh ooh
Ill be your substitute whenever you leave her
Oh dont you know Id be your substitute
