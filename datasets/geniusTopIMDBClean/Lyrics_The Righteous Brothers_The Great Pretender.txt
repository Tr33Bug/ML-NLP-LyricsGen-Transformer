Oh yes Im the great pretender
Pretending that Im doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
Im lonely but no one can tell
Oh yes Im the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I seem to be what Im not you see
Im lonely but no one can tell
Too real is this feeling of makebelieve
Too real when I feel what my heart cant conceal
Oh yes Im the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I seem to be what Im not you see
Im wearing my heart as a crown
Pretending that youre still around
Still around
