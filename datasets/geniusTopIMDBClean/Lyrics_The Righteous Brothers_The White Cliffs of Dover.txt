Therell be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow just you wait and see
Ill never forget the people I met
Braving those angry skys
I remember well as the shadows fell
The light of hope in thier eyes
And though Im far away I still can hear them say
Suns up
For when the dawn comes up
Therell be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow just you wait and see
Therell be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow when the world is free
The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again
Therell be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow just you wait and see
Therell be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow just you wait and see
