I think you better
I think you better try to find another man
Try try to find one who loves you
And live with you the best you can
Dont start none of that grieving
This time Im leaving
Im packin up my suitcase
Try to find another man
When I first met you
You were such a sweet thing
You meant everything to me
So I took you for my bride
Yeah in five years youve changed
And now you never do nothin
All you ever do is sit around the TV set feed your fat face
Complain and make my life a complete misery
I think you better
I think you better try to find another man
Try try to find one who loves you
And live with you the best you can
Dont start none of that grieving
This time Im leaving
Im packin up my suitcase
Try to find another man
From the early hours of the morning
Til the late hours at night
You keep on naggin me baby
And tell them folks I do nothin right
Oh I cant stand it no more
And Im fed up with the way you been treating me all life
But theres one thing I want you to know before I go
Theres lots of  in the sea and Im gonna give you one
Yes siree
Oh I think I think you better find
You better find
Go out in the street and find a new man
You need a new man now baby
Get out of my life and stop hangin to me
Ohoh baby
Get out of my life baby
Yeah yeah
