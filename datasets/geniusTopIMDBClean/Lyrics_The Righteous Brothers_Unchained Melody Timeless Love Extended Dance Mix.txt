Unchained Melody  Timeless Love Extended Dance Mix  LyricsWhoooaaaa my lovvve
My darling
Ive hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can doooo so much
Are you still mine
I need your love

God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh Wait for me wait for me
Ill be coming home wait for me
Whoooaaa my loovvve
My darling
Ive hungered hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love

God speed your love to me
