The other night as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you held you in my arms
But when I woke up yeah found out I was mistaken
Ooh I hung my head hung my head and cried
You are my sunshine my only sunshine
Little girl you make me happy when the skies are grey
But youll never know dear just how much I love you
So please dont take dont take my sunshine away
You told me once dear that you really loved me
And that no one could take my pain
But now youve left me and love another
And youve shattered shattered all my dreams
Yeah you are my sunshine my only sunshine  oh my sunshine 
You make me happy yeah  you make me happy  when my skies are grey
But youll never know dear how much that I love you
So please dont take  I would never  not if you need me  no you know I need you now 
Not if you want me  no you know I want you now 
Not if you need me girl  no you know I need you now 
Please dont take  no no no  dont take my sunshine
Dont take my sunshine  no no no no  dont take my sunshine
Dont take my sunshine away
