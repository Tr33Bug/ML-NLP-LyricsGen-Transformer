When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And dont be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown
Walk on walk on
With hope in your heart
And youll never walk alone
Youll never walk alone
