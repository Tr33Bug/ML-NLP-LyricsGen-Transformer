Youre My  Soul and Inspiration LyricsGirl I cant let you do this
Let you walk away
Girl how can I live through this
When youre all I wake up for each day baby
Youre my soul and my hearts inspiration
Youre all I got to get me by
Youre my soul and my hearts inspiration
Without you baby what good am I
I never had much going
But at least I had you
How can you walk out knowing
I aint got nothing left if you do baby
Youre my soul and my hearts inspiration
Youre all I got to get me by
Youre my soul and my hearts inspiration
Without you baby what good am I
Oh what good am I
Baby I cant make it without you
And Im Im telling you honey
Youre my reason for laughing for crying
For living and for dying
Baby I cant make it without you
Please Im begging you baby
If you go it will kill me I swear it
Girl I just cant bear it
Youre my soul and my hearts inspiration
Youre all I got to get me by
Youre my soul and my hearts inspiration
Without you baby what good am I
What good am I
Mmm
Ooh
