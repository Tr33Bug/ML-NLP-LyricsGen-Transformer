You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And theres no tenderness like before
In your fingertips
Youre trying hard not to show it  Baby 
But baby baby I know it
Youve lost that lovin feelin
Whoa that lovin feelin
Youve lost that lovin feelin
Now its gone gone gone whoaohohoh
Now theres no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you
And now youre starting to criticize
Little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying  Baby 
Cause baby something beautifuls dying
Youve lost that lovin feelin
Whoa that lovin feelin
Youve lost that lovin feelin
Now its gone gone gone whoaohohoh
Baby baby Id get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do yeah
We had a love a love a love you dont find every day
So dont dont dont dont let it slip away
Baby  Baby  baby  Baby 
I beg of you please  Please  please  Please 
I need your love  I need your love 
I need your love  I need your love 
So bring it on back  So bring it on back 
Bring it on back  So bring it on back 
Bring back that lovin feelin
Whoa that lovin feeling
