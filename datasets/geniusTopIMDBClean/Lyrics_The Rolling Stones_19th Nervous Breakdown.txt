Youre the kind of person
You meet at certain dismal dull affairs
Centre of a crowd talking much too loud
Running up and down the stairs
Well it seems to me that you have seen
Too much in too few years
And though youve tried you just cant hide
Your eyes are edged with tears
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes here it comes here it comes here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
When you were a child you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your fathers still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes here it comes here it comes here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Oh whos to blame That girls just insane
Well nothing I do dont seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse oh please
You were still in school when you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip I tried so hard
To rearrange your mind
But after while I realized
You were disarranging mine
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes here it comes here it comes here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Oh whos to blame That girls just insane
Well nothing I do dont seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse oh please
When you were a child you were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your fathers still perfecting ways
Of making sealing wax
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown
