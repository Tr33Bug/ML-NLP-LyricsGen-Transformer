Angie Angie
When will those clouds all disappear
Angie Angie
Where will it lead us from here
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You cant say were satisfied
But Angie Angie
You cant say we never tried
Angie youre beautiful yeah
But aint it time we said goodbye
Angie I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie Angie
Where will it lead us from here
Oh Angie dont you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie Angie
Aint it time we said goodbye Yeah
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You cant say were satisfied
But Angie I still love you baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There aint a woman that comes close to you
Come on baby dry your eyes
But Angie Angie
Aint it good to be alive
Angie Angie
They cant say we never tried
