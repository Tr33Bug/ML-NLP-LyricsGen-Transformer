Im feeling so tired cant understand it
Just had a fortnights sleep
Im feeling so stuffed Im so distracted
Aint touched a thing all week
Im feeling drunk juiced up and sloppy
Aint touched a drink all night
Im feeling hungry cant see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie
Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is beating louder than a big bass drum alright
Yeah you got to mix it child you got to fix
It must be love its a bitch
Yeah you got to mix it child you got to fix
It must be love its a bitch alright
Sometimes Im sexy move like a stud
Like kicking the stall all night
Sometimes Im so shy got to be worked on
Dont have no bark or bite alright
Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is bumping louder than a big bass drum alright
I want it woo
I said hey yeah get alright now get it
Got to be

Hey hey hey
