Well when youre sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folk that you know
Well I hope you wont see me in my ragged company
Well you know I could never be alone
Take me down little Susie take me down
I know you think youre the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I wont forget to put roses on your grave
Well when youre sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
Ill be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl can take my pain away
Take me down little Susie take me down
I know you think youre the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I wont forget to put roses on your grave
Hey
Take me down little Susie take me down
I know you think youre the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the US Mail
Say it with dead flowers at my wedding
And I wont forget to put roses on your grave
No I wont forget to put roses on your grave
