I live on an apartment
On the ninetyninth floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window
Imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy
Whos all dressed up just like the Union Jack
Says Ive won five pounds
If I have his kind of detergent pack
I said Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Dont hang around cause twos a crowd
On my cloud baby
The telephone is ringing
I say Hi its me who is it there on the line
A voice says Hi hello how are you
Well I guess Im doing fine
Its three AM theres too much noise
Dont you people ever want to go to bed
Just because you feel so good
Do you have to drive me out of my head
I said Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Dont hang around cause twos a crowd
On my cloud baby
Yeah
I was sick and tired fed up with this
So I decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful
There was nobody not a soul around
I laid myself out
I was so tired and I started to dream
In the morning the parking tickets were just like flags
Stuck on my windscreen


I said Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Dont hang around cause twos a crowd
On my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Hey  Hey  you  You  get off of my cloud
Dont hang around baby twos a crowd
On my cloud
