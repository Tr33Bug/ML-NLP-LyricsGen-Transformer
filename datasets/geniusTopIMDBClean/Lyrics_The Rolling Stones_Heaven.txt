The smell of you baby my senses my senses be praised
The smell of you baby my senses my senses be praised
Kissing and running kissing and running away
Kissing and running kissing and running away
Senses be praised
Senses be praised
Youre my saving grace saving grace
Nothing will harm you and nothing will stand in your way
Nothing nothing nothing
Nothing will stop you and nothing will stand in your way
No one will harm you no one will stand in your way
No one will bar you nothing will stand in your way
Nothing theres nothing
