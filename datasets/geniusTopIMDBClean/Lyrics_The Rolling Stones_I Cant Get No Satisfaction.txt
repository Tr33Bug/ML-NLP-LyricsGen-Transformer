I Cant Get No  Satisfaction Lyrics
I cant get no satisfaction
I cant get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I cant get no I cant get no
When Im driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And hes telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I cant get no oh no no no
Hey hey hey Thats what Ill say
I cant get no satisfaction
I cant get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I cant get no I cant get no
When Im watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he cant be a man cause he doesnt smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I cant get no oh no no no
Hey hey hey thats what I say
I cant get no satisfaction
I cant get no girl reaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I cant get no I cant get no
When Im riding round the world
And Im doing this and Im signing that
And Im trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby better come back maybe next week
Cause you see Im on a losing streak
I cant get no oh no no no
Hey hey hey Thats what Ill say


I cant get no I cant get no I cant get no
I cant get no satisfaction
No satisfaction no satisfaction no satisfaction
I cant get no
