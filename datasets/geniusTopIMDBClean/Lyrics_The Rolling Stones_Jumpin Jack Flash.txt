One two
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the morning drivin rain
But its all right now in fact its a gas
But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash
Its a gas gas gas
I was raised by a toothless bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But its all right now in fact its a gas
But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash
Its a gas gas gas
Oooh
I was drowned I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah yeah yeah
I was crowned with a spike right through my head
My my yeah
But its all right now in fact its a gas
But its all right Im Jumpin Jack Flash
Its a gas gas gas
Jumpin Jack Flash its a gas
Jumpin Jack Flash its a gas
Jumpin Jack Flash its a gas
Jumpin Jack Flash its a gas
Jumpin Jack Flash its a gas
Jumpin Jack Flash its a gas
