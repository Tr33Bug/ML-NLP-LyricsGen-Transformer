Whos that woman on your arm
All dressed up to do you harm
And Im hip to what shell do
Give her just about a month or two
Bit off more than I can chew
And I knew yeah I knew what it was leading to
Some things well I cant refuse
One of them one of them the bedroom blues
She delivers right on time
I cant resist a corny line
But take the shine right off your shoes yeah right off your shoes
Carryin carryin the bedroom blues
Oh yeah in the bar youre getting drunk
Oh yeah oh yeah I aint in love I aint in lust oh no no no
Hide the switch and shut the light wont you shut it
Yeah let it all come down tonight
Maybe your friends think Im just a stranger
Your face Ill never see no more
Let it all come down tonight
Keep those tears hid out of sight
Let it loose yeah let it loose let it loose
Let it loose let it all come down
Let it loose let it loose yeah yeah
Let it loose let it all come down
Let it loose let it all come down
Let it loose let it all come down
