I got nasty habits
I take tea at three
Yes and the meat I eat for dinner
It must be hung up for a week
My best friend he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese
Dont you think theres a place for you
In between the sheets
Come on now honey
We can build a home for three  Yeah 
Come on now honey
Dont you want to live with me
Woo
And theres a score of harebrained children
Theyre all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads they got dirty necks
Theyre so 20th century
Well they queue up for the bathroom
Round about 735
Dont you think we need a womans touch
To make it come alive
Youd look good
Prampushing down the high street
Come on now honey
Dont you want to live with me
Whoa the servants theyre so helpful dear
The cook she is a whore
Yes the butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door
Woo
The maid shes French shes got no sense
Shes from the Crazy Horse
And when she strips the chauffeur flips
The footmans eyes get crossed
Woo
Dont you think theres a place for us
Right across the street
Doncha think theres a place for you
In between the sheets
