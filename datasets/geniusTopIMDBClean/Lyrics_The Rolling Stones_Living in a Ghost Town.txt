Im a ghost
Livin in a ghost town
Im a ghost
Livin in a ghost town
You can look for me
But I cant be found
You can search for me
I had to go underground
Life was so beautiful
Then we all got locked down
Feel like a ghost
Living in a ghost town yeah
Once this place was hummin
And the air was full of drummin
The sound of cymbals crashin
Glasses were all smashin
Trumpets were all screamin
Saxophones were blarin
Nobody was carin if its day or night
Wohohohoh Wohohohoh
Im a ghost
Livin in a ghost town
Im goin nowhere
Shut up all alone
So much time to lose
Just starin at my phone
Every night I am dreamin that youll come and creep in my bed
Please let this be over not stuck in a world without end my friend
Wohohohoh Wohohohoh
Wohohohoh Wohohohoh


Preachers were all preachin
Charities beseechin
Politicians dealin
Thieves were happy stealin
Widows were all weepin
Theres  no beds for us to sleep in
Always had the feelin
It will all come tumblin down
Im a ghost
Livin in a ghost town
You can look for me
But I cant be found
Wohohohoh Wohohohoh
Were all livin in a ghost town  Wohohohoh 
Oh livin in a ghost town  Wohohohoh 
We were so beautiful  Wohohohoh 
I was your man about town  Wohohohoh 
Livin in this ghost town  Wohohohoh 
Aint havin any fun  Wohohohoh 
If I wanna party  Wohohohoh

Wohohohoh
