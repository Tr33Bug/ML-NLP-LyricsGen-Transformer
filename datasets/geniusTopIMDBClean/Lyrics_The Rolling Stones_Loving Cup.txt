Im the man on the mountain come on up
Im the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud
Yes Im fumbling and I know my car dont start
Yes Im stumbling and I know I play a bad guitar
Give me a little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and Ill fall down drunk
Im the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun
Im the man that brings you roses when you aint got none
Well I can run and jump and fish but I wont fight
You if you want to push and pull with me all night
Give me a little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and Ill fall down drunk yeah
I feel so humble with you tonight
Just sitting in front of the fire
See your face dancing in the flame
Feel your mouth kissing me again
What a beautiful buzz what a beautiful buzz
What a beautiful buzz what a beautiful buzz
Oh what a beautiful buzz what a beautiful buzz
Yes I am nitty gritty and my shirts all torn
But I would love to spill the beans with you till dawn
Give me a little drink from your loving cup
Just one drink and Ill fall down drunk
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
Give me a little drink
