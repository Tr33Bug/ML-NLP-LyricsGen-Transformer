Ive been holding out so long
Ive been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
Ive been hanging on the phone
Ive been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you sometime
Ooh ooh oohoohooh
Ooh ooh oohoohooh
Well Ive been haunted in my sleep
Youve been starring in my dreams
Lord I miss you child
Ive been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
Its just some friends of mine that say
Hey whats the matter man
Were goingna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls thats just dying to meet you
Were goinna bring a case of wine
Hey lets go mess and fool around
You know like we used to
Ah ah ahahah
Ah ah ahahah
Oh everybody waits so long
Oh baby why you waitin so long
Wont you come on come on
Ive been walkin Central Park singing after dark
People think Im crazy
Stumbling on my feet shuffling through the street
Asking people Whats the matter with you boy
Sometimes I want to say to to myself
Sometimes I say
Ooh ooh oohoohooh
Ooh ooh I wont miss you child
I guess Im lying to myself
Its just you and no one else
Lord I wont miss you child
Youve just been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No I wont miss you baby yeah
Ah ah ahahah

Ah ah ahahah
Lord I miss you child
Ah ah ahahah
