Im a fleabit peanut monkey
All my friends are junkies
Thats not really true
Im a cold Italian pizza
I could use a lemon squeezer
What you do
But Ive been bit and Ive been tossed around
By every sherat in this town
Have you babe
Well I am just a monkey man
Im glad you are a monkey woman too
I was bitten by a boar
I was gouged and I was gored
But I pulled on through
Yes Im a sack of broken eggs
I always have an unmade bed
Dont you
Well I hope were not too messianic
Or a trifle too satanic
We love to play the blues
Well I am just a monkey man
Im glad you are a monkey monkey woman too babe
Im a monkey Im a monkey
Im a monkey babe  Im a monkey babe
Im a monkey Im a monkey Im a monkey Im a monkey
Mmmmonkey Mmmmmonkey Im a mmmmonkey
Mmmma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma monkey
Ah Im a monkey
Ah Ah Ah Ah
