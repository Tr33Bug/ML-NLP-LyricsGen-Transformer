When the wind blows and the rain feels cold
With a head full of snow with a head full of snow
In the window theres a face you know
Dont the night pass slow Dont the nights pass slow
The sound of strangers sending nothing to my mind
Just another mad mad day on the road
I am just living to be lying by your side
But Im just about a moonlight mile on down the road
Made a rag pile of my shiny clothes
Going to warm my bones going to warm my bones
Ive got silence on my radio
Let the airwaves flow let the airwaves flow
For I am sleeping under strange strange skies
Just another mad mad day on the road
My dreams is fading down the railway line
Im just about a moonlight mile on down the road
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Im hiding sister and Im dreaming
Im riding down your moonlight mile
Im hiding baby but Im dreaming
Im riding down your moonlight mile
Im riding down your moonlight mile
Let it go now
Come on up baby
Yeah let it go now
Yeah
Flow now baby
Yeah come on now yeah
Hey
Yeah Im coming home
Cause Im just about a moonlight mile on down the road
On down the road on down the road
Yeah yeah baby
