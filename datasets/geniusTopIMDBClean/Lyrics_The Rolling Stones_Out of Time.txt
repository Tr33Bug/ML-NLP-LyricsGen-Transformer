You dont know whats going on
Youve been away for far too long
You cant come back and think you are still mine
Youre out of touch my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
Well baby baby baby youre out of time
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
You are left out
Out of there without a doubt cause
Baby baby baby youre out of time
The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that shes had her day
Its no good youre thinking that you are still mine
Youre out of touch my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
Well baby baby baby youre out of time
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
Yes you are left out
Out of there without a doubt cause
Baby baby baby youre out of time
You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you cant come back and be the first in line oh no
Youre obsolete my baby
My poor oldfashioned baby
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
Well baby baby baby youre out of time
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
Yes you are left out
Out of there without a doubt cause
Baby baby baby youre out of time
Sing the song now
Baby baby baby youre out of time
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
Baby baby baby youre out of time
You dont know whats going on
Youve been away for much too long
But you cant come back and think you are still mine
Youre out of touch my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said Baby baby baby youre out of time
Well baby baby baby youre out of time
I said baby baby baby youre out of time
Yes you are left out yes you are
I said no out of there without a doubt cause
