Well youve got your diamonds
And youve got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
But dont play with me
Cause youre playing with fire
Your mother shes an heiress
Owns a block in Saint Johns Wood
And your fatherd be there with her
If he only could
But dont play with me
Cause youre playing with fire
Your old man took her diamonds
And tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
So dont play with me
Cause youre playing with fire
Now youve got some diamonds
And you will have some others
But youd better watch your step girl
Or start living with your mother
So dont play with me
Cause youre playing with fire
So dont you play with me
Cause youre playing with fire
