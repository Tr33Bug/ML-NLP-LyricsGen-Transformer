Oh yeah
I hear you talking when Im on the street
Your mouth dont move but I can hear you speak
Whats the matter with the boy
He dont come around no more
Is he checking out for sure
Is he gonna close the door on me
And Im always hearing voices on the street
I want to shout but I can hardly speak
I was making love last night to a dancer friend of mine
I cant seem to stay in step
Because she come every time that she pirouettes over me
And I only get my rocks off while Im dreaming
Only get them off only get them off only get them off 
I only get my rocks off while Im sleeping
Only get them off only get them off 
Im zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in flush out and fire the fucking feed
Heading for the overload
Splattered on the nasty road
Kick me like youve kicked before
I cant even feel the pain no more
And I only get my rocks off while Im dreaming
Only get them off only get them off only get them off 
I only get my rocks off while Im sleeping
Only get them off only get them off 
Feel so hypnotized cant describe the scene oh
Its all mesmerized all that inside me oh
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery
Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like youve kicked before
I cant even feel the pain no more
And I only get my rocks off while Im dreaming
Only get them off only get them off only get them off 
I only get my rocks off while Im sleeping
Only get them off only get them off 
And I only get my rocks off while Im dreaming
Only get them off only get them off only get them off 
And I only get my rocks off while Im sleeping
Only get them off only get them off 
And I only get my rocks off while Im sleeping
Only get them off only get them off only get them off 
Only get them off get them off only get them off
