She would never say where she came from
Yesterday dont matter if its gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day
Still Im going to miss you
Dont question why she needs to be so free
Shell tell you its the only way to be
She just cant be chained
To a life where nothings gained
And nothings lost
At such a cost
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day
Still Im going to miss you
Theres no time to lose I heard her say
Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind
Aint life unkind
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day
Still Im going to miss you

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you
When you change with every new day
Still Im going to miss you
