She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
Shes like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh everywhere
She comes in colours
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
Shes like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh everywhere
She comes in colours
Have you seen her dressed in blue
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
Shes like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh everywhere
She comes in colours
Have you seen her all in gold
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
Shes like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh everywhere
She comes in colours
Shes like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh everywhere
She comes in colours
