Saw you stretched out in room tenohnine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye
Oh couldnt see to get a line on you my sweet honey love
Berber jewelry jangling down the street
Making bloodshot eyes at every woman that you meet
Could not seem to get a high on you my sweet honey love
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
When youre drunk in the alley baby with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn
Whoa just seemed too many flies on you
I just cant brush them off
Angels beating all their wings in time
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes
Whoa thought I heard one sigh for you
Come on up come on up now come on up now
May the good Lord shine a light on you yeah
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you yeah
Warm like the evening sun
Now now now yeah
Come on up now come on up now
Come on up now come on up
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song you sing your favorite tune
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun
Now now now now now yeah
Yeah yeah
