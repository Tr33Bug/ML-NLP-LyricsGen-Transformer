Here I lie in my hospital bed
Tell me Sister Morphine when are you coming round again
Oh and I dont think I can wait that long
Oh you see that Im not that strong
The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears
Tell me Sister Morphine how long have I been lying here
What am I doing in this place
Why does the doctor have no face
Oh I cant crawl across the floor
Ah cant you see Sister Morphine Im trying to score
Hey
Well it just goes to show things are not what they seem
Please Sister Morphine turn my nightmare into dreams
Oh cant you see Im fading fast
And that this shot will be my last
Sweet Cousin Cocaine lay your cool cool hand on my head
Ah come on Sister Morphine you better make up my bed
Because you know and I know in the morning Ill be dead
Yeah and you can sit around yeah and you can watch
All the clean white sheets stained red
Hey
Yeah
