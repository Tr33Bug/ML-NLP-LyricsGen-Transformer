If you start me up
If you start me up Ill never stop
If you start me up
If you start me up Ill never stop
Ive been running hot
You got me ticking now dont blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up Ill never stop
Never stop never stop never stop
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Spread out the oil the gasoline
I walk smooth ride in a mean mean machine
Start it up
If you start it up
Kick on the starter give it all you got
You got to you got to
I cant compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it I can slide it up
Slide it up slide it up slide it up
Dont make a grown man cry
Dont make a grown man cry
Dont make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate my lips go green
My hands are greasy shes a mean mean machine
Start it up
Start me up
Ah ah give it all youve got
Youve got to never never never stop
Slide it up whoo
Ah rev it up to start it up
Start it up start it up start it up
Never never never
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind at double speed
Ill take you places that youve never never seen
Hey hey
If you start it up
Love the day and we will never stop never stop
Never never never stop
Start me up
Never stop never stop
You you you make a grown man cry
You you make a dead man cum
You you make a dead man cum
