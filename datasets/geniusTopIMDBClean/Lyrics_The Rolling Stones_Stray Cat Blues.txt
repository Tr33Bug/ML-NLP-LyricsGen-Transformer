Ah hey
Yeah got some tail
I hear the clickclack of your feet on the stairs
I know youre no scareeyed honey
Therell be a feast if you just come upstairs but
Its no hanging matter
Its no capital crime
I can see that youre fifteen years old
No I dont want your ID
And I can see that youre so far from home but
Thats no hanging matter
Its no capital crime
Oh yeah youre a strange stray cat
Oh yeah dont you scratch like that
Oh yeah youre a strange stray cat
I bet bet your mama dont know you scream like that
I bet your mother dont know you can spit like that
You look so weird and youre so far from home
Bet you dont really miss your mother
You look so scared Im not no madbrained bear
But but its no hanging matter
Its no capital crime
Oh yeah
Woo
I bet your mama dont know that you scratch like that
I bet she dont know you can bite like that


You say you got a friend that shes wilder than you
Why dont you bring her upstairs
If shes so wild then she can join in too
Its no hanging matter
Its no capital crime
Oh yeah youre a strange stray cat
Oh yeah dont you scratch like that
Oh yeah youre a strange stray cat
I bet your mama dont know you can bite like that
Ill bet she never saw you scratch my back
