Everywhere I hear the sound
Of marching charging feet boy
Cause summers here and the time is right
For fighting in the street boy
Well what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band
Cause in sleepy London Town
Theres just no place for street fighting man no
Hey think the time is right
For a palace revolution
Cause where I live the game to play
Is compromise solution
Well then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band
Cause in sleepy London Town
Theres just no place for street fighting man no
Get down
Hey said my name is called Disturbance
Ill shout and scream Ill kill the king
Ill rail at all his servants
Well then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band
Because in sleepy London Town
Theres just no place for street fighting man no
Get down
