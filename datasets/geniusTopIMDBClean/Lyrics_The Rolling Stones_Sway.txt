One two three four
Did you ever wake up to find
A day that broke up your mind
Destroyed your notion of circular time
Its just that demon life has got you in its sway
Its just that demon life has got you in its sway
Aint flinging tears out on the dusty ground
For my friends out on the burial ground
Cant stand the feeling getting so brought down
Its just that evil life that got me in its sway
Its just that evil life that got me in its sway
There must be ways to find out
Love is the way they say is really strutting out
Whoo
Hey hey hey now
One day I woke up to find
Right in the bed next to mine
Someone that broke me up with a corner of her smile yeah
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway 
Its just that demon life has got me
