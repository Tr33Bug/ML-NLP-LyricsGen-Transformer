Right in the bed next to mine
Someone that broke me up with a corner of her smile yeah
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway
Its just that demon life that got me in its sway 


Its just that demon life has got me
