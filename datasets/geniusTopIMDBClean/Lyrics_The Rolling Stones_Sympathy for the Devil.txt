Huh huh huh
Please allow me to introduce myself
Im a man of wealth and taste
Ive been around for a long long year
Stole many a mans soul and faith
I was round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game
I stuck around St Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank held a generals rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name oh yeah
But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game ah yeah
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out Who killed the Kennedys
Well after all it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
Im a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name oh yeah
But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game ah yeah
Oh yeah get down heavy
Pleased to meet you hope you guess my name oh yeah
But whats confusin you is just the nature of my game mm yeah
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails just call me Lucifer
Cause Im in need of some restraint
So if you meet me have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your welllearned politesse
Or Ill lay your soul to waste mm yeah
Pleased to meet you hope you guessed my name mm yeah
But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game mmm mean it
