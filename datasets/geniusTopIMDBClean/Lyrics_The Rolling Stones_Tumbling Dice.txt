Mmm yeah
Women think Im tasty but theyre always tryin to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby baby I dont need no jewels in my crown
Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin like I dont know how
But baby I go crazy theres fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin got my poor feet aitchin
You know you know the deuce is still wild
Baby I cant stay you got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice
Always in a hurry I never stop to worry
Dont see the time flashin by
Honey got no money
Im all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now baby Im the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby I cant stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice
Baby oh my
Oh my my my Im the lone craps shooter
Playing the field every night
Baby get it straight
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling dice
Got to roll me  Call me the tumbling dice 
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me  Oh oh yeah 
Got to roll me  Oh oh 
Got to roll me  Oh yeah 
Got to roll me  Oh keep on rolling 
Got to roll me  Oh keep on rolling 
Got to roll me  Oh yeah keep on rolling
