Intro
Watching girls go passing by
It aint the latest thing
Im just standing in a doorway
Im just trying to make some sense
Out of these girls that passing by
The tales they tell of men
Im not waiting on a lady
Im just waiting on a friend
A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
Im not waiting on a lady
Im just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Im just waiting on a friend
Im just waiting on a friend
Bridge
Dont need a whore I dont need no booze
Dont need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But Im not waiting on my lady
Im just waiting on a friend
Im just waiting on a friend
Im just waiting on a friend
Im just waiting on a friend
Im just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend
Waiting on a friend
