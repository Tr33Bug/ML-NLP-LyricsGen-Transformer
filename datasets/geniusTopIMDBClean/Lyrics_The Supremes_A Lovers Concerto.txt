A Lovers Concerto
Artist The Supremes
Denny RandellSandy Linzert 
How gentle is the rain
That falls softly on the meadow
Birds high up in the trees
Serenade the flowers with their melodies
Oh see there beyond the hill
The bright colours of the rainbow
Some magic from above
Made this day for us just to fall in love
Now I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And Ill give to you every part of me
Oh dont ever make me cry
Through long lonely nights without love
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally
Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
Well walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above singing once again
Youll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
Youll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
Just hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
Youll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful
