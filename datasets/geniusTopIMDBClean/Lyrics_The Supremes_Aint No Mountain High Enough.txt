Listen baby aint no mountain high
Aint no valley low
Aint no river wide enough baby
If you need me call me
No matter where you are no matter how far
Dont worry baby 
Just call my name Ill be there in a hurry
You dont have to worry
Cause baby there
Aint no mountain high enough
Aint no valley low enough
Aint no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe
Remember the day I set you free
I told you could always count on me darling  Yeah baby 
From that day on I made a vow
Ill be there when you want me
Some way somehow
Cause baby there
Aint no mountain high enough
Aint no valley low enough
Aint no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe
Oh no darling
No wind no rain or winters cold
Can stop me baby oh no
Cause you are my goal
If youre ever in trouble Ill be there on the double
Just send for me oh baby
My love is alive deep down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
Ill be there on the double just as fast as I can
Dont you know that there
Aint no mountain high enough
Aint no valley low enough
Aint no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe
Dont you know that there aint no mountain high enough
Aint no valley low enough
Aint no river wide enough
Aint no valley low enough
