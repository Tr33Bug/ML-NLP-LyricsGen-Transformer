Oh Baby lets take lifes highway
Its automatically yours and my way
No road is too rough to travel
Well walk barefoot on lifes gravel
Together whatever we express now
Automatically means success now
Whatever mystery lifes about
Theres no doubt well work it out
CHORUS
Cause youre mine and Im yours
So who cares if when it rains it pours
Im yours and youre mine
Its automatically sunshine
Oh baby until you find you
Automatically Im behind you
So do your thing and always know
Where you go Im going to follow
Dont you worry when youre setback
Home youll hurry and then youll get back
All the courage my love can give
All our lives long as we live
CHORUS
