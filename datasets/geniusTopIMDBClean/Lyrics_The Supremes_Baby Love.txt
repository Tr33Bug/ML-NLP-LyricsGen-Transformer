Ooooh
Baby love my baby love
I need you oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long
Cause baby love my baby love
Been missing ya miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Lets do some kissing and making up
Dont throw our love away
In my arms why dont you stay
Need ya need ya
Baby love ooh baby love
Baby love my baby love
Why must we separate my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do
I get this need
Ooh ooh need to hold you
Once again my love
Feel your warm embrace my love
Dont throw our love away
Please dont do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me
My love my baby love
I need you oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After Ive been true to you
So deep in love with you
Baby baby ooh till its hurtin me
Till its hurtin me
Ooh baby love
Dont throw our love away
Dont throw our love away
