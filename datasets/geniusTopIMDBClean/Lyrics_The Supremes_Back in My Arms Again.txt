Oooh
All day long I hear my telephone ring
Friends calling giving their advice
From the boy I love I should break away
Cause heartaches hell bring one day
I lost him once through friends advice
But its not gonna happen twice
Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights
Ooh
But now hes back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
Its easy for friends to say let him go
But Im the one who needs him so
Its his love that makes me strong
Without him I cant go on
This time Ill live my life at ease
Being happy lovin whom I please
And each time we make romance
Ill be thankful for a second chance
Ooh
Cause hes back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
Ooh
How can Mary tell me what to do
When she lost her love so true
And Flo she dont know
Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo

I listened once to my friends advice
But its not gonna happen twice
Cause all advice ever gotten me
Was many long and sleepless nights
Ooh
I got him back in my arms again
Right by my side
I got him back in my arms again
So satisfied
Ooh
Im satisfied yeah
So satisfied
Im satisfied
Im satisfied
So satisfied
Im satisfied
Im satisfied
