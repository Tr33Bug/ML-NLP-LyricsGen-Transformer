But I love you more than Ive ever loved anyone baby
He says the same things you used to say
Does the same things you used to do
Sometimes I miss you baby 
Sometimes I find myself wishing he was you
Cause I still miss you  Oh yeah 
And I love you more than Ill ever love anyone
Yes I love you more than Ill ever love anyone
Thoughts of you still burn in my mind
But my new love takes all my time
Sometimes I miss you baby 
With him I can get away
Cheatin yesterday
Cause he makes me forget you  sometimes  Oh yeah 
But I love you more than Ill ever loved anyone
Yes Ill love you more than Ill ever love anyone
If youd never left me lonely
You still love me
But he satisfied my eyes that hungered for you
Though I tried not to love him
The feeling just grew
But I love you more than Ill ever love anyone
Yes I love you more than Ill ever love anyone
Yes I love you more than Ill ever love anyone
I love you more anyone
Yes I love you more than Ill ever love anyone
