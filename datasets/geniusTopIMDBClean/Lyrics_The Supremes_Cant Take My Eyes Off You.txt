Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
Youd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive
Youre just to good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
Pardon the way that I stare
Theres nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that its real
Youre just to good to be true
And my baby
Cant take my eyes off of you
I love you baby
And if its quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh baby baby
Dont bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I found you stay
Let me love you baby
Let me love you baby
Youre just too good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
Youd be like heaven to touch
And I wanna hold so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God Im alive
Youre just to good to be true
Cant take my eyes off of you
I love you baby
And if its quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby
Dont bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I found you stay
