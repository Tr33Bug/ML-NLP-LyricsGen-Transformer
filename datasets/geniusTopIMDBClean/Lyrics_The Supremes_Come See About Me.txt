Ive been crying  Ooh ooh 
Cause Im lonely  For you 
Smiles have all turned  To tears 
But tears wont wash away the fears
That youre never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin baby for you
So wont you hurry
Come on boy see about me
Come see about me 
See about you baby
Come see about me 
Ive given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine
No matter what you do or say
Im gonna love you anyway
Keep on crying baby for you
Im gonna keep sighin baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
Come see about me 
See about you baby
Come see about me 
Sometimes up  ooh ooh 
Sometimes down  ooh ooh 
My lifes so uncertain  ooh ooh 
With you not around  ooh ooh 
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says youre here to keep


Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on keep on crying baby for you
So wont you hurry
Come on boy see about me
Come see about me 
See about you baby
Come see about me 
You know Im so lonely
Come see about me 
I love you only
Come see about me 
See about your baby
Come see about me 
Hurry hurry
Come see about me
