Hey
Yeah
Ooooooooooooh
Hes my man
Hes my man
Hes my man
Hes my man 
Hes my man
As I go through the week
Counting all the days
Seeing the same old faces
Seeing the same old wayayays
Now other men mean well
But always bring me down
They have nothing new to say
Theyre still hangin round
And when I need cheering up
When Im feeling kinda low
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
And you can see us glow wherever we may go
Hes my man
All I need is that he shine his smile on me
When Im all alone needing company
And hes the only man who can make me feel
That his love is honest
That his love is real
And when my spirits sinking down
Need a lift off the ground
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
And you can see us glow wherever we may go
Hes my man
He and I belong together
He and I will be forever
My friends all say hes no good
But theyd have him if they could
But hes my man Ooooooooh
Hes my man
Ahahhh
Hes my man
Hes my man
Hes my man
Hes my man
He is my man
Hes my man
Yes he is now
He calls says get dressed
And I put on my best
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
Cant you see it
And you can see us glow wherever we may go
Hes my manananananan Yeah
Hes my man
Ahahhhh
Hes my man
Hes my man
Hes my man
Hes my man

Hes my man

He calls says get dressed and I put on my best whoo
Hes my man
Being in his arms brings out all my charms
Hes my man
