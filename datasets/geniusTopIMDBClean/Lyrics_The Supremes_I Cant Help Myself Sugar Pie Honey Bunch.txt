I Cant Help Myself  Sugar Pie Honey Bunch  LyricsSugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I cant help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye
I come a running to you
Im tied to your baby
And theres nothing I can do
Ooh sugar
Sugarpie honeybunch
Im weaker than a girl should be
I cant help myself
Im a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I dont love you
Tell you that were through
And Ive tried
But everytime I see your face
I get up all choked up inside
When I call your name boy
It starts the flame burning in my heart
Tearin it all apart
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide
Sugarpie honeybunch
You now that Im weak for you
I cant help myself
I love you and nobody else
Sugarpie honeybunch
Do you anything you ask me to
I cant help myself
I want you and nobody else
Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I cant help myself
