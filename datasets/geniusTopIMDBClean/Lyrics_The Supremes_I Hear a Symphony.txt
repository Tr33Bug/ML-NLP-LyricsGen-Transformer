Youve given me a true love
And every day I thank you love
For a feeling thats so new
So inviting so exciting
Whenever youre near I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer closer to your arms
Then suddenly  I hear a symphony 
Ooh your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
Im lost in a world
Made for you and me
Whenever youre near I hear a symphony
Play sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine now baby baby baby
You bring much joy within
Dont let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby baby baby
Those tears that fill my eyes
I cry not for myself
But for those whove never felt the joy we felt  baby 
Whenever youre near I hear a symphony
Each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love now baby baby
As you stand holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air now baby baby
Dont let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Ooh so close to me baby baby baby baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
