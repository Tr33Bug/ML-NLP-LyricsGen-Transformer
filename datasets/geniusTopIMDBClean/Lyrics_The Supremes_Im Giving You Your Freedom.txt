Youre doing me wrong
Leading me on
I can see theres no need for me
So Im gonna have to set you free
Im giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
Theres no sense in both of us
Making each other blue
Every time I wanted you around
You were nowhere to be found
The price I pay to love you
Is too much to bear
And its unfair when you dont really care
Im giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
Theres no sense in both of us
Making each other blue
I tried so hard to make you happy with me
But now I see our love could never be
I cant deny Im still in love with you
But this is it Im callin it quits
Im giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
Theres no sense in both of us
Making each other blue
Theres no sense in the both of us
Making each other blue
Theres no sense in the both of us
Making each other blue
