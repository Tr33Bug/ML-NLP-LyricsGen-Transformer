Oohoohooh
Mom was cooking bread
She wore a dirty raggedy scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low rolled to her feet she just didnt know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so afraid for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her
In a college town
Away from home a new identity I found
Said I was born elite with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said Mama died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house never even boarded a train
Married a guy was living high I didnt want him to know her
She had a grandson 2 years old that I never even showed her
Im living in shame
Mama I miss you
I know youre not to blame
Mama I miss you
Came a telegram
Mama passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best
Ah cooking cleaning always in the same old dress
Working hard down on her knees always trying to please
Mama mama mama can you hear me
Mama mama mama can you hear me
Im living in shame
Mama I miss you
I know youve done your best
Mama I miss you

Wont you forgive me Mom
For all the wrong Ive done
I know youve done your best
Ooh I know youve done the very best you could
But I never understood
Working hard down on your knees
