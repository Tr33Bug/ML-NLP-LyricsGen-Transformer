Keep falling in and out of love  Keep falling in and out of love 
In search for what Im dreaming of
I long to find a love Im sure about
That certain kind of love that moves all doubts
Keep falling in and out of love  Keep falling in and out of love 
Still searchin for that special one  Searchin for that special one 
To whom I can give my love completely
And feel a lasting love so sweetly
Just when I feel sure loves here to stay  Still searchin searchin for love 
It seems to suddenly just fade away  Still searchin searchin for love 
Cant seem to find that everlasting love  Still searchin searchin for love 
That this heart of mine needs so much of  Still searchin searchin for love 
Keep falling in and out of love  Keep falling in and out of love 
Cant seem to find the lasting kind  Cant seem to find the lasting kind 
It seems I cant find the joy I need
Love always somehow all goes wrong for me
Keep falling in and out of love 
Keep falling in and out of love 
Ooh I keep reaching out for tenderness
Touching a hand that holds emptiness
Well Im looking for a love that lingers on  Still searchin searchin for love 
Long after that first kiss is gone  Still searchin searchin for love 
That kind of love that keeps burning bright  Still searchin searchin for love 
Long after weve said goodnight  Still searchin searchin for love 
Keep falling in and out of love  Keep falling in and out of love 
In search for what Im dreaming of  Keep falling in and out of love 
Keep falling in and out of love
