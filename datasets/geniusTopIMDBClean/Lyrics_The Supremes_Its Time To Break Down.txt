For your lovin  oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah when you touch me
Im at the crossroads of life
And I dont know if I should go left or right
My mind is confused my heart is too
Why your voice is ringin ringin in my ear
Its time to break down time to say yeah
Time to take time  Time to take time 
Give my heart a chance to breathe
Feel this fire inside of me
Ill never be free  from wanting you 
My heart is your prisoner yeah
Youre like a light in my pathway
Youre like a fire that gets higher day after day
I pretend I dont see this spell you cast over me
But the truth is you see all upon my face
Its time to break down time to say yeah
Oh baby time to take time  time to take time
