Tenement slum
Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh ah 
You think that I dont feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In those eyes I see reflected
A hurt scorned rejected
Love child never meant to be
Love child born in poverty
Love child never meant to be
Love child take a look at me
Started my life in an old cold rundown
Tenement slum  Tenement slum 
My father left he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name
Ah this love were contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
Well only end up hating
The child we may be creating
Love child never meant to be  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Love child  Scorned by  society
Love child always second best  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Love child different from the rest
Hold on hold on just a little bit longer  Mmm baby
Hold on hold on just a little bit longer  Mmm baby
I started school in a worn torn dress that somebody threw out  Somebody threw out 
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me
Ah dont think that I dont need you
Dont think I dont wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame Ive been wearing


Love child love child never quite as good  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Afraid ashamed misunderstood  Just a little bit longer love child 
But Ill always love you  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Ill always love you  Just a little bit longer love child 
Ill always love you  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Always love you  Just a little bit longer love child 
Ill always love you  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Always love you  Just a little bit longer love child 
You you you  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Ill always love you  Just a little bit longer love child 
Always love you  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
You  Just a little bit longer love child 
You  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Ill always love you  Just a little bit longer love child 
Take a look take a look at me  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on 
Love child love child  Just a little bit longer love child 
Ill always love you  Wait wait wont you wait now hold on
