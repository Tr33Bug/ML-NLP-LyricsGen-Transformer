Love is here  Love is here  and oh my darling
Now youre gone  Now youre gone 
Love is here  Love is here  and oh my darling
Now now youre gone  Now youre gone 
You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waitin there
Look what youve done 
You closed the door to your heart
Look what youve done 
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
Love is here  Love is here  and oh my darlin
Now youre gone  Now youre gone 
You made me love you  You made me love you 
And oh my darlin now youre gone  Now youre gone 
You said lovin you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked just walked away
Look what youve done 
You stripped me of my dreams
Look what youve done 
You gave me faith then took my hope
Look at me now
Look at me see what lovin you has done to me
Look at my face  Look at my face 
See how cryin has left its trace  Left its trace 
After you made me all your own  Made me all your own 
Then you left me all alone  Left me all alone 
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldnt keep
Look what youve done 
My heart cries out for your touch
Look what youve done 
But youre not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air
Love is here  Love is here  and oh my darlin
Now youre gone  Now youre gone 
Love is here  Love is here  and oh my darlin
Now youre gone  Now youre gone 
You made me love you  You made me love you 
Oh my darlin now youre gone  Now youre gone 
You made me love you   You made me love you 
Ooh oh my darlin now youre gone  Now youre gone
