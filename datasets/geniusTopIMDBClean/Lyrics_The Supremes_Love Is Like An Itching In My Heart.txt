The love bug done bit me
Didnt mean for him to get me
Whoo
Get up in the morning and Im filled with desire
No no I cant stop the fire
Love is a real live wire
Oooh its a burning sensation far beyond imagination
Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby I cant scratch it
Keeps me sighing  Oooh oooh oooh 
Keeps me crying
Keeps me yearning keeps me burning
No mama cant help me
Keeps me tossing keeps me turning 
No daddy cant help me
Keeps me yearning keeps me burning 
Ive been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information to help me out of this situation
Now when youre ill you take a pill
When youre thirsty drink your fill
What you gonna do oh yeah
When love gets a hold a hold on you
Love is like an itching in my heart
And baby I cant scratch it
Love is a nagging irritation causing my heart complication
Love is a growing infection and I dont know the correction
Got me rocking and areeling and I cant shake the feeling
Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby I cant scratch it
Keeps me sighing  Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh 
Keeps me crying
Keeps me yearning keeps me burning
Keeps me tossing keeps me turning
Keeps me yearning  keeps me burning 
Ive been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information to help me out of this situation
Love is a nagging irritation causing my heart complication
Ive been bitten by the love bug
