Oohoohooh oohooh ooh heat wave 
Oohoohooh oohooh ooh heat wave 
Its like a heat wave 
Its like a heat wave 
Whenever Im with him
Something inside
Starts to burnin
And Im filled with desire
Could it be a devil in me
Or is this the way loves supposed to be
Its like a heat wave
Burnin in my heart
I cant keep from cryin
Its tearin me apart
Whenever he calls my name
Soft low sweet and plain
I feel right there
I feel that burnin flame
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way loves supposed to be
Its like a heat wave
Burnin in my heart
I cant keep from cryin
Its tearin me apart
Oohoohooh oohooh ooh heat wave 
Oohoohooh oohooh ooh heat wave 
Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I cant explain it dont understand it
I aint never felt like this before
Now this funny feelin has me amazed
Dont know what to do my heads in a haze


Its like a heat wave
Hey
Yeahyeah yeahyeah
Ho ho ho yeah
Yeahyeah yeahyeah
Ho ho ho yeah
I feel it
Burnin right here in my heart
Its like a heat wave
Hoo
Yeahyeah yeahyeah
Ho ho ho yeah
Yeahyeah
