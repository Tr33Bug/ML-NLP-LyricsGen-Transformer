Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudel
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Girls in white dresses and blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on your nose and eye lashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When Im feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I dont feel so bad
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When Im feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I dont feel so bad
Then I dont feel so bad
Girls in white dresses
Blue satin sashes
Snowflakes on my eye lashes
Ooh my favorite things
