Stop hurting me
Now dont you think youre overdoing it
I still care
I must admit
I know that if we ever break up
I know youll never make up
And Im sorry
So sorry
But my heart cant take it no more
How the times you lied
You know how many times
I cried
Lonely tears brought me misery
Maybe one day you realize
Just how I really tried darling
To make you happy
I gave my heart
You only took it
And destroyed it
And now you say its me you love
Yet you cheated
And deceived me
And now you say you want to keep me
And Im sorry
So sorry
But my heart cant take it no more
My heart cant take it no more
My heart cant take it no more
