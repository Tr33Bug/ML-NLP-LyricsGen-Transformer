My world is empty without you babe
My world is empty without you babe
And as I go my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength I need your tender touch
I need the love my dear
I miss so much
My world is empty without you babe
My world is empty without you babe
From this whole world I try to hide my face  I need you babe 
But from this loneliness theres no hiding place  I need you babe 
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell  I need you babe 
In darkness with memories I know so well  I need you babe 
I need love now more than before
I can hardly carry on anymore
My world is empty without you babe
Without you babe without you babe
My mind and soul have felt like this  I need you babe 
Since love between us no more exists  I need you babe 
And each time that darkness falls  I need you babe 
It finds me alone with these four walls  I need you babe 
My world is empty without you babe
Without you babe without you babe
My world is empty without you babe 
Without you babe without you babe
My world is empty without you babe 
Without you babe without you babe
My world is empty without you babe 
Without you babe
