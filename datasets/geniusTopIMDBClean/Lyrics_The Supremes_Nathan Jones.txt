You packed your bags as I recall
And you walked slowly down the hall
You said you had to get away to ease your mind
And all you needed was a just little of time
Oh winters passed spring and fall
You never wrote me you never called
Yeah  Nathan Jones youve been gone too long
Gone too long  Gone too long 
If a woman could die of tears
Nathan Jones I wouldnt be here
The key that youre holding wont fit my door
And theres no room in my heart for you no more
Cause winters passed spring and fall
You never wrote me you never called
Ohoh  Nathan Jones youve been gone too long
Gone too long
Dododo
Nathan Jones
Nathan Jones
Mmhmm
Nathan Jones oh
Winters passed spring and fall
You never wrote me you never called
Ohoh  Nathan Jones youve been gone too long
Mmmmmm Gone too long  Gone too long 
Nathan Jones youve been gone too long  Gone too long 
Youve been gone too long  Gone too long 
Hey Nathan Jones youve been gone too long  Gone too long 
Hey you know youve been gone  Gone too long 
Nathan Jones youve been gonne too long  Gone too long
