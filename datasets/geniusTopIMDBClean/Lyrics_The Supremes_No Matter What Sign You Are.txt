The moon shines bright above but the charts declare
Its not my night for love ah deep in my heart
I feel a good vibrations sayin
You and me babe would make a good combination
Theres no need in looking to the skies
Cant you see the stars shine in my eyes
I love you boy I really love you boy
No matter what sign you are
Youre gonna be mine you are
Cant let astrology chart our destiny
No matter what sign you are
Youre gonna be mine you are
The beat of the heart my love
Is stronger than the charts my love
Ooh strange vibrations
Ooh good combination
Your water sign just lit my fire
You fill me with such desire
I love you boy I really love you boy
No matter what sign you are
Youre gonna be mine you are
Cant let astrology chart our destiny
No matter what sign you are
Youre gonna be mine you are
I need you beside me love
Only you can guide my love
