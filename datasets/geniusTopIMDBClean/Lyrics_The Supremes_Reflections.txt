Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me
Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
Oh Im all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world thats
A distorted reality
Happiness you took from me
And left me alone ah
With only memories
Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that Im crying
Reflects a hurt I cant control
Cause although youre gone
I keep holdin on
To the happy times
Oh when you were mine
As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
All the love  All the love
That Ive wasted
All the tears  All the tears
That Ive tasted
All in vain
Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream thats lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be
In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all thats left of loving you
Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me
In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust
