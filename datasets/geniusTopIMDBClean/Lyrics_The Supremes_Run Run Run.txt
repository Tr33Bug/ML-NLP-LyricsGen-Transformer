Girls gather round me
And hear the news
He finally kissed me
Oh happy days
My hearts gotta shout it
Ill get my diary
And write about it
Well as your friends
We want to say
Hell break your heart one day
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh but hes such a quiet kind of guy
How he thrills me my oh my
Maybe it isnt true
What they say about him
Dont be fooled
By the shyness in his eyes
Dont you know
Hes just a devil in disguise
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Well as your friends
We want to say
Hell make a fool of you one day
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

But how can I run away
When I love him more each day
So with him Im gonna stay
Ill take my chances along the way
He won my heart from the start
From him I will never never part
I love him so love him so
Never let him go
Every time he gets nearer
My love gets dearer so much dearer
Oh no no no
