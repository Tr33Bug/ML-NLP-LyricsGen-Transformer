Look out Santas coming
Look out Santas coming
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
Im telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Hes making a list
Hes checking it twice
Gonna find out whos naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
He knows when youre asleep
He knows when youre awake
He knows when youve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
Im telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Look out Santas coming
Look out Santas coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
Look out Santas coming
Look out Santas coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
He knows when you are sleeping
He knows when youre awake
He knows when youve been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not pout
You better not cry
Im telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
