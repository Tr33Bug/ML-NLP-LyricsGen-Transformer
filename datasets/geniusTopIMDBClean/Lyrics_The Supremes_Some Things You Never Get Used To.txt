Some things you never get used to
Its the same routine of getting up every morning
And putting on a smile
But underneath theres another person
Who cant find a reason to make living worthwhile
Ah another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and like having you
Ill never get used to
Ive gotten used to not listing
For familiar sounds you used to make
Now Im trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake
Look here its like a childs first step
I have to learn to walk all all over again
Cause you were always there if I should fall
And now theres nobody else that I can call
Its like wanting you and not having you
Ill never get used to
Lost in a cloud
I think I caught a glimpse of you
Blindly I rush to touch your hand huh
To discover its my mind
Playing tricks on me again  Tricks on me again 
Some things you never get used to
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and like having you
Ill never get used to
Its wanting you and like having you
Ill never get used to
Look here like wanting you and like having you
Ill never get used to
