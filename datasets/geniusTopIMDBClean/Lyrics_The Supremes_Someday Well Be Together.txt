Someday well be together
Say say say it say it again
Someday well be together
Oh yeah oh yeah
Youre far away
From me my love
And just as sure my my baby
As there are stars above
I wanna say I wanna say I wanna say
Someday well be together
Yes we will yes we will
Say someday  some sweet day  well be together
I know I know I know I know
My love is yours baby
Oh right from the start
You you you possess my soul now honey
And I know I know you own my heart
And I wanna say
Someday well be together
Some sweet day well be together

Someday  tell everybody now  well be together
Yes we will yes we will
A long time ago my my sweet thing
I made a big mistake honey
I said I said goodbye
Oh oh baby
Ever  ever  ever  ever  ever since that day
Now now all I wanna do is cry cry
Hey hey hey
I long for you every every night
Just to kiss your sweet sweet lips baby
Hold you ever ever so tight
And I wanna say
Someday well be together
Yes we will yes we will
Someday well be together
Yes we will yes we will
Someday well be together
Someday well be together
