Im standing at the crossroads of love
Im standing at the crossroads of love
Dont know which way to go
Dont know which way to turn
Though the love I give is not returned
For that boy
My heart still yearns
So Im standing at the crossroads of love
Cause when Im with him he mistreats me
Runs around and cause me misery
But I love him
I cant deny
And without him
Id surely die
It hurts to be with him
And it hurts to be without him
So Im standing at the crossroads of love
Just standing at the crossroads of love
Dont know which way
Dont know which way to go
Dont know which way
Dont know which way to turn
Theres always tears on my pillow
Cause Im always in the middle
Of heartache and emotion
Heartbreak and devotion
Loving caring when its despairing
Trying to be true
Though it makes me blue
So Im standing at the crossroads of love
Just standing at the crossroads of love
Dont know which way to turn
Dont know which way to turn
Im standing at the crossroads
