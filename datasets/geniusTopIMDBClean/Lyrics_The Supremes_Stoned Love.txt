Now I wanna tell you of a great love
Oh it will light up
It will surely light up
The world
If youll just believe
Stoned love
Stoned love 
Mmhmm

Stoned love
Oh yeah
A love for each other will bring fighting to an end
Forgiving one another time after time doubt creeps in
But like the sun lights up the sky with a message from above
Oh yeah I find no other greater symbol of this love
Yeah dont you hear the wind blowin
Mmhmm
Stoned love oh yeah
I tell you I aint got no other
Mmhmm
Stoned love oh yeah
Life is so short put the present time at hand
Oh yeah and if youre young at heart rise up and take your stand
And to the man on whose shoulder the world must depend
I pray for peace and love amen
Cant you feel it
Stoned love
I tell you I aint got no other
Uhhuh
Stoned love oh yeah
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh  Ooh ooh ooh 
If a war tween our nations passed oh yeah
Will the love tween our brothers and sisters last
On and on and on and on and
Mm mm mm
Stoned love yeah

Cant you cant you cant you cant you cant you feel it
