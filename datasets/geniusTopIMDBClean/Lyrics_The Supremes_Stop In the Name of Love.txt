Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Baby baby Im aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love youll meet
But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
Think it over 
After Ive been good to you
Think it over 
After Ive been sweet to you
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over
Ive known of your your secluded nights
Ive even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection
This time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
Think it over 
Havent I been good to you
Think it over 
Havent I been sweet to you
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over


Ive tried so hard hard to be patient
Hoping youll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
Im so afraid of losing you forever
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart  Baby think it over 
Stop in the name of love  Think it over baby 
Before you break my heart  Ooh think it over baby 
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
