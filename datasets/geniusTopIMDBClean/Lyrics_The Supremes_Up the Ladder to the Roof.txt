Come with me
And we shall run across the sky
And illuminate the night
Oh oh oh I will try and guide you
To better times and brighter days
Dont be afraid
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can see heaven much better
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can be  where we can be 
Closer to heaven  to heaven stay 
Stay with me
And we shall let expression sing
Cant you hear em ring
Oh oh oh memories of yesterday
Yesterdays broken dreams
Dont you know theyll all fade away
If youll come
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can see heaven much better
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can be  where we can be 
Closer to heaven  to heaven stay 
Well laugh and Ill tell you the story of love
How it is and the happiness in it baby
Well combine our thoughts
And together well travel the roads
To the fountain of loveliness
I will never ever ever leave you
Leave you alone to wonder
As we go on our love it will grow  It will grow 
Much stronger and stronger


Ah up the  up the 
Oohooh up the  up the 
Oh come on and walk  walk 
Come on and talk  talk 
Come on and sing about love and understanding
Ooh ooh ooh  up the ladder to the roof 
Ooh ooh ooh  see heaven 
Ooh ooh ooh  go up the ladder to the roof
