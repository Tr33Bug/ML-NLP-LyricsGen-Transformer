He gave me the eye
But I just passed him by
I treated him unkind
But he didnt seem to mind
I told him be on his way
But not a word did he say
He just stood there kind of bold
While I acted cold
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize I should apologize
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh then I knew
That he won my heart
So I quickly apologized
Hoping he hadnt changed his mind
But not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh then I knew
That he won my heart
Oohwa
When he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things hed say
Instead he smiled kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh then I knew
That he won my heart


But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Ooh ooh
