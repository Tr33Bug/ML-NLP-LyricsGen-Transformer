Baby baby
Baby dont leave me
Ooh please dont leave me
All by myself
Ive got this burning burning yearning
Feelin inside me
Ooh deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh you wanna leave me
Ooh baby baby
Where did our love go
Ooh dont you want me
Dont you want me no more
Ooh baby
Baby baby
Where did our love go
And all your promises
Of a love forever more
Ive got this burning burning yearning
Feelin inside me
Ooh deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind
Baby baby  ooh baby
Baby baby
Baby dont leave me
Ooh please dont leave me
All by myself
Ooh baby baby
Where did our love go
