I need love love
To ease my mind
I need to find find
Someone to call mine
But Mama said
You cant hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said Love dont come easy
Its a game of give and take  Cant wait 
You cant hurry love  Ooh until that day 
No you just have to wait
You got to trust give it time  Love dont come easy 
No matter how long it takes
But how many heartaches
Must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin on
When I feel my strength
Yeah is almost gone
I remember Mama said
You cant hurry love 
No you just have to wait
She said Love dont come easy
Its a game of give and take  Cant wait 
How long must I wait  Ooh until that day 
How much more can I take
Before loneliness  Love dont come easy 
Will cause my heart heart to break
No I cant bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I cant go on
These precious words
Keeps me hangin on
I remember Mama said
You cant hurry love 
No you just have to wait
She said Love dont come easy
Its a game of give and take  Cant wait 
You cant hurry love
No you just have to wait  Ooh until that day 
She said Trust give it time  Love dont come easy 
No matter how long it takes
Now break 
No love love
Dont come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting  Cant wait  ooh until that day 
I keep on waiting
But it aint easy  Love dont come easy 
It aint easy but Mama said
You cant hurry love  Ooh until that day 
No you just have to wait
She said Trust give it time  Love dont come easy 
No matter how long it takes
You cant hurry love  Ooh until that day 
No you just have to wait
She said love dont come easy
