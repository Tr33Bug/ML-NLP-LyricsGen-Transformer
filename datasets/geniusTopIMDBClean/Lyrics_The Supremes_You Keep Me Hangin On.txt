Set me free why dontcha baby
Get out my life why dontcha baby
Cause you dont really love me
You just keep me hanging on
You dont really need me
But you keep me hanging on
Why do you keep acoming around
Playing with my heart
Why dont you get out of my life
And let me make a new start
Letting me get over you
The way youve gotten over me hey
Set me free why dont cha baby
Let me be why dont cha baby  Oohwoo ooh 
Cause you dont really love me
You just keep me hanging on  Oohwoo ooh 
Now you dont really want me
You just keep me hanging on
You say although we broke up
You still wanna be just friends
But how can we still be friends
When seeing you only breaks my heart again
And there aint nothin I can do about it
Whoa whoa whoa 
Set me free why dont cha baby
Whoa whoa whoa 
Get out my life why dont cha baby  Oohwoo ooh 
Set me free why dontcha baby
Get out my life why dontcha baby
You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that youve got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You dont want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else heyey
Why dont you be a man about it
And set me free  Oohwoo ooh 
Now you dont care a thing about me
Youre just using me  Oohwoo ooh 
Go on get out get out of my life
And let me sleep at night please  Oohwoo ooh 
Cause you dont really love me
You just keep me hanging on
