When I feel the walls start closing in on me
And I dont like where Ive been to or where Im gonna be
When Im heading hard for hard times
And I know Im nowhere bound
You turn me around you turn me around
You turn me around
You turn me around
round and round round and round 
Mmm when the stray of daily living takes its toll
story of daily living 
And the crazy fears that haunt me begin to chill my soul
And I I dont know what Im fighting
I just know Im losing ground
You turn me around you turn me around
You turn me around
You turn me around
whenever Im with you turns me around 
Just your head on my shoulder  my shoulder 
Just your eyes reaching into mine
Makes a little kid in me grow older
And before I know it Ill step right back in time
And when I see the way the people carry on
When it seems that human kindness is all but dead and gone
Just the sight of you reminds me
Something good can still be found
You turn me around turn me around
Turn me around
Ooh you turn me around
round and round
