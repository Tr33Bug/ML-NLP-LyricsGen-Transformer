Lover of mine
Gone to a faraway land
Serving your country
On some faraway sand
If you should get lonely
Remember that your heart belongs to me
Im sending you a picture
To carry with you all the time
So if youre feeling lonely
Its something to remind you
Im thinking of you constantly  Thinking of you constantly 
Remember that your hearts belongs to me  Your heart belongs to me 
If a pretty girl should pass you by
I wont mind if you give her the eye
Or even if you give her a smile sometimes
But keep your heart because your heart is mine
Your heart is mine your heart is mine
Lover of mine
If I could tell you how I yearn
For the day to come
When you will return
From far across the sea
So remember that your heart belongs to me  Your heart belongs to me 
Remember your heart belongs to me
Youre far across the sea but your heart it belongs  Your heart belongs to me 
It belongs to only me
Lover of mine
