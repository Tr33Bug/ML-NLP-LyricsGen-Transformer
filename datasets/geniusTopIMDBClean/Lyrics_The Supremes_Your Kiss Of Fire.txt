La lalalala la lalalala la
When you first gave it to me  To me 
Your sweet kiss of fire
The burning flame of love
Started mounting higher  Oohoooo 
Til it consumed my heart and soul  And soul 
And like King Midas loved his gold  His gold 
I wanted you alone to hold
And your kiss of fire  And your kiss of fire 
Your sweet kiss of fire  Your sweet kiss of fire 
Your sweet kiss of fire  Your sweet kiss of fire 
And then you took it away  Away 
Your sweet kiss of fire
Taking the thrill out of love
Killing my desire  Oohoooo 
Im like a leaf without a tree  A tree 
Like a fish without the sea  The tree 
Im as cold as cold can be
Without your kiss of fire  Without your kiss of fire 
Your sweet kiss of fire  Your sweet kiss of fire 
Your sweet kiss of fire  Your sweet kiss of fire 
Please dont forsake me
After showing me the way to love
Just come on and make me
Warm as the sun that shines above
Bring it bring it to me
Your sweet kiss of fire
Stop this hurt within me
Bring back my desire  Oohoooo 
Its you that I adore  Adore 
Ill do anything you implore  Implore 
If youll just give to me once more
Your sweet kiss of fire  Your sweet kiss of fire 
Your sweet kiss of fire  Kiss of fire sweet kiss of fire 
Fire oh yeah  Fire fire
