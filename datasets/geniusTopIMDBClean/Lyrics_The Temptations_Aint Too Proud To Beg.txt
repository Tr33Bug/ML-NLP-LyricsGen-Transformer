I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I dont mind cause you mean that much to me
Aint too proud to beg sweet darlin
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
Aint too proud to plead baby baby
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
Now I heard a cryin man is half a man
With no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you I dont mind weepin
If itll keep you by my side
Aint too proud to beg sweet darlin
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
Aint too proud to plead baby baby
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin away
Let your friends laugh even this I can stand
Cause I want to keep you any way I can
Aint too proud to beg sweet darlin
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
Aint too proud to plead baby baby
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
Now Ive got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
Im not ashamed to come and plead to you baby
If pleadin keeps you from walkin out of that door
Aint too proud to beg sweet darlin
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
Aint too proud to plead baby baby
Please dont leave me girl dont you go
Baby baby baby  Ooh sweet darlin 
Please dont leave me
