I need you
Oh oh I need you
Baby baby baby dont you know
That I need you  so   so   so   so 
I want you
Oh oh I want you
Baby baby baby dont you know
That I want you  so   so   so   so 
You knew my lips were lonely for the kisses you could give to me
Ever since the first day baby that we met
So if you say youre mine and let our hearts combine
I swear Ill never let you forget how much
I love you
Oh oh I love you
Baby baby baby dont you know
That I love you  so   so   so   so 
I need you
Oh oh I want you
Baby baby baby

Come home come home come home come home

Hey baby
Come home come home come home come home
Come home come home come home come home
