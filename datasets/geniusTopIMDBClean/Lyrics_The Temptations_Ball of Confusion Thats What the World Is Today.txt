Ball of Confusion  Thats What the World Is Today  Lyrics
One two
One two three four ow
People movin out people movin in
Why Because of the color of their skin
Run run run but you sure cant hide
An eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and Ill set you free
Rap on brother rap on
Well the only person talkin bout Love thy brother
Is the preacher
And it seems nobodys interested in learnin
But the teacher
Segregation determination demonstration integration Aggravation humiliation obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion
Oh yeah
Thats what the world is today
Woo hey hey
The sale of pills are at an alltime high
Young folks walkin round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on
Evolution revolution gun control the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon kids growin up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So round and around and around we go
Where the worlds headed said nobody knows
Oh Great Googa Mooga
Cant you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah thats what the world is today
Woo hey hey
Fear in the air tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new records a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction tax deduction
City inspectors bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand population out of hand
Suicide too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting End the war
And the band played on
Great Googa Mooga
Cant you hear me talking to you
Its a ball of confusion
Thats what the world is today hey hey
Let me hear ya let me hear ya let me hear ya
Sayin ball of confusion
Thats what the world is today hey hey  Let me hear ya let me hear ya let me hear ya let me hear ya let me hear ya 
Sayin ball of confusion
Thats what the world is today
