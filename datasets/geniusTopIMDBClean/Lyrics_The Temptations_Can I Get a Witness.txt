Listen everybody especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
When the one you love is never home
And I love too hard my friends sometimes say
But I believe I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see yall treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it aint fair
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness 
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness 
Somebody somebody
Can I get a witness 
Is it right to be treated so bad
When youve given everything you had
Even tossin in my sleep
Cause I havent seen my baby all week
Now you chicks do agree
That this aint the way loves supposed to be
Then emme hear lemme hear you say Yeah hey
Up early in the mornin
With her on my mind
Just to find out all night that Ive been cryin
Cause I believe  I believe  a woman is a mans best friend
Im gonna stick by her right here right now
Til the very end
But she caused me so much misery
That I forget how loves supposed to be
Lemme hear you lemme hear you say Hey hey


I want a witness
I want a witness 
Can I get a witness
Witness witness 
I want a witness
I want a witness 
Can I get a witness
Witness witness 
Everybody knows especially you girls
That love can be sad
But I have a love thats twice as bad
All you chicks agree
That this aint the way loves supposed to be
Lemme hear you lemme hear you say Yeah hey
