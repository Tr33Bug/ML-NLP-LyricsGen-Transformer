The childhood part of my life
It wasnt very pretty
You see I was born and raised
In the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept
Ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food
Or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease
My troubled mind
Mmm listen
My father didnt know
The meaning of work
He disrespected Mama
And treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job
That I never did find
Depressed and downhearted
I took to Cloud Nine
Im doing fine
Up here on Cloud Nine
Listen one more time
Im doing fine
Up here on Cloud Nine
Folks down there tell me
They say Give yourself a chance son
Dont let life pass you by
But the world of reality is a rat race
Where only the strongest survive
Its a dogeatdog world
And that aint no lie
Listen it aint even safe no more
To walk the streets at night

Im doing fine on Cloud Nine
Let me tell you about Cloud Nine
Cloud Nine 
You can be what you wanna be
Cloud Nine 
You aint got no responsibility
Cloud Nine 
And every man every man is free
Cloud Nine 
And youre a million miles from reality
Reality  I wanna sail upper higher
Upper up up and away
Cloud Nine
I wanna say I love the life I live
And Im gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud Nine
IIIII Im riding high
On Cloud Nine 
Youre as free as a bird in flight
Cloud Nine 
Theres no difference between day and night
Cloud Nine 
Its a world of love and harmony
Cloud Nine 
Youre a million miles from reality
Reality  I wanna sail upper higher
Upper up up and away
Cloud Nine 
You can be what you wanna be
Cloud Nine 
You aint got no responsibility
Cloud Nine 
Every man in his mind is free
Cloud Nine 
Youre a million miles from reality
Cloud Nine 
You can be what you wanna be
