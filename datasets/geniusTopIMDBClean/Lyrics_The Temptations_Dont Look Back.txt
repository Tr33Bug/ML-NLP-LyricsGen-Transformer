If its love that youre running from theres no hiding place
You cant run you cant hide you cant run you cant hide 
Love has problems I know but theyre problems well just have to face
Oh yeah yeah
If you just put your hand in mine
Were gonna leave all our troubles behind
Were gonna walk and dont look back  Dont look back 
And dont look back  Dont look back  oh yeah yeah
And dont look back baby  Dont look back 
The past is behind you dont let them remind you 
If your first lover broke your heart
Theres something that can be done
You dont run you dont hide you dont run you dont hide 
Dont end your faith in love because of what hes done
So if you just put your hand in mine
Were gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking dont look back  Dont look back 
Forget about the past now
Dont look back baby  Dont look back 
Keep on walking and dont look back mmm  Dont look back 
The past behind you dont let them remind you 
Love can be a beautiful thing
Though your first love let you down
Oh yeah yeah
You dont run you dont hide you dont run you dont hide 
Cause I know we can make love bloom baby
The second time around
Oh yeah yeah
So if you just put your hand in mine
Were gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on pushing and dont look back  Dont look back 
Now whatd I say we wont look back girl  Dont look back 
Keep on walking and wont look back
Forget about the past now baby  Dont look back 
And dont look back  Dont look back
