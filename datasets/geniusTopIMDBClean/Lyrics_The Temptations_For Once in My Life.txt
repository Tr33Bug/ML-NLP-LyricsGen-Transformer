For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
Somehow I know Ill be strong
For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Ah someone like you
Would make my dream come true
For once in my life
I wont let sorrow hurt me
Not like its hurt me before
For once I have something
I know wont desert me
Im not alone anymore
For once I can say
This is mine you cant take it
As long as I know
I have love I can make it
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
For once I can say
This is mine you cant take it
Long as I know
I have love I can make it
For once I can feel
That somebody heard my plea
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
For once in my life
In my life
