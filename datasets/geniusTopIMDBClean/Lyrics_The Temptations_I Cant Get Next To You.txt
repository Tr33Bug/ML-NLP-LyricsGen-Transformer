Hold it everybody
Hold it hold it
Listen 
I can turn the greyest sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail high on dry land
But my life is incomplete and Im so blue
Cause I cant get next to you  I cant get next to you babe 
Next to you  I cant get next to you 
I just cant get next you  I cant get next to you babe 
I cant get next to you 
I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey and I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire
Unimportant are all the things I can do
Cause I cant get next to you  I cant get next to you babe 
No matter what I do  I cant get next to you 
Uhyah
Ooh
Ooh
Chicka boom chicka boom
Chicka boom boom boom
I can turn back the hands of time you better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most Im unable to do
Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
Cause girl youre the key to my happiness
And I oh I cant get next to you
Girl youre blowing my mind
Cause I cant get  next to you 
Cant you see these tears Im crying
I cant get  next to you 
Girl its you that I need
I gotta get  next to you 
Cant you see these tears Im crying
I cant get  next to you 
I I I I I cant get  next to you 
I I I I I cant get now  next to you 
Girl youre blowing my mind
Cause I cant get
