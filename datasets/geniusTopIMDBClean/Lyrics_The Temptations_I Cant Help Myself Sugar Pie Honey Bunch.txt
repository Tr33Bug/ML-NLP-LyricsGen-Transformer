I Cant Help Myself  Sugar Pie Honey Bunch  LyricsSugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I cant help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
Come and you go
Leavin just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye I comea runnin to you
Im tied to your apron string
And theres nothing that I can do
Cant help myself
No I cant help myself
Coz sugarpie honeybunch
Weaker than a man should be
I cant help myself
Im a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I dont love you
Tell you that were through and Ive tried
But every time I see your face
I get up all choked up inside
When I call your name
Girl it starts the flame
Burnin in my heart tearin it all apart
No matter how I try my love I cannot hide
Coz sugarpie honeybunch
You know that Im weak for you
Cant help myself
I love you and nobody else
Sugarpie honeybunch
Do anything you ask me to
Cant help myself
I want you and nobody else

Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
Cant help myself
No I cant help myself
