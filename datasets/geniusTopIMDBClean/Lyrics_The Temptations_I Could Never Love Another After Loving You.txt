I Could Never Love Another  After Loving You  Lyrics
Girl I cant believe my ears
Are you really telling me goodbye
See youre taking away my reason for living
And you wont even tell me why
Before you walk out the door
Theres something I want you to know
That I could never ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
I could never love another 
Cause none can compare
After loving you
It was only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
Baby you said long as the rivers flow
Each day youd love me more
Now you wanna leave me behind
Listen baby
I dont know what its gonna take to make you stay
I just know Ive got to find a way
Cause I could never never never ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other will I share
I could never love another 
Cause none none can compare
After loving you
So baby please stay beside me
I need your sweet love to guide me
Oh baby baby baby baby baby baby
I could never love another 
Ooh after loving you
I could never love another after loving you 
Baby baby baby it was only only only only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
I remember you said
Long as the rivers flow
Each day youd love me more
Now you wanna leave leave me behind
Listen baby
I dont know what its gonna take to make you stay
I just know Ive got to find a way
I could never never never never ever love another after loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
I could never love another 
Cause none none can compare
After loving you
Ooh baby on my bended knees Im beggin you to stay here with me
