I Know  Im Losing You Lyrics
Ooh
Your love is fading I can feel your love fading
Girl its fading away from me
Cause your touch your touch has grown cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
Ive fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man
Its there when you speak my name
Its just not the same
Ooh baby Im losing you
Its in the air
Its everywhere
Ooh baby Im losing you
Losing you 
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
Im hurt downhearted and worried girl
Cause that face doesnt belong to me
Oh its all over your face
Someones taken my place
Woo ooh baby Im losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness inside
Ooh I can tell Im losing you
Ooh  Losing you 
I dont wanna lose you
Ooh I can tell when we kiss
From the tenderness I miss
Ooh little girl Im losing you
Girl I can feel it in my bones
Any day youll be gone
Oh baby Im losing you

Oh my dear
What happened to the love we shared
Oh baby Im losing you
I know its true
Theres someone new
Oh baby baby baby Im losing you
