Sunshine blue skies please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain  Oh how I wish that it would rain 
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Cause so badly I wanna go outside  Such a lovely day 
But everyone knows that a man aint supposed to cry
Listen I gotta cry cause crying eases the pain oh yeah
People this hurt I feel inside words could never explain
I just wish it would rain  Oh how I wish that it would rain 
Oh let it rain rain rain rain  Oh how I wish that it would rain 
Ooh baby let it rain  Let it rain 
Oh yeah let it rain
Day in day out my tearstained face
Pressed against the windowpane
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know that Im crying  Crying crying crying 
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
Oh I wish it would rain  Oh how I wish that it would rain 
Ooh baby let it rain let it rain  Let it rain let it rain 
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes  Rain rain rain let it rain 
Oh let it rain  Doo doo doo doo 


Oh yeah yeah listen  Let it rain let it rain 
Im a man and I got my pride  Rain rain rain rain let it rain 
Til it rains Im gonna stay inside  Doo doo doo doo 
Let it rain  Let it rain let it rain
