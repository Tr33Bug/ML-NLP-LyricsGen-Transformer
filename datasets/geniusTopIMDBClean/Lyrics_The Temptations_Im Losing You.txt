Your love is fadin I feel it fade
Ah your love is fadin I feel it fade
Ah your love is fadin Baby I feel it fade
Ahyour touch your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
Ive fooled myself long as I can
Can feel the presence of somebody elses hands
Its there when you speak my name
Its just not the same
Ooh babe Im losing you
Its in the air
Its there everywhere
Baby baby babe Im Losing you
When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
Im hurt downhearted and worried
Cause that face doesnt belong to me
Its all over your face
Someones takin my place
Ooo baby Im losing you
You try hard to hide
The emptiness you feel inside
Oo babe Im losing you
I cant bear the thought of losing you
Ah Baby cant you see what Im goin through
Im losin my mind  losin my mind 
And its all because of you
I cant bear the thought of losing you
Im losin my mind  losin my mind 
And Its all because of you
I cant stand the thought of losing you
