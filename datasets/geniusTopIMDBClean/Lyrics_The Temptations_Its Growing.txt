Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill
Its growing
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel
Its growing
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun
Its growing
Like the tale by the time its been told by more than one hoo
Its growing
Every day it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh how it grows and it grows
And where its gonna stop Im sure nobody knows
Hey hey hey nobody knows 
How it grows and it grows and it grows
Nobody knows  Woo yeah yeah yeah yeah
Nobody knows it grows it grows where is it gonna stop 
Woo like a need in a guy to see his girl
When shes gone away its growing
Like the sadness in his little heart
When he knows that shes gone to stay woo its growing
Every day it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh how it grows and it grows
And where its gonna stop Im sure nobody knows
Hey hey hey nobody knows  It gets a little wider
Nobody knows  Oh it gets a little stronger
Hey hey hey  The feeling for each kiss baby
Hey hey hey  Oh it lasts a little longer yeah
Hey hey hey  Ooh so much ooh so much
Cant you see its growing baby
It grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
