Just My Imagination  Running Away with Me  Lyrics
Oooh
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself Youre such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
Out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to you
But it was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
It was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Ooh  Soon 
Soon well be married and raise a family  Oh yeah 
A cozy little home out in the country
With two children maybe three
I tell you I  I I  can visualize it all
This couldnt be a dream for too real it all seems
But it was just my imagination once again
Runnin away with me
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Evry night on my knees I pray
Dear Lord hear my plea
Dont ever let another take her love from me
Or I will surely die hmm
Her love is  heavenly
When her arms enfold me
I hear a tender rhapsody
But in reality
She doesnt even know me
Just my imagination  Once again
Runnin away with me oh
Tell you it was just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Ive never met her but I cant forget her
Just my imagination  Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Runnin away with me ooh
Just my imagination
Runnin away with me
Shes never hard to find  Just my imagination 
Shes always on my mind  Runnin away with me
