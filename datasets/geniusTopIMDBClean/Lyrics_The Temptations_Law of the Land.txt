Some people will always have it made
Some people will live in poverty for the rest of their days
Time marches on
Yesterday is dead and gone
Life is uncertain let me hear you say  Yeah 
Death is final yes it is
Therell be days of sunshine and laughter
But dont forget you gonna have to shed some tears oh ho

Whether you like it or youll understand  Ah hey hey 
Its the law of the land  Hey hey hey hey 
Laws made by almighty man
Live by the good book if youre able
You must play your cards on top of the table

For your own protection your doors you must lock
