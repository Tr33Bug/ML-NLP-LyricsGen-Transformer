Money I aint got none
Where I was born everything was dull and dingy 
Job cant find one
I lived in a place they called the inner city
The streets raised me from a baby
Getting ahead huh was strictly a nono
Cause nobody cares what happens to folks that live in the ghetto 
Thousand of lives wasting away
People living from day to day
This is a challenge just staying alive
Cause in the ghetto only the strong survives
Broken down homes kids strung out
They dont even know what lifes all about
Stealin cars robbin bars
Muggin drugs ratinfested and no ones interested
Kids dodgin cars for recreation
Only adds to a mothers frustration
Breakins folks comin home and findin all their possessions gone
Oh ho
Its an every day thing  well well  in the ghetto
Its an every day thing in the ghetto
