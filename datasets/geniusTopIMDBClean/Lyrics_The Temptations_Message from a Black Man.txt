Yes my skin is black
But thats no reason to hold me back
Why dont you think about it think about it
Think about it think about it
Think about it think about it think about it
I have wants and desires just like you
So move on aside cause Im a comin through
Oh no matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
Yes your skin is white
Does that make you right
Why dont you think about it think about it
Think about it think about it
Think about it think about it think about it
This is a message a message to yall
Together we stand divided we fall
Black is a color just like white
Tell me how can a color determine whether
Youre wrong or right
We all have our faults yes we do
So look in your mirror  Look in your mirror 
What do you see  What do you see 
Two eyes  Two eyes  a nose  a nose 
And a mouth just like me
Oh your eyes are open but you refuse to see
The laws of society were made for both you and me
Because of my color I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But in the end youre gonna see my friend
Oh no matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
Were rollin rollin rollin were rollin on 
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
Oh were rollin rollin rollin rollin on 
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
Cant stop me cant stop me 
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
No matter how hard you try you cant stop me now
