Whose hairstyles are out of this world
Whether its straight or bouffant or its curled
My baby  My baby my baby  hey hey hey
My baby baby pretty baby
Hair soft like a baby lamb and I love to run my fingers through it
I hope she digs me the way I am but if I have to change
You know Im gonna do it for my baby
Im gonna do it for my baby 
Personality contains more gold
Than any bank in this world could hold
My baby  My baby my baby  hey hey hey
My baby baby pretty baby
Enough gold in her personality to set Fort Knox to shame
This golden girl belongs to me
Let nobody try to stake his claim
Stake his claim on my baby 
My baby  Shes cute as can be
My baby  This girls got a hold on me
My baby  Has a kiss so sweet it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete
Oh yeah shes my baby
Oh yeah shes my baby
And I love her so
Yeah I love my baby so
My baby  Shes cute as can be
My baby  The girls got a hold on me
My baby  Has a kiss so sweet it knocks me off my feet
She makes my life complete


Who has my mind in a kind of a haze
Who has me walkin around in a daze
My baby  My baby my baby  hey hey hey
My baby baby pretty baby
She gives me a feeling I cant explain
She sets my soul on fire
But I dont feel hurt and I dont feel pain
All I feel is a strong desire for my baby
Strong desire for my baby 
Oh yeah my baby got personality to satisfy me
Oh baby thats my baby my baby my baby
