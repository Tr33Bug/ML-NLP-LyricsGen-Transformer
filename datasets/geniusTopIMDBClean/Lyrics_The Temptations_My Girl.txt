Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day
When its cold outside Ive got the month of May
I guess youd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl my girl my girl
Talkin bout my girl my girl
Ive got so much honey the bees envy me
Ive got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well I guess youd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl my girl my girl
Talkin bout my girl my girl
Ooh ooh
Hey hey hey
Ooh ooh
Hey hey hey
Ooh ooh yeah
I dont need no money fortune or fame
Ive got all the riches baby one man can claim
Well I guess youd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl my girl my girl
Talkin bout my girl my girl
Talkin bout my girl 
Ive got sunshine on a cloudy day  Woah woah 
With my girl
Ive even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin bout talkin bout talkin bout my girl
Ooh my girl
Thats all I can talk about is my girl
Why dont you believe shes all my girl
