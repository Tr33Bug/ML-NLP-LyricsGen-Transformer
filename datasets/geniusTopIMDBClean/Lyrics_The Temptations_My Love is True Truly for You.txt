When will you learn

My Love is true  Only for you

No matter where your heart may roam
Deep down inside of me baby yeah

If ever a story should be told
Whatever time may unfold
Let it be said girl I always loved you
You can count on me baby
Cause my love is true

But theres one thing that will remain the same
