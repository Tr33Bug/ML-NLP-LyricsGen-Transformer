My Love is True  Truly for You  Lyrics
When will you learn

Please open your eyes and see
Youre the only one for me baby
Of all the things weve been through
Its made my love strong for you
We all need someone to depend on

Weve been blessed to have this love affair
I cant let go go nowhere
Blessing comes in many disguises
Im so glad I recognize it
Youre something special and very rare
What we got baby you dont fine anywhere
My Love is true  Only for you

My Love is true  Oh baby 
Truly truly truly for you
So girl take my love

No matter where your heart may roam
Deep down inside of me baby yeah
Your love will always have a home
If ever a story should be told
Whatever time may unfold
Let it be said girl I always loved you
You can count on me baby
Cause my love is true
My love is true

Yes I know that time bring by a change
But theres one thing that will remain the same
And thats how I truly truly love you
Youre my world youre my girl youre my all and all and all
Youre my pot of gold
At the end of loves rainbow
And I couldnt dream of coming home
At the end of the day and you not be there
