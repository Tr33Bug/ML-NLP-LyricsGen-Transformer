You know there is Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid an Donner and Blitzen
Oh but do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all
Whoaoooo
His name is
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other other other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas eve 
You know  Santa came to say 
Hey Rudolph 
You with your nose so bright
Come on come on come on come on and guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee  Hey Rudolph 
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer
Youll go down in history
Then one foggy Christmas eve 
Santa came to say
Hey Rudolph 
You with your nose so bright
Come on come on come on come on and guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee  Hey Rudolph 
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer
Youll go down in history

Ooo Rudolph come on and guide my sleigh
Ooo Rudolph come on and guide my sleigh
Hey hey hey Rudolph come on and guide my sleigh tonight
Hey hey hey Rudolph with your nose so bright
