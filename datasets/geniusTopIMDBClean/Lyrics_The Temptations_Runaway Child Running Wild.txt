You played hooky from school
And you cant go out to play yeah
Mama said for the rest of the week
In your room you gotta stay yeah
Now you feel like the whole worlds pickin on you
Now you feel like the whole worlds pickin on you 
But deep down inside you know it aint true
Youve been punished cause your mother
Wants to raise you the right way yeah
But you dont care
Cause you already made up your mind
You want to run away yeah
Youre on your way
Run away child running wild
Run away child running wild 
Better come back home
Better come back home 
Where you belong
Where you belong 
Roaming through the city
Going nowhere fast
Youre on your own at last
Hey its getting late where will you sleep
Gettin kinda hungry
You forgot to bring something to eat
Oh lost with no money you start to cry
But remember you left home
Wanting to be grown
So dry your weepin eyes
Siren screamin down neon light is flickin
You want your mama
Ah theres nothing for you
Youre frightened and confused
I want my mama
But shes much too far away
She cant hear a word you say
You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents dont see them no more
You want to hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you dont know which way to go

Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
How you long to hear your mothers voice
Cause youre lost and alone
But remember you make the choice oh
Runaway child running wild
Better go back home where you belong hey hey hey
Run away child running wild
Better go back home where you belong
Youre lost in this great big city
Go back home where you belong 
Not one familiar face aint it a pity
Go back home where you belong 
Oh runaway child running wild
You better go back home where you belong oh yeah
Mama mama please come and see about me
Oh but shes much too far away
She cant hear a word you say
I want my mama
Oh youre frightened and confused
Which way will you choose
