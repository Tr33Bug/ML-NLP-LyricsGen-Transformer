Lady Luck and four leaf clovers
Wont ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
Til you leavin left me this situation
Oh ho ho 
Im standin on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standin on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Waaa
My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I havent seen in years
Girl you better throw me a life preserver
Cause Im about to drown in my own tears
Ah ha ah 
Im standin on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standin on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Ooh hoo
Now now now
Standin on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down wow
Said Im standin on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down whoo hoo
Standin on shakey ground 
Standin well
Ever since you put me down 
On shakey ground
Standin standin standing on shakey ground waa
Got to say it got to say it got to say it got to say it
Im standin on shakey ground woo
Ever since you put me down and ah ha
Standin on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
