Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse
In my mind I want you to be free
For all of our friends
Would you listen to me
Now hear what I say
We wish you a Merry Christmas  Merry Christmas 
To each  To all of you  one of you
Mhm
Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep sleep in heaven heavenly peace
Go on and rest your mind
And sleep
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born oh yes
Christ  Christ  Christ  Christ the Savior  the Savior is born
What a joyous day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Silent night  As I sit around by the fireplace 
Holy night  Watching the gleaming tree 
All is calm  If I had one wish in this world 
All is bright  It would be that all men would be free 
Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Ooh lets celebrate the Savior lets give thanks unto the world 
Holy Infant so tender and mild  Jesus is born 
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep  Sleep  sleep in heaven heavenly peace

Just sleep and relax your mind
To all our family and friends
I want you to remember this line  Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas  To all of you 
And we mean it Merry  Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas  To all of you 
Merry Christmas from The Temptations
