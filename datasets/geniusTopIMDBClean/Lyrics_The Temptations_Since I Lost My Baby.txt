The sun is shining  Oh yeah 
Theres plenty of light
A new day is dawning
Sunny and bright
But after Ive been crying all night
The sun is cold
And the new day seems old
Since I lost my baby
Since I lost my baby 
Oh since I lost my baby
Since I lost my baby 
The birds are singing
And the children are playing  Doodoodoo 
Theres plenty of work
And the bosses are paying
Not a sad word should
A young heart be saying
But fun is a bore
And with money Im poor
Since I lost my baby
Since I lost my baby 
Oh since I lost my baby
Since I lost my baby 
Next time Ill be kinder
Next time Ill be kinder 
Wont you please help me find her
Wont you please help me find her 
Someone just remind her
Someone just remind her 
Of this love she left behind her
Of this love she left behind her 
Til I find her Ill be trying
Til I find her Ill be trying 
Every day Im more inclined to find her
Inclined to find her
Inclined to find my baby 
Been looking everywhere  Baby 
Baby I really really care
Oh determination is fading fast  Oh yeah 
Inspiration is a thing of the past  Oh yeah 
Cant see how my hopes gonna last
Good things are bad
And whats happy is sad
Since I lost my baby
Since I lost my baby 
Oh since I lost my baby
Since I lost my baby 
I feel so bad  Since I lost my baby 
I feel so sad  Since I lost my baby 
Everything is wrong  Since I lost my baby 
This heart is hard to carry on  Since I lost my baby 
Im lost as can be  Since I lost my baby 
Whats gonna happen to me
