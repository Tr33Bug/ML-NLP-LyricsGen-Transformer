Oh whoa whoa  Soul to soul 
Piece of newspaper at my feet
We go blowing down the street
Got our stories old and new
Need someone to tell em to
We dont have to be eye to eye  Face to face 
Im not asking for miracles  Nor saving grace 
And I dont need another heart  To have and hold 
All I want is a friend I can talk to  Soul to soul 
Oh soul to soul  Soul to soul 
Mmm oh yeah
Like a notebook on a shelf
Tired of talking to myself
Im wishing somebody  Somebody  passing by  Passing by 
Would pick me up and look inside
We dont have to be eye to eye  Or face to face 
Im not asking for miracles  Miracles   Or saving grace 
And I dont need another heart
I dont need another heart   To have and hold 
All I want is a friend I can talk to  Soul to soul 
Soul to soul  Oh soul to soul   Soul to soul 
Mmm
Everyone needs someone to turn to
When they walk in their line  Got to walk that line 
And we all need a friend we can cry to
And Im out on that line  Im on that line

Oh whoa whoa whoa
