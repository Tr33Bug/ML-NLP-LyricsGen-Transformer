Superstar  Remember How You Got Where You Are  Lyrics
Higher higher
Fire
Dont change your style now that youve reached the top
Dont choose your friends by what theyve got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people youre just a human being
Superstar good God
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
And your chauffeur driven fancy car
But remember how you got where you are
Oh ho ho cause the same folks that made you
Mhm you better believe they can break you
No you didnt make it all by yourself
You had help from somebody else
The truth is the light dont let it depress you
You just be thankful that the good Lord made you
Superstar ah do you know who your real friends are
Im talkin to you
Superstar remember how you got where you are
Ah ah down down down down
Drummer keep it going going
Horns starts blowin
Right on time blow my mind
Higher higher higher higher
Its easy for you to look down
Turn up your nose and frown
Now that youre on top  Top 
Bright lights 
Dont let the bright lights blind you
Bridges 
Dont burn em behind you


Superstar good God do you know who your real friends are
Im talkin to you
Superstar remember how you got where you are
Dont change your style now that youve reached the top
Dont choose your friends by what theyve got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people youre just a human being
Superstar good God do you know who your real friends are
Im talkin to you
Superstar remember how you got where you are
