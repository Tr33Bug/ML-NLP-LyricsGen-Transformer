Youve got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
Im holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume
Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do the way you do the things you do
As pretty as you are  Hoohoo 
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute  Hoohoo 
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart  Hoohoo 
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby youre so smart  Hoohoo 
You know you could have been a schoolbook
Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do the way you do the things you do
You made my heart so rich  Hoohoo 
You know you could have been some money
And baby youre so sweet  Hoohoo 
You know you could have been some honey
Well you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do the way you do the things you do
You really swept me off my feet  The way you do the things you do 
You made my life complete  The way you do the things you do 
You made my life so bright  The way you do the things you do 
You make me feel alright  The way you do the things you do 
You make me feel alright  The way you do the things you do 
You make me feel alright  The way you do the things you do
