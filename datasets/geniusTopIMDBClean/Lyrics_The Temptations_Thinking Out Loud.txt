You know when I first heard this song
The lyrics the melody the way it was being sung
I said man thats the lady I need to go out and find
A lady that will stay with you through the transition of time
The yes the nos the maybe sos
Come on Temptations lets sing this song
When your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you till were seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twentythree
And Im thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old its evergreen
And baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
And Im thinking about how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe its all part of a plan
Well Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
So baby now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
So baby now take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling place your head on my beating heart Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
