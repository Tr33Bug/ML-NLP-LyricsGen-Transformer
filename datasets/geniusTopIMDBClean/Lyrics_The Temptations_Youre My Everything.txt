You surely must know magic girl
Because you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
You made it sunny and bright
Now I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
Youre everything good girl
And youre all that matters to me
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I could see girl
Just knowin your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closin in on me girl
I was blessed the day I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
Youre everything good girl
And youre all that matters to me
Baby youre part of every thought I think each day
Your name is in every phrase my lips say
Every dream I dream is about you
Honey I couldnt live without you

In every love song I sing

Gonna build my whole world around you
