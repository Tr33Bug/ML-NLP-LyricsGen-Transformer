Translations
One two three
If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never
All the people are dancing and theyre having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
But if you close the door
Id never have to see the day again
If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the wineglass out
And drink a toast to never
Oh someday I know someone will look into my eyes
And say hello youre my very special one
But if you close the door
Id never have to see the day again
Dark party bars shiny Cadillac cars
And the people on subways and trains
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
Oh but people look well in the dark
And If you close the door
The night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out
And say hello to never
All the people are dancing and theyre having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
Cause if you close the door
Id never have to see the day again
Id never have to see the day again once more
Id never have to see the day again
