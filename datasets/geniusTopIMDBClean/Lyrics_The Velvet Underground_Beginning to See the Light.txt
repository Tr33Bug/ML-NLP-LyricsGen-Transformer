Beginning to See the Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Some people work very hard
But still they never get it right
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Want to tell all you people now

[Verse 2]
Now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
Wine in the morning and some breakfast at night
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
[Bridge]
Here we go again, playing the fool again
Here we go again, acting hard again, alright

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
I want to tell you, woo hoo ooh
Hey now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
Because it's softer now
I wore my teeth in my hands
So I could mess the hair of the night
Hey, well, I'm beginning to see the light

[Verse 4]
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Baby, I'm beginning to see the light, now
It's kinda softer
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
I met myself in a dream
And I just want to tell you, everything was alright
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light

[Bridge]
Here comes two of you
Which one will you choose?
One is black and one is blue
Don't know just what to do, alright

Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Alright, here she comes
Yeah, yeah, baby, I'm beginning to see the light, ohh
Some people work very hard
But still they never get it right
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Oh, it's getting little softer in here now

[Verse 6]
Now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
Oh, it's coming 'round again
Hey, now, now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light
One more time
There are problems in these times
But, ooh, none of them are mine
Oh, baby, I'm beginning to see the light

[Bridge]
Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend
Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend

[Outro]
How does it feel to be loved?
How does it feel to be loved?
How does it feel to be loved? Ah!
How does it feel to be loved?
How does it feel to be loved?
How does it feel to be loved?3Embed
