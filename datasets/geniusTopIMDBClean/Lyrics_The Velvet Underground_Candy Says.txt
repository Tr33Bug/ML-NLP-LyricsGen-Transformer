Candy says Ive come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world
Candy says Id like to know completely
What others so discreetly talk about
Im going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
Im going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when Im older
What do you think Id see
If I could walk away from me
Candy says I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be
Candy says I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind
Im going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
Im going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when Im older
What do you think Id see
If I could walk away from me
Doo doowop
Doo doo doowop
Doo doo doowop
Doo dooroo doowop
Doo doo doowop
Doo
