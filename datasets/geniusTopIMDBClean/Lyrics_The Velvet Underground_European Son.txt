European Son Lyrics[Verse 1]
You killed your European son
You spit on those under twenty-one
But now your blue cars are gone
You better say so long
Hey hey hey, bye bye bye

[Verse 2]
You made your wallpapers green
You want to make love to the scene
Your European son is gone
You'd better say so long
Your clowns bid you goodbye
