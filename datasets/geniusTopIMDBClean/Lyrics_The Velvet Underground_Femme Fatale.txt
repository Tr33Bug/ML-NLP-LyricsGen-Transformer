Here she comes
You better watch your step
Shes going to break your heart in two its true
Its not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
Shell build you up to just put you down what a clown
Cause everybody knows  Shes a femme fatale 
The things she does to please  Shes a femme fatale 
Shes just a little tease  Shes a femme fatale 
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
Youre written in her book
Youre number thirtyseven have a look
Shes going to smile to make you frown what a clown
Little boy shes from the street
Before you start youre already beat
Shes going to play you for a fool yes its true
Cause everybody knows  Shes a femme fatale 
The things she does to please  Shes a femme fatale 
Shes just a little tease  Shes a femme fatale 
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
Cause everybody knows  Shes a femme fatale 
The things she does to please  Shes a femme fatale 
Shes just a little tease  Shes a femme fatale 
Oh whoa whoa  Shes a femme fatale 
Oh whoa whoa  Shes a femme fatale 
Oh whoa whoa  Shes a femme fatale
