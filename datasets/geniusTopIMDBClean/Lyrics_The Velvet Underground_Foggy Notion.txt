Here we go rolling on one
Shes over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder harder harder
Til they thought she might die
Well I got a foggy notion do it again
Over by the corner do it again
I got my calamine lotion baby do it again
Well I got a foggy notion do it again
She made me do something that I never did before
I rushed right down to a flower store
I bought her a bundle a beautiful batch
Dont you know something
She sent em right back alright
Sally Mae Sally Mae
Sally Mae Sally Mae
Sally Mae Sally Mae
