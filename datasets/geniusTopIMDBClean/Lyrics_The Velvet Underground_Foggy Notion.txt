Here we go rolling on one
Shes over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder harder harder
Til they thought she might die
Well I got a foggy notion do it again
Over by the corner do it again
I got my calamine lotion baby do it again
Well I got a foggy notion do it again
She made me do something that I never did before
I rushed right down to a flower store
I bought her a bundle a beautiful batch
Dont you know something
She sent em right back alright
Sally Mae Sally Mae
Sally Mae Sally Mae
Sally Mae Sally Mae
Sally Mae Sally Mae

Made me do something that I never did before
