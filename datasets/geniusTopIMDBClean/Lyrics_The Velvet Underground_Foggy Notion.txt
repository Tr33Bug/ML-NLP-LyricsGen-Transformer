Foggy Notion Lyrics[Intro]
Here we go, rolling on one

[Verse]
She's over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder, harder, harder
'Til they thought she might die

[Chorus]
Well, I got a foggy notion, do it again
Over by the corner, do it again
I got my calamine lotion, baby, do it again
Well, I got a foggy notion, do it again
[Refrain]
She made me do something that I never did before
I rushed right down to a flower store
I bought her a bundle, a beautiful batch
Don't you know something?
She sent 'em right back, alright
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Alright

[Verse]
She's over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder, harder, harder
Well, they thought she might die

[Chorus]
Well, I got a foggy notion, do it again
Over in the corner, do it again
I got my calamine lotion, do it again
Baby, I got a foggy notion, do it again

[Refrain]
Made me do something that I never did before
I rushed right down to a flower store
I bought her a bundle, a beautiful batch
Now, baby, don't you know something?
She sent 'em right back
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae
