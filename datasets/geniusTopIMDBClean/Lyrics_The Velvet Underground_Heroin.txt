I dont know just where Im goin
But Im gonna try for the kingdom if I can
Cause it makes me feel like Im a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I tell you things arent quite the same
When Im rushin on my run
And I feel just like Jesus son
And I guess that I just dont know
And I guess that I just dont know
I have made big decision
Im gonna try to nullify my life
Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the droppers neck
When Im closin in on death
You cant help me not you guys
Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess I just dont know
And I guess that I just dont know
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that Id sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Goin from this land here to that
On a sailors suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
Of all the evils of this town
And of himself and those around
Oh and I guess that I just dont know
Oh and I guess that I just dont know
Heroin be the death of me
Heroin its my wife and its my life haha
Because a mainline into my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then Im better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really dont care anymore
About all the JimJims in this town
And all the politicians makin crazy sounds
And everybody puttin everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
Cause when the smack begins to flow
And I really dont care anymore
Ah when that heroin is in my blood
Heh and that blood is in my head
Then thank God that Im good as dead
And thank your God that Im not aware
And thank God that I just dont care
And I guess I just dont know
Oh and I guess I just dont know
