Its hard being a man
Living in a garbage pail
My landlady called me up
She tried to hit me with a mop
I cant stand it anymore more
Cant stand it anymore more
Cant stand it anymore more
But if Shelly would just come back itd be alright
If Shelly would just come back itd be alright
I live with thirteen dead cats
A purple dog that wears spats
Theyre living out in the hall
And I cant stand it anymore
I cant stand it anymore more
I cant stand it anymore more
I cant stand it anymore more
But if Shelly would just come back itd be alright
If Shelly would just come back itd be alright
Its hard being a man
Living in a garbage pail
My lady called me up
And tried to hit me with a mop
I cant stand it anymore more
I cant stand it anymore more
I cant stand it anymore more
But if Shelly would just come back itd be alright
If Shelly would just come back itd be alright


Be alright
Be alright baby
Be alright
Oh God
