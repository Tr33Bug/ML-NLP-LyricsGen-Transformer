I Canâ€™t Stand It Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's hard being a man
Living in a garbage pail
My landlady called me up
She tried to hit me with a mop

[Chorus]
I can't stand it anymore, more
Can't stand it anymore, more
Can't stand it anymore, more
But if Shelly would just come back, it'd be alright
If Shelly would just come back, it'd be alright
[Verse 2]
I live with thirteen dead cats
A purple dog that wears spats
They're living out in the hall
And I can't stand it anymore

[Chorus]
I can't stand it anymore, more
I can't stand it anymore, more
I can't stand it anymore, more
But if Shelly would just come back, it'd be alright
If Shelly would just come back, it'd be alright

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
It's hard being a man
Living in a garbage pail
My lady called me up
And tried to hit me with a mop

[Chorus]
I can't stand it anymore, more
I can't stand it anymore, more
I can't stand it anymore, more
But if Shelly would just come back, it'd be alright
If Shelly would just come back, it'd be alright

Be alright
Be alright, baby
Be alright
Oh, God!1Embed
