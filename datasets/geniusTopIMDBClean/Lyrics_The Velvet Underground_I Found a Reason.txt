I Found a Reason Lyrics[Intro]
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa

[Verse 1]
I found a reason to keep living
Oh, and the reason, dear, is you
Oh, I found a reason to keep singing
Oh, and the reason, dear, is you
[Chorus 1]
Oh, I do believe
If you don't like things you leave
For some place you've never gone before

[Intro]
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa

[Verse 2]
Honey, I found a reason to keep living
And you know the reason, dear, it's you
And I've walked down life's lonely highways
Hand in hand with myself
And I realized
How many paths have crossed between us

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I do believe
You are what you perceive
What comes is better than what came before

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I do believe
You are what you perceive
What comes is better than what came before
You might also like[Outro]
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
And you'd better come, come, come, come to me
Come, come, come to me
Better come, come, come, come to me
Pa pa pa pa, pa2Embed
