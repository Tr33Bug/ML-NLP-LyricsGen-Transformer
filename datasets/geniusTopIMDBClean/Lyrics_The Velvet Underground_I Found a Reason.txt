I found a reason to keep living
Oh and the reason dear is you
Oh I found a reason to keep singing
Oh and the reason dear is you
Oh I do believe
If you dont like things you leave
For some place youve never gone before
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa

Honey I found a reason to keep living
And you know the reason dear its you
And Ive walked down lifes lonely highways
Hand in hand with myself
And I realized
How many paths have crossed between us
Oh I do believe
You are what you perceive
What comes is better than what came before
Oh I do believe
You are what you perceive
What comes is better than what came before


Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
And youd better come come come come to me
Come come come to me
Better come come come come to me
