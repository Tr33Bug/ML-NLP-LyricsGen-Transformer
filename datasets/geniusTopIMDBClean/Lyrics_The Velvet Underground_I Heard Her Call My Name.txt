I Heard Her Call My Name Lyrics[Verse]
Here she comes now, now
She's gone, gone, gone
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
Got my eyes wide open

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since I was on cripple Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees, aww baby, walkin'
I rapped for hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me, because...
[Chorus]
I know that she cares about me
I heard her call my name (Heard her call my name)
And I know that she's long dead and gone (Heard her call my name)
Still, it ain't the same (Heard her call my name)
Oh, when I wake up in this morning, mama (Heard her call my name)
I heard her call my name (Heard her call my name)
I know she's dead and long far gone (Heard her call my name)
I heard her call my name
And then, I felt my mind split open...

[Verse]
Here she comes now, now
She's gone, gone, gone
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
Got my eyes wide open

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since I was on cripple Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees
I rapped for hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me

[Chorus]
Oh, I know she cares about me
I heard her call my name, [?] (Heard her call my name)
I said that she's long dead and gone (Heard her call my name)
And still, she ain't the same (Heard her call my name)
But when I woke up in the morning, mama (Heard her call my name)
I heard her call my name, long gone (Heard her call my name)
I know she's dead and long far gone (Heard her call my name)
And still, I heard her call my name
And then, my mind split open...
