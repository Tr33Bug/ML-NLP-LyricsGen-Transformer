Here she comes now now
Shes gone gone gone
Ready ready ready ready ready
Got my eyes wide open
Ever since I was on cripple Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees aww baby walkin
I rapped for hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me because
I know that she cares about me
I heard her call my name  Heard her call my name 
And I know that shes long dead and gone  Heard her call my name 
Still it aint the same  Heard her call my name 
Oh when I wake up in this morning mama  Heard her call my name 
I heard her call my name  Heard her call my name 
I know shes dead and long far gone  Heard her call my name 
I heard her call my name
And then I felt my mind split open
Here she comes now now
Shes gone gone gone
Ready ready ready ready ready
Got my eyes wide open
Ever since I was on cripple Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees
I rapped for hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me
Oh I know she cares about me
I heard her call my name   Heard her call my name 
I said that shes long dead and gone  Heard her call my name 
And still she aint the same  Heard her call my name 
But when I woke up in the morning mama  Heard her call my name 
I heard her call my name long gone  Heard her call my name 
I know shes dead and long far gone  Heard her call my name 
And still I heard her call my name
And then my mind split open
