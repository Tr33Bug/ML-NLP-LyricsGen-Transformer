Ill be your mirror
Reflect what you are in case you dont know
Ill be the wind the rain and the sunset
The light on your door to show that youre home
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside youre twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
Cause I see you
I find it hard to believe you dont know
The beauty you are
But if you dont let me be your eyes
A hand to your darkness so you wont be afraid
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside youre twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
Cause I see you
Ill be your mirror  Reflect what you are 
Ill be your mirror  Reflect what you are 
Ill be your mirror  Reflect what you are 
Ill be your mirror  Reflect what you are
