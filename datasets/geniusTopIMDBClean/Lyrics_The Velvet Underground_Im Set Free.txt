Iâ€™m Set Free Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been set free and I've been bound
To the memories of yesterday's clouds
I've been set free and I've been bound
And now

[Chorus]
I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion
[Verse 2]
I've been blinded but now I can see
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walks right by me
And now

[Chorus]
I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I've been set free and I've been bound
Let me tell you people what I found
I saw my head laughing, rolling on the ground
And now

[Chorus]
I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusionYou might also like8Embed
