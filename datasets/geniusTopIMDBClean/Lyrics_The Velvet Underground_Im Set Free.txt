Ive been set free and Ive been bound
To the memories of yesterdays clouds
Ive been set free and Ive been bound
And now
Im set free
Im set free
Im set free to find a new illusion
Ive been blinded but now I can see
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walks right by me
And now
Im set free
Im set free
Im set free to find a new illusion
Ive been set free and Ive been bound
Let me tell you people what I found
I saw my head laughing rolling on the ground
And now
Im set free
Im set free
Im set free to find a new illusion
