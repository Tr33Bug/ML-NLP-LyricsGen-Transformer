Im sticking with you
Cause Im made out of glue
Anything that you might do
Im gonna do too
You held up a stagecoach in the rain
And Im doing the same
Saw you hanging from a tree
And I made believe it was me
Im sticking with you
Cause Im made out of glue
Anything that you might do
Im gonna do too
Moon people going to the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing we hang past right and wrong
Ill do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Ill do anything for you
Oh oh Im sticking with you
Oh oh Im sticking with you
Oh oh Im sticking with you
Oh oh Im sticking with you
Oh oh Im sticking with you
Oh oh Im sticking with you
Oh oh Im sticking with you
