Im waiting for my man
Twentysix dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington 125
Feel sick and dirty more dead than alive
Im waiting for my man
Hey white boy what you doin uptown
Hey white boy you chasin our women around
Oh pardon me sir its furthest from my mind
Im just lookin for a dear dear friend of mine
Im waiting for my man
Here he comes hes all dressed in black
PR shoes and a big straw hat
Hes never early hes always late
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
Im waiting for my man
Oh work it now
Up to a brownstone up three flights of stairs
Everybody bodies pinned you but nobody cares
Hes got the works gives you sweet taste
Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
Im waiting for my man
Baby dont you holler darlin dont you bawl and shout
Im feeling good you know Im gonna work it on out
Im feeling good Im feeling oh so fine
Until tomorrow but thats just some other time
Im waiting for my man
Walk it home
Oh its alright
Huh huh
