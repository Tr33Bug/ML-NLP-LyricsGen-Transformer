Louise take it all back to town
Aint it a shame youre too old to get around
But everybody knows you used to dance the hoochy coo
Just cant shake it like you used to do
Louise
Louise you used to work so hard
No one could compare
Always used to build a house
They came from everywhere
Men would scream the ladies faint
The childrens werent allowed
No one on another bill could ever draw a crowd
That was a long time ago
How you keep it up
I just dont know
Louise take it all back to town
Aint it a shame youre too old to get around
But everybody knows you used to dance the hoochy coo
Just cant shake it like you used to do
Louise
Louise
Younger girls keep coming up anxious for a chance
Theyve all been to college got degrees in modern dance
Things keep getting rougher now
Where they once was slick
Old routines are getting tired
Tassels just dont stick
That was a long time ago
How you keep it up
I just dont know


Louise take it all back to town
Aint it a shame youre too old to get around
But everybody knows you used to dance the hoochy coo
Just cant shake it like you used to do
Louise
Louise ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oh
Louise ooh
Its so very hard
Every day slips away
Away away
Oh oh oh oh oh
