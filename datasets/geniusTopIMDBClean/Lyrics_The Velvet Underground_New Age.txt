New Age Lyrics[Verse 1]
"Can I have your autograph?"
He said to the fat blonde actress
"You know I've seen every movie you've been in
From Paths of Pain to Jewels of Glory
And when you kissed Robert Mitchum
Gee, but I thought you'd never catch him"

[Pre-Chorus]
Over the hill right now
And you're looking for love
You're over the hill right now
And you're looking for love
[Chorus]
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me

[Verse 2]
"Can I have your autograph?"
He said to the fat blonde actress
"You know, I know everything you've done"
Anyway, I hate divorces
To the left is a marble shower
It was fun even for an hour but

[Pre-Chorus]
You're over the hill right now
And you're looking for love
You're over the hill right now
And you're looking for love

[Chorus]
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me

[Bridge]
Something's got a hold on me
And I don't know what
(Something's got a hold on me)
Oh, something's got a hold on me
And I don't know what
(Something's got a hold on me)

It's the beginning of a new age
It's the beginning of a new age
It's the beginning of a new age
It's a new age
It's the beginning of a new age
