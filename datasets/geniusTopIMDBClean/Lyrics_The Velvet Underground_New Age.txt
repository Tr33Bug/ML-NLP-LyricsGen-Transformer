Can I have your autograph
He said to the fat blonde actress
You know Ive seen every movie youve been in
From Paths of Pain to Jewels of Glory
And when you kissed Robert Mitchum
Gee but I thought youd never catch him
Over the hill right now
And youre looking for love
Youre over the hill right now
And youre looking for love
Ill come running to you honey when you want me
Ill come running to you honey when you want me
Can I have your autograph
He said to the fat blonde actress
You know I know everything youve done
Anyway I hate divorces
To the left is a marble shower
It was fun even for an hour but
Youre over the hill right now
And youre looking for love
Youre over the hill right now
And youre looking for love
Ill come running to you honey when you want me
Ill come running to you honey when you want me
Somethings got a hold on me
And I dont know what
Somethings got a hold on me 
Oh somethings got a hold on me
And I dont know what
Somethings got a hold on me 
Its the beginning of a new age
Its the beginning of a new age
Its the beginning of a new age
Its a new age
Its the beginning of a new age
Oh oh
