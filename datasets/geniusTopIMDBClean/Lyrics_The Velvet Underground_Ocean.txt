Ocean Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the sea
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Crashing in
Earth is a hollow hair, part of a bigger head
It nearly drives me crazy
In the Himalayas they have small rubber dolls
Recording all our actions

[Chorus]
And here come the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land
That has been down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea
[Verse 2]
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Down by the shore
Here comes the ocean and the waves
Crashing in
Insects are evil thoughts thought of by selfish men
It nearly drives me crazy
I am a lazy son, I never get things done
Made up mostly of water

[Chorus]
And here come the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the eye of the land
That has been down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea
Down by the sea

[Outro]
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the wavesYou might also likeEmbed
