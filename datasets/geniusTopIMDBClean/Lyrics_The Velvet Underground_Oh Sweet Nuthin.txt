Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He aint got nothing at all
Knocked the shirt right off his back
He aint got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger Brown
Walks with his head down to the ground
Took the shoes right off his feet
And threw the poor boy right out in the street
And this is what he said
Oh sweet nothin
She aint got nothin at all
Oh sweet nothin
She aint got nothin at all
Say a word for Polly May
She cant tell the night from the day
They threw her out in the street
Just like a cat she landed on her feet
And say a word for Joana Love
She aint got nothing at all
With every day she falls in love
And every night she falls
And when she does she says
Oh sweet nothin
You know she aint got nothin at all
Woahoh sweet nothin
She aint got nothin at all
Oh let me hear you
Oh say a word say a word for Jimmy Brown
He aint got nothing at all not a thing
Aint got nothin at all 
And not a shirt shirt on his back
Oh sweet nothin 
No he aint got nothing at all
Aint got nothin at all 
And say a word for Ginger
Oh sweet nothin 
He walks with his head to the ground
Aint got nothin at all 
He took the shoes took the shoes from his feet from his feet
Oh sweet nothin 
And threw the poor boy out into the street
Aint got nothin at all 
And then he said
Oh sweet sweet nothin
She aint got she aint got she aint got nothin at all
Sweet sweet sweet sweet nothin
Aint got nothin at all

Sweet sweet nuthin at all
