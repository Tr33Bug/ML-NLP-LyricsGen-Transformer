Over You  Lyrics
Here I go again
Just gonna play it like a fool again
Here I go again
Over you
Over you
Im just like a bell again
You know Im starting to ring again
Here I go again
Over you
Over you
Over you
Typically when I had it
Treated it like dirt
Now naturally when I dont have it
I am chasing less and less rainbows
Here we go again
I guess Im like a fool again
Here I go again
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
