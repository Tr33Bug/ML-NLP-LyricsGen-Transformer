Over You [1969 The Velvet Underground Live] Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I go again
Just gonna play it like a fool again
Here I go again
Over you
Over you

[Verse 2]
I'm just like a bell again
You know, I'm starting to ring again
Here I go again
Over you
Over you
Over you
[Bridge]
Typically, when I had it
Treated it like dirt
Now, naturally, when I don't have it
I am chasing less and less rainbows

[Verse 3]
Here we go again
I guess I'm like a fool again
Here I go again
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over youYou might also likeEmbed
