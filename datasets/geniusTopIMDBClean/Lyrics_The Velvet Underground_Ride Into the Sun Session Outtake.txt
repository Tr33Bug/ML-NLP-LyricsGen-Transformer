Ride Into the Sun  Session Outtake  Lyrics
Looking for another place
Somewhere else to be
Looking for another chance
To ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Where everything seems so pretty
When youre lonely and tired of the city
Remember its a flower made out of clay
To the city
Where everything seems so ugly
When your sitting at home in self pity
Remember youre just one more person
Whos living there
Its hard to live in the city
