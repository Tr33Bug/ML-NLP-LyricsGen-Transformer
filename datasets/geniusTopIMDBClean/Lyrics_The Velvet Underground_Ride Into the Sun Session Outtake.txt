Ride Into the Sun (Session Outtake) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Looking for another place
Somewhere else to be
Looking for another chance
To ride into the sun

[Chorus 1]
Ride into the sun[x4]

[Verse 2]
Where everything seems so pretty
When you're lonely and tired of the city
Remember it's a flower made out of clay
To the city
Where everything seems so ugly
When your sitting at home in self pity
Remember you're just one more person
Who's living there

[Chorus 2]
It's hard to live in the city[x3]You might also likeEmbed
