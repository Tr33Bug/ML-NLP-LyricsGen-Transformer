There was nothin happenin at all
Every time she puts on a radio
There was nothin goin down at all
Not at all
Then one fine mornin she puts on a New York station
You know she dont believe what she heard at all
She started shakin to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by rock n roll
Despite all the amputations
You know you could just go out
