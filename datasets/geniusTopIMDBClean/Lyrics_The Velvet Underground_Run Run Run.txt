Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave
I sold my soul must be saved
Gonna take a walk down to Union Square
You never know who youre gonna find there
You gotta run run run run run take a drag or two
Run run run run run Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do
Marguerita Passion I had to get her fixed
She wasnt well she was getting sick
Went to sell her soul she wasnt high
Didnt know thinks she could buy it
And she would run run run run run take a drag or two
Run run run run run Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do
Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
Hobnail boots wrapped around her toes
When she turned blue all the angels screamed
They didnt know they couldnt make the scene
She had to run run run run run take a drag or two
Run run run run run Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do


Beardless Harry what a waste
Couldnt even get a smalltown taste
Rode the trolleys down to 47th
Figured he was good to get himself to heaven
Because he had to run run run run run take a drag or two
Run run run run run Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do
