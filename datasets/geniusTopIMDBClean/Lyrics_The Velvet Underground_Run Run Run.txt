Run Run Run Lyrics[Verse 1]
Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave
"I sold my soul, must be saved
Gonna take a walk down to Union Square
You never know who you're gonna find there"

[Chorus]
You gotta run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do
[Verse 2]
Marguerita Passion, I had to get her fixed
She wasn't well, she was getting sick
Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high
Didn't know, thinks she could buy it

[Chorus]
And she would run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
Hobnail boots wrapped around her toes
When she turned blue, all the angels screamed
They didn't know, they couldn't make the scene

[Chorus]
She had to run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do

[Guitar Solo]

Beardless Harry, what a waste
Couldn't even get a small-town taste
Rode the trolleys down to 47th
Figured he was good to get himself to heaven

[Chorus]
Because he had to run, run, run, run, run, take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run, Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do7Embed
