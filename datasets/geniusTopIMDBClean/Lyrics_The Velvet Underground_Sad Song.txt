Sad Song LyricsLivin' on borrowed time
I'm in love w/ mary queen of scots
Fourteen hundred ninety three
And everythings like it should be
I'm gonna stop wasting my time
Henry the fifth would have broken my arm
Sad song sad song
Doo doo
Sad song sad song
Livin on borrowed time
I'm in love w/ mary queen of scots
1493
And things just like they ought to be
Primrose and kilts
Primrose and spain
Forget me not my queen of scots
Sad song sad song
Doo doo
