Sheâ€™s My Best Friend Lyrics[Verse 1]
She's my best friend
Certainly not the average girl
She's my best friend
Understands me when I'm fallin' down, down, down

[Bridge]
Oh, it hurts to be that way
Down, down, down
Oh, it hurts to know you're that kind of fella
[Verse 2]
Here's to Newspaper Joe
Dropped his teeth on the floor
Caught his hand in the door
Guess that's the way the news goes

[Chorus]
If you want to see me
Sorry but I'm not around
If you want to be me
Turn around, I'm by the window where the light is

[Verse 3]
She's my best friend
Better than a dog or car
She's my best friend
Understands me when I'm fallin' down, down, down

[Bridge]
Oh, it hurts to be that way
Down, down, down
Oh, it hurts to know you're that kinda fella

[Verse 4]
Here's to Mulberry Jane
She made jam when she came
Somebody cut off her feet
Now jelly rolls in the street
You might also like[Chorus]
If you want to see me
Sorry but I'm not around
If you want to be me
Turn around, I'm by the window where the light is

[Verse 1]
She's my best friend
Certainly not the average girl
She's my best friend
Understands me when I'm fallin'

[Outro]
Fallin' down
Fallin' down
Fallin' down
Fallin' down
Fallin' down2Embed
