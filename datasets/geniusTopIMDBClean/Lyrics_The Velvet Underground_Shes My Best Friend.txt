Shes my best friend
Certainly not the average girl
Shes my best friend
Understands me when Im fallin down down down
Oh it hurts to be that way
Down down down
Oh it hurts to know youre that kind of fella
Heres to Newspaper Joe
Dropped his teeth on the floor
Caught his hand in the door
Guess thats the way the news goes
If you want to see me
Sorry but Im not around
If you want to be me
Turn around Im by the window where the light is
Shes my best friend
Better than a dog or car
Shes my best friend
Understands me when Im fallin down down down
Oh it hurts to be that way
Down down down
Oh it hurts to know youre that kinda fella
Heres to Mulberry Jane
She made jam when she came
Somebody cut off her feet
Now jelly rolls in the street
If you want to see me
Sorry but Im not around
If you want to be me
Turn around Im by the window where the light is
Shes my best friend
Certainly not the average girl
Shes my best friend
Understands me when Im fallin
Fallin down
Fallin down
Fallin down
Fallin down
Fallin down
