Some kinds of love Marguerita told Tom
Between thought and expression lies a lifetime
Situations arise because of the weather
And no kinds of love are better than others
Some kinds of love Marguerita told Tom
Like a dirty French novel combines the absurd with the vulgar
And some kinds of love the possibilities are endless
And for me to miss one would seem to be groundless
I heard what you said Marguerita heard Tom
And of course youre a bore but in that youre not charmless
Cause a bore is a straight line that finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love ooh are mistaken for vision
Ooh alright
Put jelly on your shoulder let us do what you fear most
That from which you recoil but which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder baby lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression let us now kiss the culprit move it on
hm ahah
I dont know just what its all about 
But put on your red pajamas and find out
Hm hm hm hm
Ooh 
Hm hm ooh
