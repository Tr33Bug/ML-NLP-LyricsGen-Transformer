Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why shes given half her life to people she hates now
Stephanie says when answering the phone  Stephanie says 
What country shall I say is calling  me  from across the world
But shes not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her
Cause its all in her mind
Its all in her mind
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why it is though shes the door she cant be the room
Stephanie says but doesnt hang up the phone
What seashell sea is calling  me  from across her world
But shes not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her
Cause its all in her mind
Its all in her mind
Theyre asking is it good or bad
Its such an icy feeling
Its so cold in Alaska  Stephanie says 
Its so cold in Alaska  Stephanie says 
Its so cold in Alaska  Stephanie says
