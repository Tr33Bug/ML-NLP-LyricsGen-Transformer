Sunday morning brings the dawn in
Its just a restless feeling by my side
Early dawning Sunday morning
Its just the wasted years so close behind
Watch out the worlds behind you
Theres always someone around you who will call
Its nothing at all
Sunday morning and Im falling
Ive got a feeling I dont want to know
Early dawning Sunday morning
Its all the streets you crossed not so long ago
Watch out the worlds behind you
Theres always someone around you who will call
Its nothing at all
Watch out the worlds behind you
Theres always someone around you who will call
Its nothing at all
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
