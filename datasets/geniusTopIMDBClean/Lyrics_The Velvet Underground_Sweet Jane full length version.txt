Sweet Jane (full length version) LyricsStandin' on a corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest
And me I'm in a rock 'n' roll band. Huh
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim
Ya know, those were different times
All, all the poets studied rules of verse
And those ladies, they rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, whoa-uh!
Sweet Jane, oh-ho-uh!
Sweet Jane
I'll tell ya sump'n' now
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
And both of them save their monies
When they get home from work
Oooh! Sittin' down by the fire, ohhh!
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say, ah

(Get ready ya'll)
Sweet Jane
(C'mon baby doll)
Sweet Jane oh-oh-oh-oh-uh!
Sweet Jane

Some people, they like to go out dancin'
And other peoples, they have to work, just watch me now!
And there's even some evil mothers
Well, they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that, women never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes, woo!
And that, you know, children are the only ones who blush!
And that, life is, just to die
You might also likeAnd anyone who ever had a heart, oh!
They wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part, whoa!
They wouldn't turn around and hate it

Sweet Jane, whoa-oh-oh! Sweet Jane! Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane. Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

[This next part is only on the full length version of the song:]
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her, hey when she smiles

La lala lala la, la lala lala la
La lala lala la, la lala lala la
