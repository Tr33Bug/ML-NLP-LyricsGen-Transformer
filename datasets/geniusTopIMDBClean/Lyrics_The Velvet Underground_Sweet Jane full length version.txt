Sweet Jane  full length version  LyricsStandin on a corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset Jane is in her vest
And me Im in a rock n roll band Huh
Ridin in a Stutz Bearcat Jim
Ya know those were different times
All all the poets studied rules of verse
And those ladies they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane whoauh
Sweet Jane ohhouh
Sweet Jane
Ill tell ya sumpn now
Jack he is a banker
And Jane she is a clerk
And both of them save their monies
When they get home from work
Oooh Sittin down by the fire ohhh
The radio does play
The classical music there Jim
The March of the Wooden Soldiers
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say ah
Get ready yall 
Sweet Jane
Cmon baby doll 
Sweet Jane ohohohohuh
Sweet Jane
Some people they like to go out dancin
And other peoples they have to work just watch me now
And theres even some evil mothers
Well theyre gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that women never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes woo
And that you know children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die
And anyone who ever had a heart oh
They wouldnt turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part whoa
They wouldnt turn around and hate it
Sweet Jane whoaohoh Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her hey when she smiles
La lala lala la la lala lala la
La lala lala la la lala lala la
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
