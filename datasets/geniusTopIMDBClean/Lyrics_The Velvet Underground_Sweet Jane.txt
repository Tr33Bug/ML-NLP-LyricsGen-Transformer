Standin on the corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset Jane is in her vest
And me Im in a rock n roll band
Huh
Riding in a Stutz Bear Cat Jim
Ya know those were different times
Oh all the poets they studied rules of verse
And those ladies they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane woah
Sweet Jane oh oh
Sweet Jane
Let me tell ya somethin Jack he is a banker
And Jane she is a clerk
And both of them save their monies
Hah and when when they come home from work
Ooh sittin down by the fire oh
The radio does play the classical music there Jim
The March of the Wooden Soldiers
All you protest kids you can hear Jack say
Get ready
Sweet Jane come on baby
Sweet Jane oh
Sweet Jane
Some people they like to go out dancin
And other peoples they have to work just watch me now
And theres even some evil mothers
Well theyre gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that women never really faint
And that villains always blink their eyes ooh
And that ya know children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die
But anyone who ever had a heart
Oh they wouldnt turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
Oh they wouldnt turn around and hate it
Sweet Jane oh woah
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her hey when she smiles
La la la lalala
La la la lalala
La la la lalala
La la la lalala
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
