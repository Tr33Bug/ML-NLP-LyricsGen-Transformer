Somebody shut the door 
I know where temptation lies
Inside of you heart
You can talk during this 
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart
Well get out of here 
If youre gonna try to make it right
Youre surely gonna end up wrong
Wrong wrong wrong wrong
Oh shut the door 
Ahh 
Thats the only chord I know 
I know where the mirrors edge
Is inside of your heart
She didnt pay a dollar tonight 
I know where the razors edge
Is inside of your heart  Motown 
Its not even within five feet 
Well if youre gonna make it right
Youre surely gonna end up wrong
You dont look like Martha and the Vandellas 
Im just gonna start it all over again 
Somebody get her out of here 
Electricity comes from other planets 
Ooh 
Its not that bad a solo 
Four times   Oh 
Its pretty together 
You cant stay here Yes I can 
I can talk to myself as well 
Ill lock the door this time 
I know where temptation lies
Inside of your heart  Yes hes ready 
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart  Is he ready 
Well if youre gonna try to make it right
Youre surely gonna end up wrong
Oh the whole mess start again 
Well New York buildings are very high 
And not at all offensive lock the door 
Gonna carry on at infinite length my dear 
The Pope in the silver castle
