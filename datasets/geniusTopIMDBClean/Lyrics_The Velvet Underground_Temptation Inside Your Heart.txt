Temptation Inside Your Heart Lyrics[Verse 1: Lou Reed, John Cale]
(Somebody shut the door)
I know where temptation lies
Inside of you heart
(You can talk during this)
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart
(Well get out of here)
If you're gonna try to make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong
Wrong wrong wrong wrong
(Oh shut the door)
(Ahh)
(That's the only chord I know)
[Verse 2: Reed, Cale]
I know where the mirror's edge
Is inside of your heart
(She didn't pay a dollar tonight)
I know where the razors edge
Is inside of your heart (Motown)
(It's not even within five feet)
Well if you're gonna make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong
(You don't look like Martha and the Vandellas)
(I'm just gonna start it all over again)
(Somebody get her out of here)
(Electricity comes from other planets)
(Ooh)

[Guitar Solo with Commentary: Reed, Cale]
(It's not that bad a solo)
(Four times) (Oh!)
(It's pretty together)
(You can't stay here, Yes I can)
(I can talk to myself as well)
(I'll lock the door this time)

[Verse 3: Reed]
I know where temptation lies
Inside of your heart (Yes he's ready)
I know where the evil lies
Inside of your heart (Is he ready?)
Well if you're gonna try to make it right
You're surely gonna end up wrong

(Oh the whole mess start again)
(Well, New York buildings are very high)
(And not at all offensive, lock the door)
(Gonna carry on at infinite length, my dear)
(The Pope in the silver castle)Embed
