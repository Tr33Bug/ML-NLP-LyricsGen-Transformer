Myriad had choice of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose
And wanderings brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally mans patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly redrimmed and redlined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells
Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool good buy
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose choose again
Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame
Choose again
And Rovermans refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again choose to go
And if Epiphanys terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Dont scream try between
If you choose
If you choose try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game


I che che che che I
Che che che ka tah koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose choose to go
