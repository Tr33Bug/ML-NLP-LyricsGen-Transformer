The Black Angelâ€™s Death Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
Myriad had choice of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose?
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the Black Angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

[Verse 2]
And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red-rimmed and redlined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells
[Verse 3]
Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool, good buy
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

[Verse 4]
Sacrificials remain make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame
Choose again
And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
With the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

[Verse 5]
And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game
