Candy screen wrappers of silkscreen fantastic
Requiring memories
Both lovely and guilt free
Lurid and lovely with twilight of ages
Luscious and lovely and filthy with laughter
Laconic giggles
Ennui fort the passions
In order to justify most spurious desires
Rectify moments
Most serious and urgent
To hail upon the face of most odious time
Requiring replies most facile and vacuous
With words nearly singed
With the heartbeat of passions
Spew forth with the grace of a tart going under
Subject of great concern
Noble origin
Denigrate obtuse and active verbs pronouns
Skewer the sieve of optical sewer
Release the handle that holds all the gates up
Puncture the eyeballs that seep all the muck up
Read all the books and the people worth reading
And still see the muck on the sky of the ceiling
Please raise the flag
Rosy red carpet envy
English used here
Is messenger is nervous
Its no fun at all
Out here in the hall
Mister moonlight
Succulent smooth and gorgeous
Isnt it nice
Were number One and so forth
Isnt it sweet
Being unique
For screeching and yelling and various offenses
Lower the queen and bend her over the tub
Against the state the country the committee
Hold her head under the water please for an hour
For groveling and spewing and various offenses
Puncture the bloat with the wing of a sparrow
The inverse the obverse the converse the reverse
The sharpening wing of the edge of a sparrow
For suitable reckonings too numerous to mention
As the queen is fat she is devoured by rats
There is one way to skin a cat
Or poison a rat it is hetero
Four hear to three forthrightly stated
Relent
And obverse
And inverse
And perverse
And reverse
The inverse
Of perverse
And reverse
And reverse
And reverse
And reverse
And chop it
And pluck it
And cut it
And spit it
And sew it
To joy
On the edge
Of a cyclops
And spinet it
To rage
On the edge
Of a cylindrical minute
Put down that rag
Simpering callow and morose
Who let you in
If I knew then I could get out
The murder you see
Is a mystery to me
Dear Mister Muse
Fellow of wit and gentry
Medieval ruse
Filling the shallow and empty
Fools that duel
Duel in pools
To Rembrandt and Oswald
To peanuts and ketchup
Sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
Up to the stand with your foot on the bible
As king I must order and constantly arouse
If you swear to catch up and throw up and up up
A king full of virgin kiss me and spin it
Excuse to willow and wander dark wonders
Divest me of robessutures Harry and pig meat
The fate of a nation rests hard on your bosoms
The king on his throne puts his hand down his robe
The torture of inverse and silk screen and Harry
And set the tongue squealing the reverse and inverse
Tantalize poets with visions of grandeur
Their faces turn blue with the reek of the compost
As the living try hard to retain what the dead lost
With double dead sickness from writing at what cost
And business
And business
And reverse
And reverse
And set the brain reeling
The inverse
And perverse
Objections suffice
Apelike and tactile bassoon
Oboeing me
Cordon the virus section
Off to the left
Is what is not right
English arcane
Tantamount here to frenzy
Passing for me
Lascivious elder passion
Corpulent filth
Disguised as silk
Contempt contempt and contempt for the boredom
I shall poison the city and sink it with fire
For Cordless and Harry and Apepig and Scissor
The messengers wig seems fraught with desire
For blueberry picnics and pincenez and magpies
The messengers skirt would you please hook it higher
For children and adults all those under ninety
How truly disgusting Would you please put it down
A stray in this fray is no condom worth saving
As king Im quite just but its just quite impossible
A robe and a robe and a robe and a bat
No double class inverse could make lying worth dying
With cheap simian melodies
Hillbilly outgush
For illiterate ramblings
For cheap understanding
For mass understanding
The simple
The inverse
The compost
The reverse
The obtuse
And stupid
And business
And business
And cheap stupid lyrics
And simple mass reverse
While the real thing is dying
Exit the pig
Enter the Owl and Gorgeous
King on the left
It on the right and primping
Adjusting his nose
As he reads from his scroll
Folksy knockwurst
Peel back the skin of French and
What do you find
Follicles intertwinning
Succulent prose
Wrapped up in robes
Off with his head
Take his head from his neck off
Requiring memories both lovely and guiltfree
Put out his eyes then cut his nose off
Sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
Scoop out his brain
Put a string where his ears were
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Swing the whole mess at the end of the wire
Scratch out his eyes with the tip of a razor
Let the wire extend from the tip of a rose
Caroline Caroline Caroline Oh
But retains the remnants of what once was a nose
Pass me my robe
Fill my bath up with water
Jumpsuit and pig meat
And making his fortune
While making them happy
With the inverse and obverse
And making them happy
And making them happy
With the coy and the stupid
Just another dumb lackey
Who puts out one thing
While singing the other
But the real things alone
And it is no mans brother
No one knows
No nose is good news and senseless
Extend the wine
Drink here a toast to selfless
Ten year old port
Is perfect in court
Safety is nice
Not an unwise word spoken
Scary bad dreams
Made safe in lovely songs
No doom or gloom
Allowed in this room
Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
Cascade and Cyanide Rachaminoff Beethoven
Skull silly wagon and justice and perverse
And reverse the inverse and inverse and inverse
Blueberry catalog questionable earnings
Hustlers lament and the rest will in due cry
To battle and scramble and browbeat and hurt
While chewing on minstrels and choking on dirt
Disease please seems the order of the day
Please the king please the king please the king day
Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
Point of order return the king here to the ceiling
Oh not to be whistled
Or studied or hummed or
Remembered at nights
When the I is alone
But to skewer and ravage
And savage and split
With the grace of a diamond bellicose wit
To stun and to stagger with words as such stone
That those who do hear cannot again return home
Razzamatazz
Theres nothing on my shoulder
Lust is a must
Shaving my heads made me bolder
Will you kindly read
What it was I brought thee
Hello to Ray
Hello to Godiva and Angel
Who let you in
Isnt it nice
The party
Arent the lights
Pretty at night
Sick leaf and sorrow and pincers not scissors
Regard and refrain from the daughters of marriage
Regards for the elders and youngest in carriage
Regard and regard for the inverse and perverse
And obverse and diverse of reverse and reverse
Regard from the sick the dumb and the camel
From pumps storing water like brain is to marrow
Xray and filthy and cutting and then peeling
To skin and to skin and to bone and to structure
To livid and pallid and turgid and structured
And structured and structured and structured and structured
And regard and refrain and regard and refrain
The sick and the dumb inverse reverse and perverse
Contempt contempt and contempt for the seething
For writhing and reeling and twobit reportage
For sick with the body and sinister holy
The drown burst blue babies now dead on the seashore
The valorous horseman who hang from the ceiling
The pig on the carpet the dusty pale jissom
That has no effect for the sick with the seesaw
The inverse obverse converse reverse of inverse
The diverse and converse of reverse and perverse
And sweet pyrotechnics and lets have another
Of inverse converse diverse perverse and reverse
Hells graveyard is damned as they chew on their brains
The slick and the scum reverse inverse and perverse
Plowing while its done away
Dumb and ready pig meat
Sick upon the carpet
Climb into the casket
Safe within the parapet
Sack is in the parapet
Pigs are out and growling
Slaughter by the seashore
See the lifeguard drowning
Sea is full of fishes
Fishes full of china
China plates are falling
All fall down
Sick and shiny carpet
Lie before my eyeseyes
Lead me to the ceiling
Walk upon the wallwall
Tender as the green grass
Drink the whisky horror
See the young girls dancing
Flies upon the beaches
Beaches are for sailors
Nuns across the seawall
Black hood horseman raging
Swordsman eating fire
Fire on the carpet
Set the house ablazing
Seize and bring it flaming
Gently to the groundground
Dizzy Bell Miss Fortune
Fat and full of lovejuice
Drip it on the carpet
Down below the fire hose
Weep and whisky fortune
Sail me to the moon dear
Drunken dungeon sailors
Headless Roman horsemen
The king and queen are empty
Their heads are in the outhouse
Fish upon the water
Bowl upon the saviour
Toothless wigged Laureate
Plain and full of fancy
Name upon a letterhead
Impressing all the wheat germ
Love you for a nickel
Maul you for a quarter
Set the casket flaming
Do not go gentle blazing
Sick upon the staircase
Sick upon the pulpit
Blood upon the pillow
Climb into the parapet
See the church bells gleaming
Knife that scrapes a sick plate
Dentures full of air holes
The tailor couldnt mend straight
Shoot her full of air holes
Climbing up the casket
Take me to the casket
Teeth upon her red throat
Screw me in the daisies
Rip upon her holler
Snip the seas fantastic
Treat her like a sailor
Full and free and nervous
Out to make his fortune
Either this or that way
Sickly or in good health
Piss upon a building
Like a dog in training
Teach to heel or holler
Yodel on a sing song
Down upon the carpet
Tickle polyester
Sick within the parapet
Screwing for a dollar
Sucking on a firehose
Chewing on a rubber line
Tied to chairs and rarebits
Pay another player
Oh youre such a good lad
Heres another dollar
Tie him to the bedpost
Sick with witches covens
Craving for a raw meat
Bones upon the metal
Sick upon the circle
Down upon the carpet
Down below the parapet
Waiting for your bidding
Pig upon the carpet
Tumenescent railroad
Neuroanaesthesia analog
Ready for a good look
Drooling at the birches
Swinging from the birches
Succulent Nebraska
