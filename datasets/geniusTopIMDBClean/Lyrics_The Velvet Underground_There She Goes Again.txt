There she goes again  There she goes 
Shes out on the streets again  There she goes 
Shes down on her knees my friend  There she goes 
But you know shell never ask you please again  There she goes 
Now take a look theres no tears in her eyes
She wont take it from just any guy
What can you do  There she goes 
You see her walkin on down the street  There she goes 
Look at all your friends that shes gonna meet  There she goes 
You better hit her
There she goes again  There she goes 
Shes knocked out on her feet again  There she goes 
Shes down on her knees my friend  There she goes 
But you know shell never ask you please again  There she goes 
Now take a look theres no tears in her eyes
Like a bird you know she will fly
What can you do  There she goes 
You see her walkin on down the street  There she goes 
Look at all your friends that shes gonna meet  There she goes 
You better hit her
Now take a look theres no tears in her eyes
Like a bird you know she will fly fly fly away  Fly fly fly fly 
Oh see her walking on down the street  Fly fly fly fly 
Look at all your friends that shes gonna meet  Fly fly fly fly
