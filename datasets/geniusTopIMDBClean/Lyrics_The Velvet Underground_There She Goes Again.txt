There She Goes Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
There she goes again (There she goes)
She's out on the streets again (There she goes)
She's down on her knees, my friend (There she goes)
But you know she'll never ask you please again (There she goes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
She won't take it from just any guy

[Chorus]
What can you do? (There she goes)
You see her walkin' on down the street (There she goes)
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet (There she goes)
You better hit her
[Verse 2]
There she goes again (There she goes)
She's knocked out on her feet again (There she goes)
She's down on her knees, my friend (There she goes)
But you know she'll never ask you please again (There she goes)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
Like a bird, you know she will fly

[Chorus]
What can you do? (There she goes)
You see her walkin' on down the street (There she goes)
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet (There she goes)
You better hit her

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
Like a bird, you know she will fly, fly, fly away (Fly, fly, fly, fly)

[Outro]
Oh, see her walking on down the street (Fly, fly, fly, fly)
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet (Fly, fly, fly, fly)
She's gonna bawl and shout, she's gonna work it
She's gonna work it out, bye bye (Bye, bye, bye, bye)
Bye, bye, b-bye, bye, bye, b-b-b-b-bye, bye, bye, baby
(Bye, bye, bye, bye)
Oh, she's alright, she's alrightYou might also like4Embed
