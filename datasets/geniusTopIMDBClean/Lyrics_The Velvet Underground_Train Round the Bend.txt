Train round the bend
Taking me away from my country
Im sick of the trees take me to the city
Train going round the bend
Oh train coming round the bend
Been in the country oh much too long
Trying to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted ever seemed to grow
Train coming round the bend
Woah train coming round the bend
Hey I am just a city boy
Im really not the country kind
Oh I miss the city streets and the neon lights
You see the train coming round the bend oh what
The train coming round the bend
Once shes going twice
Shes going two and up and down
Shes going once shes going twice
Shes going the train coming round the bend
You know the train coming round the bend
Comin down out of nowhere
Taking me back where I belong
Ive been here once and I dont think its too nice
Oh the trains coming round the bend
Whoa the train coming round the bend
Alright
