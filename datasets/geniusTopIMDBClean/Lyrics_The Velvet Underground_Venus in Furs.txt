Venus in Furs Lyrics[Verse 1]
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

[Verse 2]
Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorned, imperious
Severin, Severin awaits you there
[Bridge]
I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

[Verse 3]
Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

[Verse 4]
Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip in love not given lightly
Taste the whip, now bleed for me

[Bridge]
I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

[Verse 5]
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Severin, your servant comes in bells, please don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heartYou might also like24Embed
