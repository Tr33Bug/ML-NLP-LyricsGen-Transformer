What Goes On Lyrics[Verse 1]
What goes on here in your mind?
I think that I am falling down
What goes on here in your mind?
I think that I am upside down

[Chorus]
Lady, be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady, be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright
[Verse 2]
I'm going up, and I'm going down
I'm going to fly from side to side
See the bells up in the sky
Somebody's cut the string in two

[Chorus]
Lady, be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady, be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
One minute born, one minute doomed
One minute up and one minute down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down

[Chorus]
Lady, be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady, be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alrightYou might also like5Embed
