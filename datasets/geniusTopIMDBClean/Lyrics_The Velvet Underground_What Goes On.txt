What goes on here in your mind
I think that I am falling down
What goes on here in your mind
I think that I am upside down
Lady be good do what you should
You know itll work alright
Lady be good do what you should
You know itll be alright
Im going up and Im going down
Im going to fly from side to side
See the bells up in the sky
Somebodys cut the string in two
Lady be good do what you should
You know itll work alright
Lady be good do what you should
You know itll be alright
One minute born one minute doomed
One minute up and one minute down
What goes on in your mind
I think that I am falling down
Lady be good do what you should
You know itll work alright
Lady be good do what you should
You know itll be alright
