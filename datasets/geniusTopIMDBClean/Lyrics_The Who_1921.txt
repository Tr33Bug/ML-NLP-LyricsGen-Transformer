Got a feeling 21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
So you think 21
Is going to be a good year
It could be good for me and her
But you and her no never
I had no reason to be overoptimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
What about the boy
What about the boy
What about the boy
He saw it all
You didnt hear it
I heard it 
You didnt see it
I saw it 
You wont say nothing to no one
I wont say nothing to no one 
Never in your life
Never in my life 
You never heard it
I heard it 
How absurd it all seems
Without any proof
How absurd it all seems without any proof 
You didnt hear it
I heard it 
You didnt see it
I saw it 
You never heard it not a word of it
I heard it every word of it 
You wont say nothing to no one
I wont say nothing to no one 
Never tell a soul
What you know is the truth
Never tell a soul
What I know is the truth 

Got a feeling 21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
Got a feeling 21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
I had no reason to be overoptimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
What about the boy
