Why should I care
Why should I care
Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing
Eau de Cologning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women
Magically bored on a quiet street corner
Free frustration in our minds and our toes
Quiet storm water mmmy generation
Uppers and downers either way blood flows
Inside outside  Leave me alone
Inside outside  Nowhere is home
Inside outside  Where have I been
Out of my brain on the 515
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train
On a raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
Back of a lorry
Holy hitching
Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in the war
Birthday punching
He man drag in a glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous in my high heel shoes
Tightly undone know what theyre showing
Sadly ecstatic that their heros are news


Inside outside  Leave me alone
Inside outside  Nowhere is home
Inside outside  Where have I been
Out of my brain on the 515
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train
Why should I care
Why should I care
