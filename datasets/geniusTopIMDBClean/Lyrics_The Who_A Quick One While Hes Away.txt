I cant believe it
Do my eyes deceive me
Am I back in your arms
Away from all harm
Its like a dream to be with you again
Cant believe that Im with you again
I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Drivers lap
And later with him had a nap

You are forgiven  you are forgiven 
You are forgiven  you are forgiven 
You are forgiven  you are forgiven 
Forgiven
