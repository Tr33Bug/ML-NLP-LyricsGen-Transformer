Deaf dumb and blind boy
Hes in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems
His musical dreams
Aint quite so bad
Ten years old
With thoughts as bold
As thoughts can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds cant usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
A vague haze of delirium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger
I suddenly see
Hes dressed in a silversparked
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground
Nothing to say and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds cant usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know


His eyes are the eyes
That transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together youll ride
