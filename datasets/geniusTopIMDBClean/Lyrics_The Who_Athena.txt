Athena I had no idea how much I would need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
Shes just a girl  shes a bomb
Athena all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think Ill  get along
Shes just a girl  shes a bomb
Just a girl just a girl
Shes just a girl
Athena my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath
Shes just a girl  shes a bomb
Consumed there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
Shes just a girl  shes a bomb
Im happy Im ecstatic
Just a girl just a girl
Shes just a girl
Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena you picked me up by my lapels and screamed leave her
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep I didnt mean that


Shes a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didnt mean it please
Shes a bomb
Athena I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I get along
Shes just a girl shes a bomb
