Out here in the fields I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I dont need to fight to prove Im right
I dont need to be forgiven yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Dont cry dont raise your eye
Its only teenage wasteland
Sally take my hand well travel south cross land
Put out the fire and dont look past my shoulder
The exodus is here the happy ones are near
Lets get together before we get much older
Teenage wasteland its only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland oh yeah
Teenage wasteland
Theyre all wasted
