Id gladly lose me to find you
Id gladly give up all I had
To find you Id suffer anything and be glad
Id pay any price just to get you
Id work all my life and I will
To win you Id stand naked stoned and stabbed
Id call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
Id gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you Im gonna run and never stop
Id pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you Im going to drown an unsung man
Id call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
I sit looking round
I look at my face in the mirror
I know Im worth nothing without you
And like one and one dont make two
One and one make one
And Im looking for that free ride to me
Im looking for you
Id gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you Im gonna run and never stop
Id pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you Im going to drown an unsung man
Id call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
