No one knows what its like
To be the bad man to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
No one knows what its like
To be hated to be fated
To telling only lies
But my dreams they arent as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours only lonely
My love is vengeance thats never free
No one knows what its like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger none of my pain and woe
Can show through
But my dreams they arent as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours only lonely
My love is vengeance thats never free
When my fist clenches crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool
And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver please give me a blanket
Keep me warm let me wear your coat
No one knows what its like
To be the bad man to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
