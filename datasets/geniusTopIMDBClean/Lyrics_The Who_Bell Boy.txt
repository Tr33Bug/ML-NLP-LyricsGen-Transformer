The beach is a place where a man can feel
Hes the only soul in the world thats real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Hazy days
Crazy days
Arent you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I dont suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in 63
Ive got a good job and Im newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel all gilt and flash
Remember the gaff where the doors were smashed
Bell Boy
I got to get running now
Bell Boy
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy
Carry this baggage out
Bell Boy
Always running at someones bleeding heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someones heel
Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
Then I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks
The beach is a place where a man can feel
Hes the only soul in the world thats real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Crazy days crazy days
Crazy days crazy days
Arent you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I dont suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in 63
People often change
But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot
From a life like mine
The secret to me
It aint flown like a flag
I carry it behind this bleeding little badge
What says
Bell Boy
I got to get running now
Bell Boy
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy
Carry the bloody baggage out
Bell Boy
Always running at someones heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someones heel
