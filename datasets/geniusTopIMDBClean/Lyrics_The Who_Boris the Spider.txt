Look hes crawling up my wall
Black and hairy very small
Now hes up above my head
Hanging by a little thread
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Now hes dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe hes as scared as me
Wheres he gone now I cant see
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Creepy crawly creepy crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
There he is wrapped in a ball
Doesnt seem to move at all
Perhaps hes dead Ill just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Creepy crawly creepy crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
Creepy creepy crawly crawly
Hes come to a sticky end  Crawly 
Dont think he will ever mend  Creepy crawly 
Never more will he crawl round  Creepy crawly 
Hes embedded in the ground  Creepy crawly 
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
