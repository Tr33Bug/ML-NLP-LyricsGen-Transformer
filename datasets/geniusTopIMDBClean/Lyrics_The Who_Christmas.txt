Did you ever see the faces of the children They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning hours before the winter suns ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean including heavens generosity
Peeping round the door to see what parcels are for free in curiosity
And Tommy doesnt know what day it is
He doesnt know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave
Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently and unaware of anything
Playing poxy pinball picks his nose and smiles and pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love but how can men whove never seen light be enlightened
Only if hes cured will his spirits future level ever heighten
And Tommy doesnt know what day it is
He doesnt know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Can you hear me
How can he be saved
See me feel me touch me heal me
See me feel me touch me heal me
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Tommy can you hear me
Can you hear me
How can he be saved
