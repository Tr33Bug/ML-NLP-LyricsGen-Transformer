Were on our own cousin
All alone cousin
Lets think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You wont be much fun
Being blind deaf and dumb
But Ive no one to play with today
Do you know how to play hideandseek
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you wont go anywhere
Theres a lot I can do with a freak
How would you feel if I turned on the bath
Ducked your head under and started to laugh
What would you do if I shut you outside
To stand in the rain and catch cold so you die
Im the school bully
The classroom cheat
The nastiest playfriend
You ever could meet
Ill stick pins in your fingers
And tread on your feet
Were on our own cousin
All alone cousin
Lets think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You wont be much fun
Being blind deaf and dumb
But Ive no one to play with today
Do you know how to play hideandseek
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you wont go anywhere
Theres a lot I can do to the freak


Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Would change your expression to one of alarm
Drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push at the top of the stairs
Im the school bully
The classroom cheat
The nastiest playfriend
You ever could meet
Ill put glass in your dinner
And spikes in your seat
