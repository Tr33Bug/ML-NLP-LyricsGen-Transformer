Why should I care
If I have to cut my hair
I got to move with the fashion
Or be outcast
I know I should fight
But my old man hes really alright
And Im still living at home
Even though it wont last
Zoot suit white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
Im out on the street again
And Im leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just cant explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool
And though I dont want to hurt them
Mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues
And there doesnt seem much hope
Theyll
Let me stay
Zoot suit white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
Im out on the street again
And Im leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just cant explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
Why do I have to be different to them
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend
Have the same old row again and again
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice Im around
I work myself to death just to fit in
Im coming down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work
He wasnt talking
Its all a game
And inside Im just the same
My fried egg makes me sick
First thing in the morning
