Laugh and say Im green
Ive seen things youve never seen
Talk behind my back
Im off the beaten track
Ill take on anyone
Aint scared of a bloody nose
Drink till I drop down
With one eye on my clothes
What is it
Ill take it
Who is she
Ill rape it
Got a bet there
Ill meet it
Getting high
You cant beat it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When Im pilled you dont notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
You say shes a virgin
But Im gonna be the first in
Her fellas going to kill me
Oh fucking will he
Im seeing ddouble
Dont miss me if you can
Theres gonna be trouble
When she chooses her man
What is it
Ill take it
Who is she
Ill rape it
Got a bet there
Ill meet it
Getting high
You cant beat it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When Im pilled you dont notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin


Is it me for a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Im going back soon
Home to get that baboon
Who cut up my eye
Tore up my Levis
Im feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down
What is it
Ill take it
Who is she
Ill rape it
Got a bet there
Ill meet it
Getting high
You cant beat it
What is it
Ill take it
Who is she
Ooh Ill rape it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When Im pilled you dont notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
Is it me for a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
