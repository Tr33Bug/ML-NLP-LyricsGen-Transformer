The sun shines
And people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides
And people forget
Forget theyre hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks
And people forget
Forget theyre hiding
Behind an eminence front
Eminence front its a put on
Its an eminence front
Its an eminence front its a put on
An eminence front
Eminence front its a put on eminence front
Its an eminence front
Its an eminence front its a put on
Its a put on its a put on its a put on
Come on join the party dress to kill
Wont you come and join the party dress to kill
Dress to kill
The drinks flow
People forget
That big wheel spins the hair thins
People forget
Forget theyre hiding
The news slows
People forget
The shares crash hopes are dashed
People forget
Forget theyre hiding


Behind an eminence front
Eminence front its a put on
Its just an eminence front
An eminence front its a put on
An eminence front
An eminence front its a put on
Eminence front
Its an eminence front its a put on
Its a put on its a put on its a put on
Come and join the party dress to
Come and join the party dress to
Come on join the party dress to
Come on join the party dress to kill
Dress yourself to kill
