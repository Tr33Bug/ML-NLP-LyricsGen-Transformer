Eyesight to the Blind  The Hawker  LyricsYou talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Yeah you talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin
She brings eyesight to the blind
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she starts to shakin
The dumb begin to talk
Instrumental Bridge
Shes got the power to heal you
Never fear
Shes got the power to heal you
Never fear
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hear
