Im your wicked Uncle Ernie
Im glad you wont see or hear me
As I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Your mother left me here to mind you
Now Im doing what I want to
Fiddling about
Fiddling about
Fiddle about
Down with the bedclothes
Up with your nightshirt
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
You wont shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about

Fiddle about
Fiddle about

Fiddle fiddle fiddle
