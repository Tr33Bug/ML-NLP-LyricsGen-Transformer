Happy Jack wasnt old but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man
The kids would all sing he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey
The kids couldnt hurt Jack
They tried tried tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied lied lied lied lied
But they couldnt stop Jack or the waters lapping
And they couldnt prevent Jack from feeling happy
But they couldnt stop Jack or the waters lapping
And they couldnt prevent Jack from feeling happy
The kids couldnt hurt Jack
They tried tried tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied lied lied lied lied
But they couldnt stop Jack or the waters lapping
And they couldnt prevent Jack from being happy
I saw yer
