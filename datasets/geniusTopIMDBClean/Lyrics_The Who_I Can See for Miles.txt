I know youve deceived me
Now heres a surprise
I know that you have
Cause theres magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
If you think that I dont know about
The little tricks youve played
And never see you when deliberately
You put things in my way
Well heres a poke at you
Youre gonna choke on it too
Youre gonna lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
You took advantage of my trust in you
When I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys
And now youve got the nerve to say
That you still want me
Well thats as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while


I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
I know youve deceived me
Now heres a surprise
I know that you have
Cause theres magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal
Are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball
To see right through the haze
Well heres a poke at you
Youre gonna choke on it too
Youre gonna lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and
Miles and miles and miles and
Miles and miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
