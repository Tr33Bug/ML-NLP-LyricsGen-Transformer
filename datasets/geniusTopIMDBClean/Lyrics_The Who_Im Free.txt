Im free Im free
And freedom tastes of reality
Im free Im free
And Im waiting for you to follow me
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
Youd laugh and say nothings that simple
But youve been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple
Im free Im free
And freedom tastes of reality
Im free Im free
And Im waiting for you to follow me
How can we follow
How can we follow
