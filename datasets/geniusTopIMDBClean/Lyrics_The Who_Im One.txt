Every year is the same
And I feel it again
Im a loser
No chance to win
Leaves start falling
Come down is calling
Loneliness starts sinking in
But Im One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
Youll all see Im the One
Where do you get
Those blue blue jeans
Faded patched secret so tight
Where do you get
That walk oh so lean
Your shoes and your shirts
All just right
But Im One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
Youll all see Im the One
I got a Gibson
Without a case
But I cant get that even tanned look on my face
Ill fitting clothes
And I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud
But Im One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
Youll all see Im the One


Im the One
