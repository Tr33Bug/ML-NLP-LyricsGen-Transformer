You were under the impression
That when you were walking forwards
That youd end up further onward
But things aint quite that simple
You got altered information
You were told to not take chances
You missed out on new dances
Now youre losing all your dimples
My jackets going to be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet
Love rain on me
Rain on me
Love rain on me
Love
Ive had enough of living
Ive had enough of dying
Ive had enough of smiling
Ive had enough of crying
Ive taken all the high roads
Ive squandered and Ive saved
Ive had enough of childhood
Ive had enough of graves
Get a job and fight to keep it
Strike out to reach a mountain
Be so nice on the outside
But inside keep ambition
Dont cry because you hunt them
Hurt them first theyll love you
Theres a millionaire above you
And youre under his suspicion


My jackets going to be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
Wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet
Love rain on me
Rain on me
Love rain on me
Love
Had enough of dancehalls
Ive had enough of pills
Ive had enough of streetfights
Ive seen my share of kills
Im finished with the fashions
And acting like Im tough
Im bored with hate and passion
Ive had enough of trying to love
