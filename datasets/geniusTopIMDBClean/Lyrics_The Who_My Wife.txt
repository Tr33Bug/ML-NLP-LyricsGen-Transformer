My lifes in jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what Im gonna be
I aint been home since Friday night
And now my wife is coming after me
Give me police protection
Im gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard a black belt Judo expert
With a machine gun
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me wont be no time to explain
She thinks Ive been with another woman
And thats enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car put on my lead boots
And take a long long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But Ill still be alive
All I did was have a bit too much to drink
And I picked the wrong precinct
Got picked up by the law
And now I aint got time to think
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me wont be no time to explain
She thinks Ive been with another woman
And thats enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car put on my lead boots
And take a long long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But Ill still be alive
And Im ohso tired of running
Gonna lay down on the floor
Ive gotta rest some time
So I can get to run some more yeah
Shes comin

Shes comin
Shes comin
Shes comin
Shes comin
Shes comin
Shes comin
