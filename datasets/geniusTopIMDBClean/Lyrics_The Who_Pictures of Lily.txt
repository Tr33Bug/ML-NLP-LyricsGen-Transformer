I used to wake up in the morning
I used to feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad
He said Son now heres some little somethings
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights aint quite so lonely
In fact I I dont feel bad at all
I dont feel bad at all
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright
Pictures of Lily
Lily oh Lily
Lily oh Lily
Pictures of Lily
And then one day things werent quite so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said Son now dont be silly
Shes been dead since 1929
Oh how I cried that night
If only Id been born in Lilys time
It would have been alright
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
For me and Lily are together in my dreams
And I ask you Hey mister have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily
