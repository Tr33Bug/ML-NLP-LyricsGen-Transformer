Ever since I was a young boy Ive played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton I mustve played em all
But I aint seen nothin like him in any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
He stands like a statue becomes part of the machine
Feelin all the bumpers always playin clean
Plays by intuition the digit counters fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
Hes a pinball wizard there has to be a twist
A pinball wizards got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it I dont know
What makes him so good
Aint got no distractions cant hear no buzzes and bells
Dont see no lights aflashin plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
Even on my favorite table he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in and he just does the rest
Hes got crazy flipper fingers never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
