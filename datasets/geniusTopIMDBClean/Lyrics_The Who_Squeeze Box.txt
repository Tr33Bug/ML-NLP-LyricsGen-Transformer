Mamas got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest
Cause shes playing all night
And the musics alright
Mamas got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
Well the kids dont eat
And the dog cant sleep
Theres no escape from the music
In the whole damn street
Cause shes playing all night
And the musics alright
Mamas got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
Shes playin all night and the musics all right
Mamas got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes squeeze me come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
Im so in love with you
Mamas got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
Cause shes playing all night
And the musics alright
Mamas got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
