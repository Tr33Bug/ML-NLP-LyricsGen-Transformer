You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
But Im a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young but Im just backdated yeah
Substitute  Your lies for fact
Substitute  I see right through your plastic mac
Substitute  I look all White but my dad was Black
Substitute  My finelooking suit is really made out of sack
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east
And the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
Its a genuine problem you wont try
To work it out at all just pass it by pass it by
Substitute  Me for him
Substitute  My coke for gin
Substitute  You for my mum
Substitute  At least Ill get my washing done
