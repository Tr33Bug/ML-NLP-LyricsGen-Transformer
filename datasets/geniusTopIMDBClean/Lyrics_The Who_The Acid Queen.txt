If your child aint all he should be now
This girl could put him right
Ill show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
Im the gypsy the acid queen
Pay before we start
Im the Gypsy I guarantee
To tear your soul apart
Give us a room close the door
Leave us for a while
Your boy wont be a boy no more
Young but not a child
Im the gypsy the acid queen
Pay before we start
The gypsy Im guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the gypsy queen must do
Youre gonna hit the road
My work is done
Now look at him
Hes never been more alive
His head it shakes
His fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe
Im the gypsy the acid queen
Pay before we start
Im the gypsy Im guaranteed
To break your little heart
If your child aint all he should be now
This girl will put him right
Ill show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
Im the gypsy the acid queen
Pay before we start
The gypsy Im guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
