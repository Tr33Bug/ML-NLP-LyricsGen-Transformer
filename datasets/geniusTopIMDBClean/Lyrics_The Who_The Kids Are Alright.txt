I dont mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
Thats fine
I know them all pretty well
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids theyre alright
The kids are alright
Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away
And I know if I dont Ill go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids theyre alright
The kids are alright
I know if I go things would be a lot better for her
I had things planned but her folks wouldnt let her
I dont mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
Thats fine
I know them all pretty well
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids theyre alright
The kids are alright


Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away
And I know if I dont Ill go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids theyre alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
