You declared you would be three inches taller
You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you
Im the guy in the sky
Flying high flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
Im the punk in the gutter
Im the new president
And I grew and I bent
Dont you know
Dont it show
Im the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGGgggg generation
We tried to speak between lines of oration
You could only repeat what we told you
Your axe belongs to a dying nation
They dont know that we own you
Youre watching movies trying to find the feelers
You only see what we show you
Were the slaves of the phony leaders
Breathe the air we have blown you
Im the guy in the sky
Flying high flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
Im the punk in the gutter
Im the new president
And I grew and I bent
Dont you know
Dont it show
Im the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGGgggg generation
I have to be careful not to preach
I cant pretend that I can teach
And yet I lived your future out
By pounding stages like a clown
And on the dance floor broken glass
And bloody faces slowly pass
The numbered seats in empty rows
It all belongs to me you know


You declared you would be three inches taller
You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you
Im the guy in the sky
Flying high flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
Im the punk in the gutter
Im the new president
And I grew and I bent
Dont you know
Dont it show
Im the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGGgggg generation
