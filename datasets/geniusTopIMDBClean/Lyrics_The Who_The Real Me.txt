I went back to the doctor
To get another shrink
I sit and tell him about my weekend
But he never betrays what he thinks
Can you see the real me doctor doctor
Can you see the real me doctor
Oh doctor
I went back to my mother
I said Im crazy Ma help me
She said I know how it feels son
Cause it runs in the family
Can you see the real me mother mother
Can you see the real me mother
Oh mama
Can you see
Can you see the real me
Can you see
Can you see the real me
The real me the real me
The cracks between the paving stones
Like rivers of flowing veins
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by
She doesnt want to know me now
Can you see the real me can you can you
Can you see the real me can you
Oh yes
I ended up with the preacher
Full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate
Can you see the real me preacher preacher
Can you see the real me preacher
Can you see can you see can you see oh
Can you see the real me doctor
Can you see the real me mother
Can you see the real me me me me me
