Welcome to the camp
I guess you all know why were here
My name is Tommy
And I became aware this year
If you want to follow me
Youve got to play pinball
And put in your ear plugs put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
Hey you getting drunk
So sorry Ive got you sussed
Hey you smoking mother nature
This is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr Normal
Dont try to gain my trust
Cause you aint gonna follow me any of those ways
Although you think you must
Were not gonna take it
Were not gonna take it
Were not gonna take it
Were not gonna take it
Were not gonna take it
Never did and never will
Were not gonna take it
Gonna break it
Gonna shake it
Lets forget it better still
Now you cant hear me
Your ears are truly sealed
You cant speak either
Your mouth is filled
You cant see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie to guide you to
Your very own machine
Were not gonna take it
Were not gonna take it
Were not gonna take it
Were not gonna take it


Were not gonna take it
Never did and never will
Dont want no religion
And as far as we can tell
We aint gonna take you
Never did and never will
Were not gonna take you
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Lets forget you better still
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Lets forget you better still
See Me Feel Me
See me feel me
Touch me heal me
See me feel me
Touch me heal me
See me feel me
Touch me heal me
See me feel me
Touch me heal me
Listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story
