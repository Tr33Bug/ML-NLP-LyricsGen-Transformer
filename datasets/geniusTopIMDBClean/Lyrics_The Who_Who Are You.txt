Who are you
Who who who who
Who are you
Who who who who
Who are you
Who who who who
Who are you
Who who who who
I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair
Well who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
I really want to know  Who are you Who who who who 
Tell me who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Because I really want to know  Who are you Who who who who 
I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God theres got to be another way
Well who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Oh who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Come on tell me who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Oh who the fuck are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Who are you
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh


Who are you
Who who who who
Who are you
Who who who who
Who are you
Who who who who
Who  are you
Who who who who
I really want to know  Who are you Who who who who 
I really want to know  Who are you Who who who who 
Come on tell me who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Because I really want to know  Who are you Who who who who 
I know theres a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this
Well who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Tell me whoa are you Who are you Who who who who 
Oh I really want to know  Who are you Who who who who 
Tell me tell me who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Come on come on who  Who are you Who who who who 
Oh who the fuck are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Who are you  Who are you Who who who who 
Oh tell me who are you  Who are you Who who who who

Come on tell me who are you you you you
