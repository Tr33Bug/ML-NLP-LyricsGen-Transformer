Well be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
Ill tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then Ill get on my knees and pray
We dont get fooled again
Change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold thats all
And the world looks just the same
And history aint changed
Cause the banners they all flown in the last war
Ill tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then Ill get on my knees and pray
We dont get fooled again
No no
Ill move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left halfalive
Ill get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do you


Yeah
Theres nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are effaced bythebye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight
Ill tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then Ill get on my knees and pray
We dont get fooled again
Dont get fooled again
No no
Yeah
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
