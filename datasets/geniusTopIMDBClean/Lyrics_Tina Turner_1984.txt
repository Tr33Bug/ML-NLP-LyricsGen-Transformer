1984
Someday they wont let you
Now you must agree
The times they are a telling
And the changing isnt free
You read it in the tea leaves
And the tracks are on TV
Beware the Savage Jaw
In 1984
Theyll split your bleeding cranium
And fill it full of air
Theyll tell you that youre eighty
And really you wont care
Youll be shooting up on everything
Tomorrows never there
Beware the Savage Jaw
In 1984
Come see come see
Remember me
I played in an all night movie role
Yeah you thought it would last
But I guess weve enrolled
In 1984
Who could ask for more
1984
Who could ask for more
Im looking for a vehicle
Im looking for a ride
Im looking for a party
Im looking for a sign
Im looking for the treason
That I knew in Sixty Five
Beware the Savage Jaw
In 1984
Come see come see
Remember me
I played in an all night movie role
You said it would last
But I guess weve enrolled
In 1984
Who could ask for more
1984
Who could ask for more
1984
