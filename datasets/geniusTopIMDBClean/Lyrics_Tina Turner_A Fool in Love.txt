Oh theres something on my mind
Wont somebody please please tell me whats wrong
Youre just a fool you know youre in love
Youve got to face it to let it explode
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes youre happy and sometimes youre sad
One more time 
You know you love him you cant understand  Tell me bout it 
Why he treats you like he do when hes such a good man
And listen hes got me smiling when I should be ashamed
Got me laughin when my heart is in pain
Oh no I must be a fool
Cause Ill do anything he wants me to now how come
Youre just a fool you know youre in love  Tell me one more time 
Youve got to face it to let it explode  Hey 
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes youre happy and sometimes youre sad  One more time 
You know you love him you cant understand
Why he treats you like he do when hes such a good man
And listen without the man I dont wanna live
You think Im lyin but Im telling you like it is
Hes got my nose open and thats no lie
And I Im gonna keep him satisfied
Youre just a fool you know youre in love  Tell me one more time 
Youve got to face it to let it explode  Oh how come 
You take the good along with the bad  Tell me how come 
Sometimes youre happy and sometimes youre sad  One more time 
You know you love him you cant understand  Tell me bout it 
Why he treats you like he do when hes such a good man
And listen ways of action speaks louder than words
The truest sound that I ever heard
I trust the man and all that he do
And I and Ill do anything he wants me to now how come
Cause just a fool you know youre in love  Tell me one more time 
Youve got to face it to let it explode  Hey 
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes youre happy and sometimes youre sad  Tell me one more time 
You know you love him you cant understand  Tell me bout it 
Why he treats you like he do when hes such a good man
