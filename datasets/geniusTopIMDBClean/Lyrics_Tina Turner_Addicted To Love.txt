The lights are on but youre not home
Your mind is not your own
Your body sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You cant eat you cant sleep
Theres no doubt youre in deep
Your throat is tight you cant breathe
Another kiss is all you need
Oh you like to think that youre immune to the stuff oh yeah
Its closer to the truth
You know youre gonna have to face it
Youre addicted to love
You might as well face it youre addicted to love
You see the signs but you cant read
Youre running at a different speed
Your heart beats at double time
Another kiss and youll be mind one track mind
You cant be saved another young love is all you crave
And if the sun left you you dont mind it feels blue
Oh you like to think that youre immune to the stuff oh yeah
Its closer to the truth
You know youre gonna have to face it
Youre addicted to love
Gonna have to face it youre addicted to love
Might as well face it youre addicted to love
Might as well face it youre addicted to love
Might as well face it youre addicted to love
Might as well face it youre addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it youre addicted to love
Your lights are on but youre not home
Your mind is not your own
Your body sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You cant eat you cant sleep
Theres no doubt youre in deep
Your throat is tight you cant breathe
Another kiss is all you need


Oh you like to think that youre immune
To the stuff oh yeah
Its closer to the truth
You know youre gonna have to face it
You might as well face it
Youre addicted to love
You might as well face it youre addicted to love
