Oh waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel
When things are going wrong
Why dont you ask me how I feel
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feel
Youre much too loose to hold
Why dont you ask me how I feel
I close my eyes
To follow you
To my surprise
Youre so untrue
And Im crying
Im dying
Oh Im waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel
And when you keep me hanging on
Why dont you ask me how I feel
The waters run so deep
Ask me how I feel
When I dont get any sleep
Why dont you ask me how I feel
And when youre down
You lean on me
Youre a fool
Too blind to see
Oh Im waiting in the storm
Why dont you ask me how I feel
Oh what the hell is going on
Why dont you ask me how I feel
When you stay out late at night
Oh ask me how I feel
When you think that Im uptight
Why dont you ask me how I feel
You dont treat me tender
No matter what I do
But Im the great pretender
Woah ho ho ho
Oh Im waiting in the storm
Ask me how I feel
When things are going wrong
Come on an ask me how I feel
The night is awful cold
Ask me how I feel
