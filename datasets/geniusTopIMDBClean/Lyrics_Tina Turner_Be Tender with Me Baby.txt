You got the right to tell me
Its all over
It isnt like me to be
Begging you
Dont let go dont let go
Just stay with me another day
When im not myself
Please understand me
Im so confused i dont know what to do
But dont give up
Dont give up
It just may take a little time
Be tender with me baby
Im so afraid youll go away
Be tender with me baby always
I know that youve been patient
With my weakness
And that you hate to see me cry
But i know yes i know
It doesnt have to be this way
But im so lonely i could die
Be tender with me baby
Im so afraid youll go away
Be tender with me baby always
Why does my heart keep on longing
Why do i feel like i do
I hope you see this is not really me
This is just a phase that im going through
Be tender with me baby
Be tender with me baby
Im so afraid youll go away
Be tender with me baby
For always always
Be tender with me baby
Im so afraid youll go away
Be tender with me baby
Always for always always
