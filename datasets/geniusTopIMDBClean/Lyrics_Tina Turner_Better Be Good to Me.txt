A prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
Im captured by your spell  captured 
Oh yes Im touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion
Should I
Should I
Oh you better be good to me
Thats how its got to be now
Cause I dont have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
Yeah you better be good good
Cmon cmon be good to me
I think its all so right
That we dont need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case
Yes I know you keep telling me that you love me
And I really do want to believe
But did you think Id just accept you in blind faith
Oh sure babe anything to please you
But you better be good to me
Thats how its got to be now
Cause I dont have the time for your overloaded lines
And you better be good to me
Yeah you better be good
Be good to me
And I really dont see why its so hard to be
Good to me and you know
I dont understand whats your plan
That you cant be good to me
What I cant feel I surely cannot see
Why cant you be good to me
And if its not real I do not wish to see
Why dont you be good to me
Why cant you be good to me
Why cant you be good to me
Why cant you be good to me
Why cant you be good to me
Why cant you be good to me
Be good good to me
Be good to me
Cause I dont have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And I dont have the time for your overloaded lies
So you better be good to me
Yeah you better be good
Better be good to me
Better be good
Cause I dont have the time for your overloaded lies
And I dont have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
Why cant you be  be good to me
Why cant you be  be good
Why cant you be  be good to me
Why cant you be 
Cause I dont have no use for what you loosely call the truth
And I dont have the time for your overloaded lies
You better be good to me
Why cant you be  good to me
Why cant you be  good to me
Be good
Be good to me
Why cant you be  Why cant you be  good to me  Be good to me 
Why cant you be  Why cant you be  good to me  Be good to me 
Cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon cmon
Be good to me
