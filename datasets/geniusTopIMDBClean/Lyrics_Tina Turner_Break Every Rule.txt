Every road that I walk
Every single flight I ever take
Though Im thousands of miles away
In my mind every journey leads me closer to you
Ive been all around this world
Ive been in far too many states
But Im under your spell
Ive made my mistakes oh you can probably tell
Youre every dream that I dream
Youre every beautiful thing Ive ever seen
Im always singing your praises
Counting the days away
I would be your slave
Id even be your fool
Im so in love with you
Im in love with you baby
Im going to break every rule
I hope you can forgive
Every white lie Im forced to tell
They say that every things fair in love and in war
And Im not above cheating for you
One night Ill catch you off your guard
And youll finally fall so hard
Strategically speaking Im already beaten
Ill surrender to you
