Darlin  You Know I Love You LyricsI know you love me baby
But you never tell me so
I know you love me baby
But you never tell me so
If you dont tell me that you love me
Im gonna pack my bags and go
I live across the street from the jukebox baby
And all night long they play the blues
I live across the street from the jukebox baby
And all night long they play the blues
And everytime they spin their records
Honey it makes me think of you
Theres one little song in particular baby
That always sticks in my mind
Theres one little song in particular baby
That always sticks in my mind
Every time they play it baby
I start right into cryin
Oh baby please dont leave me
Now Im gonna crawl across my bed baby
Cry myself to sleep
Yeah Im gonna crawl across my bed baby
Cry myself to sleep
And in my dreams I hear you saying
Lover please come back to me
