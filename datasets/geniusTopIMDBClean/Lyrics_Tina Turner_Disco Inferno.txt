 Burn baby burn baby burn 
Burn baby burn baby burn 
Burn baby burn baby burn 
Burn baby burn baby burn 
Burn baby burn burn 
Burn baby burn burn 
Burn baby burn  Disco inferno
Burn baby burn  Burn that mother down
Burn baby burn  Disco inferno
Burn baby burn  Burn that mother down
Burning 
To my surprise one hundred stories high
People getting loose now getting down on the roof
Folks screaming out of control
It was so entertaining when the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn  Disco inferno
Burn baby burn  Burn that mother down
Burn baby burn  Disco inferno
Burn baby burn  Burn that mother down
Burning 
Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldnt get enough so I had to selfdestruct
The heat was on rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn  Disco inferno
Burn baby burn  Burn that mother down
Burn baby burn  Disco inferno
Burn baby burn  Burn that mother down

 Burn burn 
Burn burn 
Burn burn 
Burn burn 
Burn burn 
Burning 
Burn burn 
Burn burn 
Burning 
Burn burn 
Burn burn 
Burning 
Burn burn 
Burn burn 
Up above my head
I hear music in the air
That makes me know
Theres a party somewhere
Just cant stop  When my spark gets hot
Just cant stop  When my spark gets hot
