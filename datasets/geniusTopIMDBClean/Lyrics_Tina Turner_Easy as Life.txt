This is the moment when the gods expect me
To beg for help but I wont even try
I want nothing in this world but myself to protect me
But I wont lie down roll over and die
All I have to do is to forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that loves an everchanging situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic would have died
Its easy its easy
Until I think about him as he was when I last saw him
And how he would have been were I to be with him today
Tender in his manner and myself consolation
All I ever wanted and Im throwing it away
Its easy its easy as life
All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the content of the familiar kind of start
Its easy its easy
And though Ill think about him until the earth draws in around me
And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love
This is no denial no betrayal but redemption
Redeemed in my allies and in the pantheon above
Its easy its easy its easy
