A one in a million chance
You know the moment that you cross over the line
A casual glance
No one has to read between the lines
In the south of France it was springtime
Special feelings come alive
Theres romance in the air so they say
Love could be a small cafe away
Love is a piece of cake
And making love is all there is to eat
But its a heart out of a limb
When you start to feel forever in a kiss
But you must remember theres no point of refuge
You only have a part in a lovers play
And you could be the one left in the dark
If someone takes a shortcut to your heart
And all too soon youre touching for the last time
No one has to tell you how it is
Its just a memory two people share
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it under foreign affairs
File it file it
