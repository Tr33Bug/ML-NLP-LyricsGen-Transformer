See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface in every shadow
On the wind I feel his breath
Golden eye I found his weakness
Golden eye hell do what I please
Golden eye no time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees
Youll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
Youll never know
How it feels to be the one whos left behind
Youll never know the days the nights
The tears the tears Ive cried
But now my time has come
And time time is not on your side
See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls they gather around him
If I had him I wouldnt let him out
Golden eye not lace or leather
Golden chain take him to the spot
Golden eye Ill show him forever
Itll take forever to see
What Ive got
Youll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
Youll never know
How it feels to get so close
And be denied
Its a gold and honey trap
Ive got for you tonight
Revenge its a kiss this time I wont miss
Now Ive got you in my sight
With a Golden eye
Golden golden eye
With a golden eye
Golden eye golden eye
Golden eye golden eye
