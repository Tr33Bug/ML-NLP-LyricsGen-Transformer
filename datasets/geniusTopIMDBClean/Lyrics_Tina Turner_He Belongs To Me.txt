Hes got everything He needs Hes an artist He dont look back 
He can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black
You will start out standing proud to steal her anything He sees 
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees
He never stumbles Hes got no place to fall 
Hes nobodys child the law cant touch her at all
He wears an Egyptian ring it sparkles before He speaks 
Hes a hypnotist collector you are a walking antique
Bow down to her on Sunday salute her when her birthday comes 
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum
