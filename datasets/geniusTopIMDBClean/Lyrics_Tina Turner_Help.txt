When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybodys help in any way
But now these days are gone Im not so self assured
Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Wont you please please help me
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like Ive never did before
Help me if you can Im feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Wont you please please help me

Help me get my feet back on the ground

Oh please please
Wont you please help me Ooh
