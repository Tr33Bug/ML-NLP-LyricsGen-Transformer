I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Because hes not here with me
Hey window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that weve parted
Theres one sound that I just cant stand
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Because heres not here with me
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that weve parted
Theres one sound that I just cant stand
I cant stand the rain cant stand the rain
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Because heres not here with me
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that weve parted
Theres one sound that I just cant stand


I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
It just keeps on holding me
Get off of my window
Because heres not here with me
I cant stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
