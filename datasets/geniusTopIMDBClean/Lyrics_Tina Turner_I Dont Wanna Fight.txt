Theres a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Oh like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
Its not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me Im getting stronger
We must stop pretending I cant live this life
I dont care whos wrong or right
I dont really wanna fight no more
Too much talking babe
Lets sleep on it tonight
I dont really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesnt bother me
Cant you see that I dont care
Or are you looking right through me
It seems to me that lately  Seems to me that lately 
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe  Could it be that maybe 
This crazy situation is the reason why
I dont care whos wrong or right
I dont really wanna fight no more
Too much talking babe
Lets sleep on it tonight
I dont really wanna fight no more
Time for letting go
Oh baby dont you know
That I dont wanna hurt no more
Its time Im walking babe
Dont care now whos to blame
I dont really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
Oh dont wanna hurt no more


Oh baby dont you know
No I dont wanna hurt no more
Too much talking babe
Dont care now whos to blame
I dont really wanna fight no more
I dont care whos wrong or right
I dont really wanna fight no more
Its time Im walking babe
So lets sleep on it tonight
I dont really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
No I dont wanna hurt no more
Too much hey baby
Dont care now whos to blame
I dont really wanna fight no more
Cause this is time for letting go
Let it go let it go let it go
Let it go let it go let it go
Hmm so let it go
