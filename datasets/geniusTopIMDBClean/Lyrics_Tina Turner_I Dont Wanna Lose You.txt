Women of a certain age
They learn to rely and your job is responses
Having played the mating game
She doesnt waste time cause
All that she wants is
Real and honest devotion
Want here cant help her show
Though I hardly know your name
I know about love and I know
I dont wanna lose you
I dont even wanna say goodbye oh no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love true love
Women who have made mistakes are a little afraid
They dont like taking chances
She will play the waiting game
Shes never impressed by those madly amasses
I know Ive only just met you
Baby I should know better
But when you look at me that way
Theres something inside thats so right
I dont wanna lose you
I dont even wanna say goodbye oh no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love true love
I dont wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way oh yeah
Cause every time Im with you I feel
True love true love true love


Tell me youre real
Youre not pretending
Lets make a deal
Cause my hearts depending on you
Oh baby
I dont wanna lose you
I dont even wanna say goodbye oh no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love true love
I dont wanna lose you
And I always wanna feel this way oh yeah
Cause every time Im with you I feel
True love true love true love
I dont wanna lose you
I dont even wanna say goodbye oh no
I just wanna hold on to this
True love true love
I dont wanna lose you
And I always want to feel this way
Cause every time Im with you I feel
True love true love true love
