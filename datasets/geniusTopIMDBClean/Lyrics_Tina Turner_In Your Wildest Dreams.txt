Oh baby oh baby
The sun goes down and the moon comes up
My heart is pumping for you and the mad thing starts yeah
Ohhoyeah never in your wildest dreams
Did you ever get this feeling
Never in your wildest dreams oh no
Never in your wildest dreams could it ever be this easy
Never in your wildest dreams oh no
Oh baby oh baby
The night is hot outside your window
I hear people walking people talking
I smell your skin I feel you breathing
Dont let me go not yet not yet not yet
Oh baby oh baby
The world is slowly turning
As it turns I see your face touch your eyes your lips space space
Weve arrived at the place where they open the hearts
And fill them up with love filled with love filled with love
This ones pumping for you as the mad thing starts
text in    translated sung by Antonio Banderas in Spanish
Weve arrived at the place where they open the hearts
And fill them up with love filled with love filled with love
This ones pumping for you
