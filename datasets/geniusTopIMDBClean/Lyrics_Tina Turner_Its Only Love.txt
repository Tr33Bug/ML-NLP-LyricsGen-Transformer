When the feeling is ended
There aint no use pretending
Dont you worry its only love
When your world has been shattered
Aint nothing else matters
It aint over its only love
And thats all
When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It aint easy but its only love
And if your life aint worth living
And youre ready to give in
Just remember that its only love
Yeah thats all
You can live without the aggravation
You gotta wanna win you gotta wanna win
You keep looking back in desperation
Over and over and over again
