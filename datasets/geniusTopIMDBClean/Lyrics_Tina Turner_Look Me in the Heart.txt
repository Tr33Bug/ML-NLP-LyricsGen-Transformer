Last night we tried to touch
But we never got close
Last night we tried to talk
The words got caught in our throats
When we finally fell asleep
We couldnt have been further apart
Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby look me in the heart
And youll see that Im so crazy about you baby
And its not in my mind
Cant you look me in the heart
Look me in the heart
You try to say that Im hiding from you
You act like a spy always looking for clues
Youve read about my past
But why dont we try to make a new start
Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby look me in the heart
And youll see that Im so crazy about you baby
And its not in my mind
Cant you look me in the heart
Look me in the heart
I remember how good we used to be together
I can remember baby
So be tender baby
Remember the love
We said would last forever
I know we can make it like that again
Look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby look me in the heart
And youll see that Im so crazy about you baby
And its not in my mind
Cant you look me in the heart
Look me look me in the heart
If you think that love is blind
Baby look me in the heart
And youll see that Im so crazy about you baby
And its not in my mind
Cant you look me in the heart
Look me in the heart
Look me in my heart in my heart in my heart
