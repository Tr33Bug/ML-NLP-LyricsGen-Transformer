Every time I think of you I always catch my breath
And Im still standing here and youre miles away
And Im wondering why you left
And theres a storm thats raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And its almost driving me wild
And theres a heart thats breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I aint missing you at all  missing you 
Since youve been gone away  missing you 
I aint missing you  missing you 
No matter what I might say  missing you 
Theres a message in the wire
And Im sending the signal tonight
You dont know how desperate Ive become
And it looks like Im losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though Im trying hard to understand
And its my heart thats breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I aint missing you at all  missing you 
Since youve been gone away  missing you 
I aint missing you  missing you 
No matter what I might say  missing you 
Theres a message that Im sending out
Via telegraph to your soul
And if I cant breach this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload


I aint missing you at all  missing you 
Since youve been gone away  missing you 
I aint missing you  missing you 
No matter what my friends say  missing you 
I aint missing you
I aint missing you I cant lie to myself
And theres a storm thats raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I aint missing you at all
I aint missing youmissing you
I aint missing you oh no
I aint missing you I aint missing you
I aint missing you I aint missing you
I aint missing you I aint missing you
I aint missing you
Everytime I think of you I always catch my breath
