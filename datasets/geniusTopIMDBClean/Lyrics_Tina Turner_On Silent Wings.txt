There was a time when I would have followed you
To the ends of the earth
I was willing to share it all with you
The love the hurt
Ive seen you when your dreams
Were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on tooh
You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings silent wings
You cant hide what you you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
Silent wings
I can see us in our dreams and were dancing
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered
But we both know were just hanging on
Oh I feel the shame
But Ill never know the reason why
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me oh its just a memory
You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings silent wings
You cant hide what you you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
Silent wings

You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings silent wings
You cant hide what you you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
Silent wings
Silent wingsoh
Silent wingsoh
No more promises to break
Oh our love has slipped away
Silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wing
Silent wings oh
Never be the same againsilent wings silent wings
