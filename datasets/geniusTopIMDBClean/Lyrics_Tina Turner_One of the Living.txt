In the desert sun evry step that you take could be the final one
And in the burning heat
Hanging on the edge of destruction
No
You cant stop the pain of your children crying out in your head
They always said that the living would envy the dead
So now youre gonna shoot
Shoot bullets of fire
Dont wanna fight
But sometimes youve got to
Youre some soul survivor
And theres just one thing youve got to know
Youve got ten more thousand miles to go because youre
One of the living  and if you cant stick together
Well
Youre one of the living  whos gonna make it tonight 
Walk tall
Cool
Collected
But savage
Walk tall
Bruised
Sensual
Ravaged
Its evry man for himself
Evry woman
Evry child
A new breed
Ferocious and wild
And all they wanna do is shoot bullets of fire
They wanna fight
But sometimes youve got to
Youre some soul survivor
And theres just one thing youve got to know
Youve got ten more thousand miles to go because youre
One of the living  and if you cant stick together
Well
Youre one of the living  whos gonna make it tonight 
Youre one of the living  and if we cant stick together
Well
Youre one of the living  whos gonna make it tonight 
Shoot bullets of fire
Youre one of the living  and if we cant stick together
Youre one of the living  and if we cant stick together
Youre one of the living  and if we cant stick together
