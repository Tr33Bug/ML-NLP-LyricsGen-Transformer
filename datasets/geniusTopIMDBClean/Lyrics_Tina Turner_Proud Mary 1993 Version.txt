Proud Mary  1993 Version  LyricsYou know every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
But theres just one thing you see
We never ever do nothing
Nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
But were gonna take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
But then were gonna do the finish rough
The way we do Proud Mary
Rollin rollin rollin on the river 
Listen to the story
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
I werent worryin bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin
Ooh the Proud Mary keep on burnin
And were rollin  rolling  rollin yeah  rolling 
Rollin on the river  rolling on the river 
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I  Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
You know that  Big wheel keep on turnin
Ooh the Proud Mary keep on burnin
And were rollin  rolling  rollin yeah  rolling 
Rollin on the river  rolling on the river 
I said were rollin  rolling  rollin  rolling 
Rollin on the river  rolling on the river 
Oh I left a good job in the city
Workin for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin
Worryin bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin  turnin 
Proud Mary keep on burnin  burnin 
Rollin  yeah  rollin  alright 
Rollin on the river  go ahead now 
Rollin  alright  rollin  yeah 
Rollin on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis yall
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Till I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
Big wheel keep on turnin  turnin 
Proud Mary keep on burnin  burnin 
Rollin  alright  rollin  yeah 
Rollin on the river  go ahead now 
Rollin rollin
Rollin on the river
If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
You dont have to worry if you got no money
The people on the river are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turnin  turnin 
Proud Mary keep on burnin  burnin 
Rollin  rollin  rollin  yeah 
Rollin on the river  alright now 
Rollin rollin
