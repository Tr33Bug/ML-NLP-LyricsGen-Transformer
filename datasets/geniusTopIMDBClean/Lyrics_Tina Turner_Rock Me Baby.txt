Rock me baby rock me all night long
I said I want you to
Rock me baby rock me all night long
I want you to rock me like my back aint got no bones
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough
Want you to
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough
I want you to roll me till I wont no more
When you see me coming go get your rockin chair
When you see me coming go get your rockin chair
I want you to rock me rock me away from here
Rock me baby rock me all night long
I said I want you to
Rock me baby rock me all night long
I want you to rock me like my back aint got no bones
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough
I said I want you to
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough
I want you to roll me till I wont no more
