I made a resolution and I plan to keep my word
But I need you to make it work
Youve got to read the message
Understand whats on my mind
Cause not to see would be a crime
And we could lose it anytime
Weve got to show some respect
Weve got to learn to protect
Dont take it for granted I know
That if you want to stay close
Weve got to show some respect
But I believe in working then I believe in a little help
Cause Im not a light unto myself
Without a thing of value why settle for second best
We dont know whats up ahead
And we cant let ourselves forget
Weve got to show some respect
Weve got to learn to protect
Dont take it for granted I know
That if you want to stay close
Weve got to show some respect
For the things that I love about you
From the woman that you see inside
Dont let it walk out the door
Love follows every time
Weve got to show some respect
Weve got to learn to protect
Dont take it for granted I know
That if you want to stay close
Weve got to show some respect
