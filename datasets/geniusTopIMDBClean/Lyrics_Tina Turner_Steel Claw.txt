Its the story of a steel claw
Its just a television wonderland
Just one more
Fairy tale about some rich bitch
Lying by the swimming pool
Life is so cruel
Easy living when you make the rules
Last Friday was the first time
It took only about half a minute
On the stairway
It was childs play
The odds turn out even
When you give up believing in the
Cold law steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way no way
Dont try to get out or therell be hell to pay
I dont know whos right whos wrong
But it really doesnt matter when youre lying in the gutter
Its a seesaw
A long hot battle with the cold law
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw
The politicians have forgotten this place
Except for flying visits in a black Mercedes
At election time
They cross the line
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime
If they could see whats going on around here
So many people hanging on the edge
Crying out for revolution
Retribution
The odds turn out even
When you give up believing in the
Cold law steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way no way
Dont try to get out or therell be hell to pay
I dont know whos right whos wrong
But it really doesnt matter when youre lying in the gutter
Its a seesaw
A long hot battle with the cold law
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw
Sometimes I think Im going crazy
Sometimes I do a line makes me laugh
Makes me want to take a joyride
On the high tide
Sometimes Im contemplating suicide
Meanwhile Eddys on the West Coast now
Hes making out with some sweet seorita
Up in Frisco you and I know
The odds turn out even
When you give up believing in the
Cold law steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way no way
Dont try to get out or therell be hell to pay
I dont know whos right whos wrong
But it really doesnt matter when youre lying in the gutter
Its a seesaw
A long hot battle with the cold law
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw
Its cold law steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way no way
Cold law
When you give up believing in the cold law steel claw
