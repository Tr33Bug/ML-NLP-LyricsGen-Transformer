 Verse 1   
I call you
When I need you
My hearts on fire
You come to me
Come to me
Wild and wired
Oh you come to me
Give me everything I need
You bring a lifetime of promises
And a world of dreams
You speak the language of love
Like you know what it means
And it cant be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong
Chorus   
Youre simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Im stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh tear us apart baby
Baby I would rather be dead
Verse 2   
In your heart I see
The start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost
I get washed away
Just as long as Im here in your arms
I could be in no better place
Chorus   
Youre simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh Im stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh tear us apart no no
Baby I would rather be dead

 Bridge   
Each time you leave me
I start losing control
Youre walking away
With my heart and my soul
I can feel it even when Im alone
Oh baby dont let go
Chorus  
Youre the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh Im stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh tear us apart no no
Baby I would rather be dead
Outro  
Youre the best
