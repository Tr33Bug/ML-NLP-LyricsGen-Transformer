I call you when I need you my hearts on fire
You come to me come to me wild and wired
Ooh you come to me give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
Mm and it cant be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong baby
Youre simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Im stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart No no
Baby I would rather be dead
In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes I get lost I get washed away
Just as long as Im here in your arms
I could be in no better place
Youre simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh Im stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh tear us apart No no
Baby I would rather be dead
Each time you leave me I start losing control
Youre walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when Im alone
Oh baby dont let go
Oh youre the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Ooh Im stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Oh tear us apart No no
Baby I would rather be dead
Youre the best
Oh youre simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Im stuck on your heart baby
I hang on every word you say
Oh tear us apart No no
Baby I would rather be dead
Oh youre the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
Oh youre the best
