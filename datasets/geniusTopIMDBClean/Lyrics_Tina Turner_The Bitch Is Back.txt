I was justified when I was five
Raising cane I spit in your eye
Times are changing now the poor get fat
But the fevers gonna catch you when the bitch gets back
Eat meat on Friday thats alright
Even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social dos
I get high from the speaking about the things I do
Im a bitch Im a bitch
Im a bitch and Im back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
Because Im better than you
Its the way that I move
The things that I do
I entertain by picking brains
Sell my soul by dropping names
I dont like those my god whats that
Oh its full of nasty habits when the bitch gets back
Im a bitch Im a bitch
Im a bitch and Im back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
Because Im better than you
Its the way that I move
The things that I do
Im a bitch Im a bitch
Im a bitch and Im back
Stone cold sober as a matter of fact
I can bitch I can bitch
Because Im better than you
Its the way that I move
The things that I do
