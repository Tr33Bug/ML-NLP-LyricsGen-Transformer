Im talking to the priest
The high priest
And everybody out there in the universe
If what Im saying is wrong
Then tell me the right way to say it
Cause I wanna be made over
Paint me red paint me green
Give me liberty wash me clean
Make me over make me nice
Cause when Im done Lord I wanna be right
Hey Lord
Make me over I wanna be made over
Hey Lord
Make me over I wanna be made over
Make me smart make me king
Give a lot give me steam
I want eternal beauty spiritual things
Cause when Im done yes I wanna be a good thing
Hey Lord
Make me over I wanna be made over
Hey Lord
Make me over I wanna be made over
I wanna go places I wanna do some things
I wanna be a star I wanna have a big name
But in my heart let beauty reign
And when Im done I wanna have fame
Lord make me nice Lord make me good
Give me power give me love
I wanna be desireable voluptous tenderlized
