Two people living on the edge of life
Are people running out of dreams and time
I can hear it when you tell me so
And I can feel it but I cant let go
Two people got to stick together
And love one another save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day
Two people living in the way we do
Are people trying to keep a love anew
What to say to make some sense of it
And what to do to make the feeling fit
Ill come running to your rescue
You got to stand by me
Theres a lot of love between us
And we should never let go oh
Two people stick together
One another save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whatever
