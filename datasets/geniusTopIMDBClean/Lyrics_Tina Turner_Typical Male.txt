Tell me lawyer what to do
I think Im falling in love with you
Defend me from the way I feel
Wont you give me some advice
On how to handle my private life
Im sure that we can make a deal
I confess Im a fool for men
With a clever mind
But your intellect aint no match
For this heart of mine
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
Im just using my female attraction
On a typical male on a typical male
Your sense of justice Ill embrace
But your defense dont help my case
Im deep in trouble with the law
Something about authority
Seems to bring out the bad in me
Hey lawyer got to catch me when I fall
Oh they say that you match your wits
With the best of them
But I know when Im close youre just
Like the rest of them
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
Im just using my female attraction
On a typical male on a typical male
So put your books aside
Loosen off the suit and tie
And open up your heart and let me in
Now open up your heart and let me in
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
Im just using my female attraction
On a typical male on a typical male
The reaction
Im just using my feminine charm
On a typical male on a typical
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
Im just using my female attraction
On a typical male on a typical male
A little reaction
Im just using my female attraction
