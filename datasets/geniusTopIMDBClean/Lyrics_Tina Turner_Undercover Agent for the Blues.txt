He was my lover he was working undercover
Fella knew all of the moves
He really had me romping we were bare foot stomping
He just kept igniting my fuse
He was blinded by the blackness of my long silk stockings
He was rocking with an optical illusion
And this aint how I thought itd be
He just kept on keeping me in a state of total confusion
He took me for a ride rattled me down to my shoes
But I found out he was an undercover agent for the blues yeah
He never really needed love from any direction no
I was just an innocent bystander
He just kept getting kinkier hook line and sinker
Jujujust too hot to handle
He took me by storm must have been a season for the fools
So bad he was an undercover agent for the blues
For the blues 
Undercover agent
Undercover for the blues
For the blues
Undercover agent
