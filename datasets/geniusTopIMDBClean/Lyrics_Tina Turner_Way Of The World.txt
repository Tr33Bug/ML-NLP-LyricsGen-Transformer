Baby i need a hand to hold tonight
And one bright star to remind me
How dear is this life
Baby ive never known anyone like you
Theres something very special about you
I cant imagine living without you
Its the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And youre holding me tight
You capture the beat of my heart
In my heart theres a fire thats burning
And there isnt a thing i can do
Im resigned to the fact
That theres no turning back
And ill never regret loving you
Baby i will go anywhere you lead
As long as youre there beside me
Baby thats all i need
Hold me hold me and never let me go
Im always gonna care about you
I never want to be without you
Youre everything i believe in
Dont ever lose the feeling
Dont ever lose the feeling no
Its the way of the world and its motion
And no ocean can keep us apart
When the moment is right
And youre holding me tight
