We Dont Need Another Hero  Thunderdome  Lyrics
Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Cant make the same mistake this time
We are the children the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear until nothing else remains
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome
Looking for something we can rely on
Theres gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear until nothing else remains
All the children say
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome
So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing
We dont need another hero
We dont need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome
