Some boys just got the look of a Greek Adonis
An some boys just try to talk you off your feet
Some boys think theyre Gods gift to woman
An some boys just think theyre sweet enough to eat
I change the habit of a lifetime
Dont even try
Cause when you cut down deeper than the icing
You realize
What you get is what you see
Aint nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I dont want your kind of love
Some guys just got lips that you cant help kissing
And some guys just got a smile you cant resist
Some guys just got to build a reputation
They just wanna add you to the list
You got a lot of physical attraction
I cant deny but can you guarantee me satisfaction
While Im still waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting oohhh
What you get is what you see
Aint nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I dont want your kind of love
So let me see your cards on the table
Before I buy
I always read the writing on the label
So give me reason to believe
Theres more to you than meets the eye
What you get is what you see
Aint nothing more to it
And if you wanna love a woman like me
It takes a man to do it
If what you get is what you see
Then I dont want your kind of love


Aint nothing more to it
Doesnt matter doesnt matter at all
I dont want your kind of love
Aint nothing else to it
I dont want your kind of love oooohh
What you get is what you see
