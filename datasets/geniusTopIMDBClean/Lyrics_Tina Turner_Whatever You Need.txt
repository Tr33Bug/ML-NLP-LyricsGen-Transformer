In what other lives have I known your kiss
And what forgotten moments have I felt like this
The way you touch me I come undone
You know me more than anyone
Whatever you want
In what other lives have I touched your face
And what words did we whisper in a strange forbidden place
To be with you baby is to find myself
Were two of a kind you and I
I couldnt love anyone else
You are my beginning my end
You are my lover my friend
In this life in this time
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here waiting baby baby baby
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here waiting yeah yeah yeah
In what other lives did I feel your skin
And when exactly did I breathe you in
Feel like Ive known you for a thousand years
Youre so familiar to me and there is no fear
You are my beginning my end
You are my lover my friend
In this life in this time
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here waiting baby baby baby
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here waiting yeah yeah yeah


Watch the sun go down yeah yeah
My past and future in you are bound oh yeah
I watch as time moves on Im alive and strong
And when Im with you theres no right no wrong
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here waiting baby baby baby
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here  right here waiting waiting baby
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here waiting baby baby baby
Whatever you want whatever you need
I will be right here waiting yeah yeah yeah
Right here right here waiting
