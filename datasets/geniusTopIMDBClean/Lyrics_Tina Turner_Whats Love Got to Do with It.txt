You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That its only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
Its physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Whats love but a secondhand emotion
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
It may seem to you that Im acting confused
When youre close to me
If I tend to look dazed Ive read it someplace
Ive got cause to be
Theres a name for it
Theres a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me
Oh
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Whats love but a secondhand emotion
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
Ive been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
Ive been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Whats love but a secondhand emotion
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Whats love but a sweet oldfashioned notion
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
Whats love got to do ooh  got to do with it
Whats love but a secondhand emotion
Whats love got to do got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
Whats love
Got to do it
Got to do it
Whats love
