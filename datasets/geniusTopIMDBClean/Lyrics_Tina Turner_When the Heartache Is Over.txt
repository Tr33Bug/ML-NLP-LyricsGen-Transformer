Once in a lifetime you find
Someone to show you the way
Someone to make your decisions
But I let you lead me astray
Who did you think you were fooling
Said you were missing me blind
But the truth is I knew you were lying
You were using me time after time
When the heartache is over
I know I wont be missing you
Wont look over my shoulder
Cause I know that I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you
Time to move on with my life now
Leaving the past all behind
I can make my own decisions
It was only a matter of time
Sometimes I look back in anger
Thinking about all the pain
But I know that Im stronger without you
And that Ill never need you again
Live without you
I can live without you
