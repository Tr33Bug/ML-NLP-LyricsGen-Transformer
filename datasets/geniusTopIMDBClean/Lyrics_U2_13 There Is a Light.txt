13  There Is a Light  Lyrics
And if the terrors of the night
Come creeping into your days
And the world comes stealing children from your room
Guard your innocence from hallucination
And know that darkness always gathers around the light
If there is a light
We cant always see
If there is a world
We cant always be
If there is a dark
Now we shouldnt doubt
And there is a light
Dont let it go out
When the wind screams and shouts
And the sea is a dragons tail
And the ship that stole your heart away
Sets sail
When all youve left is leaving
And all you got is grieving
And all you know is needing
If there is a light
We cant always see
If there is a world
We cant always be
If there is a dark
Now we shouldnt doubt
And there is a light
Dont let it go out
Cause this is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
I know the world is dumb
But you dont have to be
Ive got a question for the child in you before it leaves
Are you tough enough to be kind
Do you know your heart has its own mind
Darkness gathers around the light
Hold on
Hold on
There is a light
We cant always see
If there is a world
We cant always be
If there is a dark
That we shouldnt doubt
And there is a light
Dont let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
