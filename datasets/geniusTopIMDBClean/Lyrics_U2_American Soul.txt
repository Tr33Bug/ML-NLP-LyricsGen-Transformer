Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward
Its not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Look around look around
Look around its a sound
Look around look around
Its a sound
Its not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
Its not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrims face
It had your heart to call her home
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you cant be sleepin


You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American
Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late but we still gotta try
Theres a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie  the lie the lie 
Theres a promise in the heart of every good dream
Its a call to action not to fantasy
The end of a dream the start of whats real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
RefuJesus
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American soul
American soul
