If you twist and turn away
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could yes I would
If I could I would let it go
Surrender dislocate
If I could throw this lifeless lifeline to the wind
Leave this heart of clay see you walk walk away
Into the night and through the rain
Into the half light and through the flame
If I could through myself set your spirit free
Id lead your heart away see you break break away
Into the light and to the day
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
To let it go and so to fade away
To let it go and so fade away
Im wide awake
Im wide awake wide awake
Im not sleeping
Oh no no no
If you should ask then maybe
Theyd tell you what I would say
True colours fly in blue and black
Blue silken sky and burning flag
Colours crash collide in bloodshot eyes
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo
Hoo hoo

If I could you know I would
If I could I would let it go
This desperation dislocation
Separation condemnation
Revelation in temptation
Isolation desolation
Let it go and so fade away
To let it go oh yeah and so fade away
To let it go oh no and so to fade away
Im wide awake Im wide awake
Wide awake Im not sleeping
Oh no no no
