California then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well thats what took me where I need to be
Which is here out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California at the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does
Oh all I know
And all I need to know
Is there is no yeah there is no end to love
I didnt call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyones a star in our town
Its just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom in a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
Ive seen for myself
Theres no end to grief
Thats how I know
Whoa thats how I know
And why I need to know
That there is no yeah there is no end to love
Whoa all I know and all I need to know
Is there is no yeah there is no end to love
Oh all I know
And all I need to know is there is no yeah there is no end to love
Whoa we come and go
Stolen days you dont give back
Stolen days are just enough
