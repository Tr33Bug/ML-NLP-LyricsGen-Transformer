The more you see the less you know
The less you find out as you go
I knew much more then than I do now
Neon heart dayglo eyes a city lit by fireflies
Theyre advertising in the skies for people like us
And I miss you when youre not around
Im getting ready to leave the ground
Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Oh you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights
Dont look before you laugh
Look ugly in a photograph
Flash bulbs purple irises the camera cant see
Ive seen you walk unafraid
Ive seen you in the clothes you made
Can you see the beauty inside of me
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me
And I miss you when youre not around
Im getting ready to leave the ground
Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
Oh you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights
Time time time time
Time wont leave me as I am
But time wont take the boy out of this man


Oh you look so beautiful tonight
Oh you look so beautiful tonight
Oh you look so beautiful tonight
In the city of blinding lights
The more you know the less you feel
Some pray for others steal
Blessings are not just for the ones who kneel
Luckily
