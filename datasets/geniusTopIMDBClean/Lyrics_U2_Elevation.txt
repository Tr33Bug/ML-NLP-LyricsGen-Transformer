High higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse you elevate my soul
Ive got no selfcontrol
Been living like a mole
Now going down excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high elevation
A star lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I cant sing but Ive got soul
The goal is elevation
Ive lost all selfcontrol
Been living like a mole
Now going down excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high elevation
Love lift me out of these blues
Wont you tell me something true
I believe in you
A mole digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Going down excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high elevation


Elevation
Elevation
Elevation
Elevation
