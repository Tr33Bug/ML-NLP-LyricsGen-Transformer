Get out of your own way hey hey
Get out of your own way hey hey
Love hurts
Now youre the girl whos left with no words
Your hearts a balloon but then it bursts
It doesnt take a cannon just a pin
Your skins not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous the glamorous the kiss
A fist listen to this oh
Get out of your own way oh I
Get out of your own way oh I
I could sing it to you all night all night
If I could Id make it alright alright
Nothings stopping you except whats inside
I can help you but its your fight your fight
Fight back
Dont take it lyin down you got to bite back
The face of libertys starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin for someone to lead them
The masters lookin for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincolns ghost said
Get out of your own way oh I
Get out of your own way oh I


I could sing it to you all night all night
If I could Id make it alright alright
Nothings stopping you except whats inside
I can help you but its your fight your fight
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain
