Its like the room just cleared of smoke
I didnt even want the heart you broke
Its yours to keep
You just might need one
I finally found my real name
I wont be me when you see me again
No I wont be my fathers son
Im more than you know
Im more than you see here
More than you let me be
Im more than you know
A body in a soul
You dont see me but you will
I am not invisible
Thats right
Ill be in the invisible world 
I dont dream not as such
I dont even think about you that much
Unless I start to think at all
All those frozen days
And your frozen ways
They melt away your face like snow
Im more than you know
Im more than you see here
Im more than you let me be
Im more than you know
A body in a soul
You dont see me but you will
I am not invisible
I am here
There is no them
There is no them
Theres only us
Theres only us
There is no them
There is no them
Theres only us
Theres only us
There is no them
There is no them
Theres only you
And theres only me
There is no them
