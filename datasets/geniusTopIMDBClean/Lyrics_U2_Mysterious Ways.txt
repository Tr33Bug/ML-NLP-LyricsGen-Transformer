Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
Youve been living underground eating from a can
Youve been running away from what you dont understand love
Shes slippy youre sliding down
Shell be there when you hit the ground
Its alright its alright its alright
She moves in mysterious ways
Its alright its alright its alright
She moves in mysterious ways oh
Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you cant explain
To touch is to heal to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky better learn how to kneel
On your knees boy
Shes the wave she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child
Its alright its alright alright
She moves in mysterious ways oh
Its alright its alright alright
She moves in mysterious ways oh
Its alright Its alright alright
Lift my days light up my nights oh
One day youll look back and youll see
Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling
Its alright its alright alright
She moves in mysterious ways
Its alright Its alright alright
She moves in mysterious ways oh
Its alright Its alright alright 
Move you spirits move you
Move spirits its move you oh yeah
Does it move you
She moves with it
Lift my days and light up my nights oh
We move through miracle days
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
She moves with it
She moves with it
Lift my days light up my nights
