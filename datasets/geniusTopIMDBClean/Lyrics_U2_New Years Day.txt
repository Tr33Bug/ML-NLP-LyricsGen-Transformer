Yeah
All is quiet on New Years Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Years Day
On New Years Day
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined the chosen few
The newspaper says says
Say its true its true
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one
I I will begin again
I I will begin again
Oh
Maybe the time is right
Oh maybe tonight
I will be with you again
I will be with you again


And so were told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes
On New Years Day
On New Years Day
On New Years Day
