Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame
You say one love one life
When its one need in the night
One love we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you dont care for it
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well its too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
Were one but were not the same
We get to carry each other carry each other
One
Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much More than a lot
You gave me nothing now its all I got
Were one but were not the same
Well we hurt each other then we do it again
You say love is a temple love a higher law
Love is a temple love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I cant be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love one blood
One life you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters brothers
One life but were not the same
We get to carry each other carry each other
One
One
Oohoohooh
Ohooh
May we may we may we get
Higher
Oh higher
Ay yeah go  higher
Oh  Higher
