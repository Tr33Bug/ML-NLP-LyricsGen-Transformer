The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty thats been lost before
Wants to find us again
I cant fight you anymore
Its you Im fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones
We cant fall any further
If we cant feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we cant deal with ordinary love
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
Well build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldnt wash it away
Cause we cant fall any further
If we cant feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we cant deal with ordinary love
Are we tough enough
For ordinary love


We cant fall any further
If we cant feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we cant deal with ordinary love
We cant fall any further
If we cant feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we cant deal with ordinary love
