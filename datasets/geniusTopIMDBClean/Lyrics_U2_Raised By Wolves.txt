Face down on a broken street
Theres a man in the corner in a pool of misery
Im in white van as a red sea covers the ground
Metal crash I cant tell what it is
But I take a look and now Im sorry I did
530 on a Friday night 33 good people cut down
I dont believe anymore
I dont believe anymore
Face down on a pillow of shame
Theres some girls with a needle trying to spell my name
My bodys not a canvas
My bodys now a toilet wall
I dont believe anymore
I dont believe anymore
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
Boy sees his father crushed under the weight
Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate
Blue mink Ford Im gonna detonate and youre dead
Blood in the house
Blood on the street
The worst things in the world are justified by belief
Registration 1385WZ
I dont believe anymore
I dont believe anymore
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
