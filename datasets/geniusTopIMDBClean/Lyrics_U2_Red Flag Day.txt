I am made of all that Im afraid of
Im most afraid of losing you
Hells a season
Youre the reason that I even dreamt of getting through
I I can feel your body shaking
I I will meet you where the waves are breaking
Baby its a Red Flag Day
Baby lets get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where weve never been before
Baby its a Red Flag Day
Baby lets go a bit further
Paradise is a place
You cant see when its yours
Red Flag Day
Red Flag Day
Sun comes here and oceanic feeling
Sky will soon be clear
Today we cant afford to be afraid of what we fear
I I can feel your body shaking
I I will meet you where the waves are breaking
Baby its a Red Flag Day
Baby lets get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where weve never been before
Baby its a Red Flag Day
Baby lets go a bit further
Paradise is a place
You cant see when its yours
Red Flag Day
Baby its a Red Flag Day
Red Flag Day
Not even news today
So many lost in the sea last night
One word that the sea cant say
Is no no no no
Baby its a Red Flag Day
Red Flag Day
Baby its a Red Flag Day
Baby lets get in the water
