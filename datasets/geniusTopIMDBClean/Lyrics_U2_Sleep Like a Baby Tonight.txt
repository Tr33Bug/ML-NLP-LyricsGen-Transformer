Morning your toast your tea and sugar
Read about the politicians lover
Go through the day like knife through butter
Why dont you
You dress in the colors of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair
Youre gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone elses suicide
Youre gonna sleep like a  baby tonight
Dreams
Its a dirty business dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where theres no daylight theres no healing
Youre gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But youre gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Hope hope is where the door is
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one elses pain
Youre gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But youre gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird your dreams take flight
Like St Francis covered in light
Youre gonna sleep like a baby tonight
