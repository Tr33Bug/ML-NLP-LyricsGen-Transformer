Tough you think youve got the stuff
Youre telling me and anyone
Youre hard enough
You dont have to put up a fight
You dont have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You dont have to go it alone
And its you when I look in the mirror
And its you when I dont pick up the phone
Sometimes you cant make it on your own
We fight all the time
You and I thats alright
Were the same soul
I dont need I dont need to hear you say
That if we werent so alike
Youd like me a whole lot more
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You dont have to go it alone
And its you when I look in the mirror
And its you when I dont pick up the phone
Sometimes you cant make it on your own
I know that we dont talk
Im sick of it all
Can  you  hear  me  when  I 
Sing youre the reason I sing
Youre the reason why the opera is in me


Well hey now
Still Ive got to let you know
A house doesnt make a home
Dont leave me here alone
And its you when I look in the mirror
And its you that makes it hard to let go
Sometimes you cant make it on your own
Sometimes you cant make it
Best you can do is to fake it
Sometimes you cant make it on your own
