You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where Ive been
Youve got eyes that can see right through me
Youre not afraid of anything theyve seen
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I dont know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme
If there is a light you cant always see
And there is a world we cant always be
If there is a dark that we shouldnt doubt
And there is a light dont let it go out
And this is a song a song for someone
This is a song a song for someone
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
Youre breaking into my imagination
Whatevers in there its yours to take
I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night
If there is a light you cant always see
And there is a world we cant always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light dont let it go out
And this is a song a song for someone
This is a song this is a song for someone
And Im a long long way from your hill of Calvary
And Im a long way from where I was where I need to be
If there is a light you cant always see
And there is a world we cant always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light dont let it go out
