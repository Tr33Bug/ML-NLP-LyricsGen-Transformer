Im not afraid
Of anything in this world
Theres nothing you can throw at me
That I havent already heard
Im just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company
I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere baby
Youve got to get yourself together
Youve got stuck in a moment
And now you cant get out of it
Dont say that later will be better
Now youre stuck in a moment
And you cant get out of it
I will not forsake
The colors that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know its tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you dont really need now
My oh my


Youve got to get yourself together
Youve got stuck in a moment
And you cant get out of it
Oh love look at you now
Youve got yourself stuck in a moment
And you cant get out of it
I was unconscious halfasleep
The water is warm til you discover how deep
I wasnt jumping for me it was a fall
Its a long way down to nothing at all
Youve got to get yourself together
Youve got stuck in a moment
And you cant get out of it
Dont say that later will be better
Now youre stuck in a moment
And you cant get out of it
And if the night runs over
And if the day wont last
And if our way should falter
Along this stony pass
And if the night runs over
And if the day wont last
And if your way should falter
Along this stony pass
Its just a moment
This time will pass
