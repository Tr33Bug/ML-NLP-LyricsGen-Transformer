Yeah mhm
I cant believe the news today
Oh I cant close my eyes and make it go away
How long How long must we sing this song
How long How long
Cause tonight we can be as one tonight
Broken bottles under childrens feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I wont heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Alright lets go
And the battles just begun
Theres many lost but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers children brothers sisters torn apart
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday
How long How long must we sing this song
How long How long
Cause tonight we can be as one tonight


Sunday Bloody Sunday  Tonight tonight 
Sunday Bloody Sunday  Tonight tonight 
Come get some
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh wipe your tears away
Oh wipe your tears away
Sunday Bloody Sunday  Oh wipe your bloodshot eyes 
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday oh
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday oh
Yeah lets go
And its true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today the millions cry  Sunday Bloody Sunday 
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die  Sunday Bloody Sunday 
The real battle just begun  Sunday Bloody Sunday 
To claim the victory Jesus won  Sunday Bloody Sunday 
On
Sunday Bloody Sunday yeah yeah
Sunday Bloody Sunday
