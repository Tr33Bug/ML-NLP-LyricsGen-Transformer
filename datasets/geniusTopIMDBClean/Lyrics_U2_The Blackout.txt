A dinosaur wonders why it still walks the earth yeah
A meteor promises its not gonna hurt yeah
Earthquake always happen when youre in bed Fred
The house shakes maybe was it something I said Ned
Go easy on me easy on me brother
Go easy on me easy on me brother
When the lights go out throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out dont you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
Statues fall democracy is flat on its back Jack
We had it all and what we had is not coming back Zach
A big mouth says the people they dont wanna be free for free
The blackout is this an extinction event we see
Go easy on me easy on me brother
Go easy on me easy on me now
When the lights go out throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out dont you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
Blackout its clear who you are will appear
Blackout no fear so glad that we are all still here
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out dont you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
