Its no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
Its no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y know I dont see you when she walks in the room
Its no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
Its no secret that a liar wont believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So Im telling you child
A man will beg  Love we shine like a 
A man will crawl  Burning star 
On the sheer face of love  Were falling from 
Like a fly on a wall  The sky tonight 
Its no secret at all
Its no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
Its no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief
A man will rise  Love we shine like a 
A man will fall  Burning star 
From the sheer face of love  Were falling from 
Like a fly from a wall  The sky tonight 
Its no secret at all
Love we shine like a burning star
Were falling from the sky tonight
A man will rise  Love we shine like a 
A man will fall  Burning star 
From the sheer face of love  Were falling from 
Like a fly from a wall  The sky tonight 
Its no secret at all


Its no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploding cosa one mans lie
Look I gotta go yeah Im running outta change
Theres a lot of things if I could Id rearrange
