The night gave you a song
A light had been turned on
You walked out in the world
Like you belong there
As easy as a breeze
Each heart was yours to please
Is it only me who sees
Theres something wrong there
Oh la la Im not a ghost now
I can see you
You need to see me
Its the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
I saw you on the stairs
You didnt notice I was there
Thats cause you were talking at me
And not to me
You were high above the storm
A hurricane being born
This freedom it might cost you
Your liberty
Its the little things that give you away
The words you cannot say
Your big mouth in the way
Its the little things that tease and betray
Has the hunter now become the prey
Its the little things
The little things that give you away
Sometimes
I cant believe my existence
See myself from a distance
I cant get back inside
Sometimes
The air is so anxious
All my thoughts are so reckless
And all my innocence has died
Sometimes
I wake at four in the morning
Where all the darkness is swarming
And it covers me in fear
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Im full of anger and grieving
So far away from believing
That any sun will reappear
Sometimes
The end is not coming
Its not coming
The end is here
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
When the painted glass shatters
And youre the only thing matters
But I cant see you through the tears
Sometimes
The end is not coming
Its not coming
The end is here
Sometimes
