The Miracle  Of Joey Ramone  Lyrics
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise above the hurt
I was young not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound Id ever heard
We got language so we cant communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name
I was young not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound Id ever heard
We can hear you  hear you 
We can hear you
We can hear you  hear you ooh 
I woke up at the moment when the miracle had come
I get so many things I dont deserve
All the stolen voices will some day be returned
The most beautiful sound Id ever heard
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
