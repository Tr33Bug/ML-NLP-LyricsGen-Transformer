Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Til someone else was in control
You think its easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think its easier
To know your own tricks
Well its the hardest thing youll ever do
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But youre not my troubles anymore
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Til somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Til someone else was in control
You think its easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
And you think its easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me then and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But youre not my troubles anymore
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Til somebody else was in control  til someone else is in control 
Somebody stepped inside your soul  oh no 
Somebody stepped inside your soul  oh no 
Little by little they robbed and stole
Til somebody else was in control
God knows its not easy
Im taking on the shape of someone elses pain
God now you can see me
Im naked and Im not afraid my bodys
Sacred and Im not ashamed
Somebody stepped inside your soul  oh no 
Somebody stepped inside your soul  oh no 
Little by little they robbed and stole
Til somebody else was in control  til someone else is in control 
Somebody stepped inside your soul  oh no 
Somebody stepped inside your soul  oh no 
Little by little they robbed and stole
Til someone else was in control  someone else is in control
