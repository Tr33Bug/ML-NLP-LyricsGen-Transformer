Havent seen you in quite a while
I was down the hold just passing time
Last time we met it was a lowlit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time except you
You were talking about the end of the world
I took the money I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
And you know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You you were acting like it was the end of the world
In my dream I was drowning sorrows
But my sorrows theyd learned to swim
Surrounding me going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You you said youd wait till the end of the world
Love love love love love love
Love love love love love love
Love love love love love love
