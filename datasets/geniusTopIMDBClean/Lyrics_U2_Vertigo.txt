Unos dos tres catorce
Turn it up loud captain 
Lights go down its dark the jungle is your head
Cant rule your heart a feeling so much stron
ger than a thought your eyes are wide and though your soul
It cant be bought your mind can wander

The night is full of holes as bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold they twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll they know that they cant dance
At least they know
I cant stand the beats Im asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music swinging to the music
Ohohohohoh ohohohohoh
Ohohohohoh
