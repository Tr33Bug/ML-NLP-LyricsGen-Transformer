The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin to hold on
To what you used to be
Im so glad the past is all gone
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation
Oh volcano
You dont wanna you dont wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You dont wanna you dont wanna know
Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you dont see so well
The futures gonna land on you
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation
Oh volcano
You dont wanna you dont wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You dont wanna you dont wanna know
Youre on a piece of ground above a volcano
You were alone
And now youre not alone
You were alone
You are rock n roll
You and I are rock n roll
You are rock n roll
You and I are rock n roll
Oh volcano
You dont wanna you dont wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You dont wanna you dont wanna know
Youre on a piece of ground above a volcano
