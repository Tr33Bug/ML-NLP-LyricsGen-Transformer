And love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
And love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you cant leave behind
And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like its a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
And for a second you turn back
Oh no be strong
Walk on walk on
What you got they cant steal it
No they cant even feel it
Walk on walk on
Stay safe tonight
Youre packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been
A place that has to be believed to be seen
You could have flown away
A singing bird in an open cage
Who will only fly only fly for freedom
Walk on walk on
What youve got they cant deny it
Cant sell it or buy it
Walk on walk on
Stay safe tonight
And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on walk on
Home hard to know what it is if youve never had one
Home I cant say where it is but I know Im going home
Thats where the heart is
And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on walk on
Leave it behind
Youve got to leave it behind
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you steal
All this you can leave behind
All that you reason
All that you care
Its only time
And Ill never fill up all my mind
All that you sense
All that you speak
All you dress up
And all that you scheme
All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate
