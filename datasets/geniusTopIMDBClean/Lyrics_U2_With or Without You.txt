See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
Ill wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And Im waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you ahah
I cant live with or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give and you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give and you give
And you give yourself away


With or without you
With or without you ohh
I cant live with or without you
Hoohohoh hoohohoh
Hoohohohohohoh
With or without you
With or without you ohh
I cant live with or without you
With or without you
Hooohoohhoooohooh
Hooohoohhoooohooh
