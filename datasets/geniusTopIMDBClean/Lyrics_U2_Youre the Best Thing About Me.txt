When you look so good the pain in your face doesnt show
When you look so good and baby you dont even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars brighter as theyre vanishing
Oh youve seen enough to know its children who teach
Youre still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach
Youre the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
Youre the best thing about me
Im the kind of trouble that you enjoy
Youre the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
Youre the best thing about me
The best thing about me
I been crying out How bad can a good time be
Shooting off my mouth thats another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
Theres no risky thing for a man whos determined to fall
Youre the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
Youre the best thing about me
Im the kind of trouble that you enjoy
Youre the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
Youre the best thing about me
Why am I
Why am I walking away
Walking away
Why am I walking away
I can see it all so clearly
I can see what you cant see
I can see you love her loudly
When she needs you quietly


Youre the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
Youre the best thing about me
Why am I
Why am I walking away
Walking away
Why am I walking away
