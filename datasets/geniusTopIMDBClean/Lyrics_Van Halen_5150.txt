The love line is never straight and narrow
Unless your love is tried and true
We take a chance with new beginnings
Still we try win or lose
Take the highs with the blues
Always one more youre never satisfied
Instead of one for all with you its only one for me
Oh when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you dont know what that means
I feel like running politician
Just trying to please you all the time
Im giving you my share with no conditions
Going wide running long
Feeling lost but not for long
Always one more youre never satisfied
Instead of one for all with you its only one for me
Oh when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you dont know what that means
Always one more youre never satisfied
Instead of one for all with you its only one for me
Oh when I draw the line and meet you half the way
But you dont know what that means
