Well they say its kinda frightnin how this younger generation swings
You know its more than just some new sensation
Well the kid is into losin sleep and he dont come home for half the week
You know its more than just an aggravation
And the cradle will rock
Yes the cradle will rock
And I say rock on
Rock on
And when some local kid gets down they try and drum him out of town
They say You coulda least faked it boy
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets and hes unemployed
And the cradle will rock
Yeah the cradle will rock
And I say rock on
Rock on
Have you seen Juniors grades
And when some local kid gets down they try and drum him out of town
They say You coulda least faked it boy
Faked it boy
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets and hes unemployed
His folks are overjoyed
And the cradle will rock
Yeah the cradle will rock
And I say rock on
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on
