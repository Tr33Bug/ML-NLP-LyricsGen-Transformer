I am a victim of the science age uh
A child of the storm whoa yes
I cant remember when I was your age
For me times no more no more
Nobody rules these streets at night but me
The atomic punk
Whoa yeah wow
I am the ruler of these nether worlds
The underground whoa yes
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard
Just look around whoa yes
Nobody rules these streets at night but me
The atomic punk
Ooo Ahhh 
I am the ruler of these nether worlds
The underground oh oh
On every wall and place my fearsome name is heard
Look around whoa yeah
Nobody rules these streets at night but me nobody ah
The atomic punk
