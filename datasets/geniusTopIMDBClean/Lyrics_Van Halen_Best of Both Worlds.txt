I dont know what I been livin on but
Its not enough to fill me up
I need more than just words can say
I need everything this life can give me hey
Cause sometimes its not enough ow
Come on baby close your eyes let go
This can be everything weve dreamed
Its not work that makes it work on
Now let the magic do the work for you yes honey
Cause something reached out and touched me
Now I know all I want
I want the best of both worlds
And honey I know what its worth
If we could have the best of both worlds
Wed have heaven right here on Earth woo
Well theres a picture in a gallery
Fallen angel looked a lot like you
We forget where we come from sometimes
I had a dream it was really you
Something reached out and touched me
Now I know all I want
I want the best of both worlds
And honey I know what its worth
If we could have the best of both worlds
A little bit of heaven right here on Earth yeah


Woah you dont have to die and go to Heaven
Or hang around to be born again
Just tune in to what this place has got to offer
Cause we may never be here again ow
I want the best of both worlds
And honey I know what its worth
If we could have the best of both worlds
A little heaven right here on Earth come on
I want the best of both worlds
And honey I know what its worth
We can have the best of both worlds
A little heaven right here on Earth yeah
Tell me is it enough
Now will it ever be enough
