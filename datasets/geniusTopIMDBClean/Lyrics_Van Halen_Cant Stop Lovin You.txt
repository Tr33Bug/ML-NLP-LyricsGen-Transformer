Theres a time and place for everything for everyone
We can push with all our might but nothings gonna come
Oh no nothings gonna change
And if I asked you not to try oh could you let it be
I wanna hold you and say
We cant throw this all away
Tell me you wont go you wont go
Do you have to hear me say
I cant stop lovin you
And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true oh
I cant stop lovin you
You can change your friends your place in life
You can change your mind
We can change the things we say
And do it anytime
Oh no but I think youll find
That when you look inside your heart
Oh baby Ill be there yeah
Hold on
Im holding on
Baby just come on come on come on
I just wanna hear you say
I cant stop lovin you
And no matter what you say or do
You know my heart is true oh
I cant stop lovin you
Oh Im so twisted and tied
And all I remember
Was how hard we tried
Only to surrender
And when its over
I know how its gonna be
And true love will never die
No not fade away
And I cant stop lovin you
And no matter what I say or do
You know my heart is true oh
I cant stop lovin you
And I know what I got to do
Hey Ray what you said is true oh
I cant stop lovin you oh
Oh I cant stop lovin you
