DOA Lyrics
We was broke and hungry on a summer day
They sent the sheriff down to try and drive us away
We was sittin ducks for the policeman
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can
And Im alone
Im on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive
Broken down and dirty dressed in rags
From the day my mama told me Boy you pack your bags
Send the mayor down in his pickup truck
The jury look at me say Outta luck
And Im alone
Im on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive
Now Im broken down and dirty dressed in rags
From the day my mama told me Boy you pack your bags
We was sittin ducks for the policeman
They found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can
And Im alone
Im on the highway
Wanted dead or alive
Dead or alive
