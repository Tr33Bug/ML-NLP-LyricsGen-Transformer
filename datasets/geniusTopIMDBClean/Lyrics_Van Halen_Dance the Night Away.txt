Have you seen her so fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes its love in the third degree
Ooh baby baby
Wont cha turn your head my way
Ooh baby baby
Come on take a chance youre old enough to
Dance the night away
Oh come on baby dance the night away
A live wire
Barely a beginner but just watch that lady go
Shes on fire
Cause dancing gets her higher than anything else she knows
Ooh baby baby
