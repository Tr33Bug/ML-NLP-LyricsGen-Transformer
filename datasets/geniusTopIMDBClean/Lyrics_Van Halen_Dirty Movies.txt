Now whos that babe with the fabulous shadow
So obscene but to me it dont matter
Her movies get down like you wont find in my hometown
Oh no  They wont believe it when they
Oh no  See what theyre seein
Go see baby now
Pictures on the silver screen
Greatest thing youve ever seen
Now her name is up in lights
Everything turns out all right
Daddys little sweetie after some damn rainbow
Got the big deal in the back of a limo
Now showbiz is so thrillin the camera rolls shes willin
They wont believe it when they see what theyre seein
Go see baby now
Hey you remember when that girl was prom queen
Oh wow

Cheering whistling  applause 
Pictures on the silver screen
Greatest thing youve ever seen
Now her name is up in lights
Everything turns out all right
Now they believe it now that theyve seen it
Go see baby now
Pictures on the silver screen
Greatest thing youve ever seen
Now her name is up in lights
Everything turns out all right
