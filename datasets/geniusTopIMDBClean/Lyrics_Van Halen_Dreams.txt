World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts falling down
Better change your tune
Yeah you reach for the golden ring
You reach for the sky
Baby just spread your wings
And get higher and higher
Straight up well climb
Well get higher and higher
Leave it all behind
Run run run away
Like a train runnin off the track
Got the truth bein left behind
Fall between the cracks
Standin on broken dreams
Never losin sight ah
Well just spread your wings
Well get higher and higher
Straight up well climb
Well get higher and higher
Leave it all behind
So baby dry your eyes
Save all the tears youve cried
Oh thats what dreams are made of
Cause we belong
In a world that must be strong
Oh thats what dreams are made of
Yeah well get higher and higher
Straight up well climb
Higher and higher
Leave it all behind
Oh well get higher and higher
Who knows what well find


So baby dry your eyes
Save all the tears youve cried
Oh thats what dreams are made of
Oh baby we belong
In a world that must be strong
Oh thats what dreams are made of
And in the end
On dreams we will depend
Cause thats what love is made of
