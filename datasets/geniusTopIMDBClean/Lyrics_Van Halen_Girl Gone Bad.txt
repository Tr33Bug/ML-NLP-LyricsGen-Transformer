Ah lazy eyes in the summer heat
Fresh from outta town
Now shes working on the street
Shakin poor boys down
Uh  girl  uh girl gone bad
Girl  girl gone bad
Found that girl with a lonesome John
But she shouldve been with me
Guess that woman fallen in love
She dont work for free
Girl gone bad yeah ah ah ah
Girl gone bad
Girl  girl gone bad
Girl  ow yeah 
Girl  oh oh oh 
Girl  yeah yeah 
Girl  say say
