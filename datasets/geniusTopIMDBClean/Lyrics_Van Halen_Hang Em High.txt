Somewhere he lost it in a turn
Now trouble seems to fit him like a glove
First come first served hes serving it back
Travels light without a pack without love
He comes from nowhere returns on his own
Late for the hanging yes hes heading for the moon
Hang em High
Leather across his thighs
Blasting out the night hes terrified to drive
One eye on the road crashed upon his head
One ear to the ground hes listening to the dead
He comes from nowhere returns on his own
Late for the hanging yes hes heading for the moon
Hang em High
Alone to himself hes laughing up his sleeve
Looking back in anger the city is relieved
Vision of Light
Child of the night
Passing by
Alone to himself hes laughing up his sleeve
Looking back in anger the city is relieved
Vision of Light
Child of the night
Passing by
Leather cross his thigh
Blasting out the night his cap hides his eyes
One eye on the road price upon his head
One ear to the ground hes listening to the dead
He comes from nowhere and he turns on his own
Late for the hangin yes hes headed for the moon
And hang em high
