Youve got me captured Im under your spell
I guess Ill never learn
I have your picture yes I know it well
Another page is turned
Are you for real Its so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me
Ill wait till your love comes down
Im coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
I wrote a letter and told her these words
That meant a lot to me
I never sent it she wouldnt have heard
Her eyes dont follow me
And while she watches I can never be free
Such good photography
Ill wait till your love comes down
Im coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
You cant imagine what your image means
The pages come alive
Your magic greets everyone who reads
Heartbreak in motor drive

Are you for real Its so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me
Ill wait till your love comes down
Im coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
Ill wait till your love comes down
Im coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are
Ill wait
