Ow
I get up and nothing gets me down
You got it tough Ive seen the toughest around
And I know baby just how you feel
You got to roll with the punches to get to whats real
Oh cant you see me standing here
I got my back against the record machine
I aint the worst that youve seen
Oh cant you see what I mean
Ah might as well jump  Jump 
Might as well jump
Go ahead and jump  Jump 
Go ahead and jump
