They may talk about you cold when you were headed for the skies
But you were young and bold and baby didnt that change with a wink of your eye
Now no ones talkin bout those crazy days gone by
No one talks about the times you cried
Ooh  Little dreamer
Ooh  Uh little dreamer
And then they went and they voted you least likely to succeed
I had to tell them baby you were armed with all youd need
Seems no ones talkin bout those crazy days gone past
Werent they amazed when you were really last
Ooh  You are the little dreamer
Oooh  You were the little dreamer
Yeah yeah
Yeah they talk about you cold when you were headed for the skies
But you were young and bold and baby didnt that change with a wink of your eye
Seems no ones talkin bout the crazy days gone past
Werent they amazed when you were really last
Ooh  You are the little dreamer
Ooh  Little dreamer yeah oh
Ooh  Yeah little dreamer
Ooh  Little dreamer
