Seorita Im in trouble again
And I cant get free  Seorita 
Youre exactly what the doctor ordered
Come on talk to me
Ah  Cant crow before Im outta the woods
But theres exceptions to the rule
Ah  Seorita do you need a friend
Im in love with you
Catch as catch catch as catch can
Anybody in their right mind could see
Its you and me
Ooh ooh
You say youre lonesome just getting by
But you turn your eyes from me
Be sure youre hurting long before you fly
Cause you got me
Catch as catch catch as catch can
Anybody in their right mind could see
You and me
Catch as catch catch as catch can
When I see you and your little guitars sing to me
I can see you dont know which way to turn
But the sun still shines  Seorita 
Dont you know that you can dance with me
Anytime
Ah  Cant crow before Im outta the woods
But theres exceptions to the rule
Ah  Seorita do you need a friend
Im in love with you
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
