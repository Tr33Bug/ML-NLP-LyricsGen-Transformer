Contact is all it takes
To change your life to lose your place in time
Contact asleep or awake
Coming around you may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever you realize
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Another world some other time
You lay your sanity on the line
Familiar faces familiar sights
Reach back remember with all your might
Ooh and there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
And simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin in
Oh sleep and dream thats all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master I become a slave
Til we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before


And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin in
Some kind of alien
Waits for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin in
Love comes walkin in 
Baby pull the string
Love comes walkin in 
Love comes walkin in yeah
Oh yeah oh
