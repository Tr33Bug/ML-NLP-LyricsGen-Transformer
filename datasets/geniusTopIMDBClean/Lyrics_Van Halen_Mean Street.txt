At night I walk this stinkin street
Past the crazies on my block
And I see the same old faces
And I hear that same old talk
And Im searching for the latest thing
A break in this routine
Im talkin some new kicks
Ones like you aint never seen
This is home
This is Mean Street
Yesah this is home
The only one I know
And we dont worry bout tomorrow
Cause were sick of these four walls
Now whatd ya think is nothing
Might be something after all
Now you know this aint no through street
The end is dead ahead
The poor folks play for keeps down here
Theyre the living dead
Come on down
Down to Mean Street
Theyre dancing now oh
Out on Mean Street
Dance baby
This hole is here and now my friend
It aint once upon a time
Its all over but the shouting
Ive come to take whats mine
Were searching for the latest thing
A break in this routine
Talkin some new kicks
Ones like you aint never seen
This is home
This is Mean Street
Yesah this is home
Only one I know
This is home  See a gun is real easy
This is Mean Street  In this desperate part of town
This is home  Turns you from hunted into hunter
This is Mean Street  Go and hunt somebody down
Wait a minute
This is home  Somebody said Fair Warning Lord
This is Mean Street  Lord strike that poor boy down
