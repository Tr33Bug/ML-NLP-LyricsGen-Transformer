Oh  Pretty Woman Lyrics
Whoo
Pretty woman walking down the street
Pretty woman the kind Id like to meet
Pretty woman I dont believe you it must be true
No one could look as good as you
Mercy
Pretty woman wont you pardon me
Pretty woman I couldnt help but see
Pretty woman oh you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me
Pretty woman stop a while
Pretty woman talk a while
Pretty woman give your smile to me
Pretty woman yeah yeah yeah
Pretty woman look my way
Pretty woman say youll stay with me
Cause I need you need you tonight
Pretty woman dont walk on by
Pretty woman dont make me cry
Pretty woman dont walk awayay okay
If thats the way it must be okay
I guess Ill go on home its late
Therell be tomorrow night but wait
What do I see
Shes walking back to me
Whoawhoa pretty woman
