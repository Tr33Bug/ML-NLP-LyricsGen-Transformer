Yeah shes gotta have soul
Or it wont feel right
Well just plain clean and simple
Wrapped up nice and tight
And home grown and down home
That makes a woman
Cookin up an old time long lost recipe for me woo
Its gettin hard to find
Guess it aint hip enough now
You take an average guy
He cant identify uh
And theres a short supply
Of the fine fine stuff
Lemme get on lemme get on lemme get on some of that
Shake it up pick it up nice ooh
Here we go here we go here we go oh yeah

Homegrown and down home

Ooh thats some real fine poundcake
Ive been out there
Tryin a little bit of everything
But its all sex without love
