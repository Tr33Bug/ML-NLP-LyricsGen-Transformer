Dont wanna wait til tomorrow
Why put it off another day
One by one little problems
Build up and stand in our way oh
One step ahead one step behind it
Now you gotta run to get even
Make future plans or dream about yesterday Hey
Come on turn turn this thing around
Right now hey
Its your tomorrow
Right now
Come on its everything
Right now
Catch that magic moment
And do it right here and now
It means everything
Miss the beat you lose the rhythm
And nothing falls into place no
Only missed by a fraction
Slipped a little off your pace oh
The more things you get the more you want
Just trading one for the other
Workin so hard to make it easy woah got to turn
Come on turn this thing around
