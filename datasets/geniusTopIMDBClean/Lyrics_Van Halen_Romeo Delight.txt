I told her never in hell no special reason
Must a lied cause I aint leavin
Were in for a very long night
Heard a vicious rumor from your mamas tongue
You a desprate woman
Need a man with a gun
High crime zone in the city of lights
Baby please
Cant take it anymore
Baby please
Cant take it anymore
Im takin whiskey to the party tonight
And Im lookin for somebody to squeeze
I aint lookin for somebody to fight
Baby dont get uptight
Baby please
Wanna see my ID Try to clip my wings
Dont have to show you proof of anything
I know the law friend
At the leventh hour Im goin back outside
Give it a try
Im your last loose end
Baby please
Cant take it anymore
Baby please
Cant take it anymore
Im takin whiskey to the party tonight
And Im lookin for somebody to squeeze
I aint lookin for somebody to fight
Baby dont get uptight
Baby please
I feel my heart beat feel my heart beat feel my heart beat oh yeah
Baby please
Cant take it anymore
Baby please
Cant take it anymore

Im takin whiskey to the party tonight
And Im lookin for somebody to squeeze
I aint lookin for somebody to fight
Baby dont get uptight
Baby please
