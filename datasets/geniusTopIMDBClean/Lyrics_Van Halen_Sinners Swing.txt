Alright you sinners swing
Danger in the rearview mirror theres trouble in the wind
Badness bringin up the rear the menace is loose again
She looks so fuckin good so sexy and so frail
Something got the bite on me Im goin straight to hell
And now were wastin time
Now were wastin time
Same old pickup lines
Same old pickup lines
And you keep tryin
Dont waste time
Uh come back to your senses baby we can come to terms
I can almost ttaste it it burns
Youd be sittin pretty but you try to take the fifth
Wearin out my welcome guess I better save my breath
And now were wastin time
Now were wastin time
Same old pickup lines
Same old pickup lines
And you keep tryin
But you keep tryin
Dont waste time
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Soon youll see my silhouette adarkenin your door
I can almost ttaste it I want more
No ones above suspicion no ones got it wired
I may burn my fingers want my iron in that fire
And now were wastin time
Now were wastin time
Same old pickup lines
Same old pickup lines
And you keep tryin
But you keep tryin
Dont waste time
Get get get get get out and push
Babe get back get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get back get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Get get get get get out and push
Ah babe
Get get get get get out and push
Alright you sinners swing
