Oh yeah
Check me out on the good side here
Well my babys on the corner and shes lookin so fine
Put one and one together and it blowed my mind
A man needs love to live Im the living proof
Catch that smile and I hit the roof
Big double take but you keep on walking
Im in love
Once over Im overdone
So this is love
Ooh I need your lovin
Come on baby take me home
So this is love
Ooh I need your lovin
Im just skin and bones
Goin out my way know my way around
The grass is never greener and theres plenty around
All the other girls they be put to shame
Over the edge and here Ill stay
Got me on pins and needles
And she knows
Shes mine and aint lettin go
So this is love
Ooh I need your love
Baby take me home
So this is love
Ooh I need your lovin

Got me on pins and needles
Yes she knows
Shes mine and aint lettin go
So this is love
Ooh I need your love
So this is love
Ooh I need your love
Baby got to have your love
Ooh I Ooh I need got to have that love
Baby baby still love
So this is love
So this is love
