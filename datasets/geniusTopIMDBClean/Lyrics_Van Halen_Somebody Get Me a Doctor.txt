You better call me a doctor feelin no pain
Overloaded down the drain
Somebody get me a doctor
You better call up the ambulance Im deep in shock
Overloaded baby I can hardly walk
Somebody get me a doctor
Somebody get me a doctor
Feelin over fine
And Im speedin down that line
You better call up a doctor feelin high
Im overloaded baby I say Byebye
Somebody get me a doctor
Somebody get me a doctor
Somebody get me a doctor
Somebody get me a shot
