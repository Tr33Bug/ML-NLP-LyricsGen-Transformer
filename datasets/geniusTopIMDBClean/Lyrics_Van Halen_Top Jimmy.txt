Some friends of mine just the other night
Went to hear this cool cat blow
The say he sang so good that the roof fell in and they didnt even stop the show
They dont remember the place but they remember the face and now everybody wanna go
Top Jimmy cooks Top Jimmy swings
Hes got the look oooh
Top Jimmy hes the king
Jimmy on the television famous people laughing with him
Jimmy on the news at five
Jimmy on the radio and even on the video that baddest cat alive
Driving all the women crazy only want Jimmybaby
Love it when he rolls his eyes
Whoo shake it baby
Jukejoint Jimmy is the latest thing hes got the sound that everybody digs
And the joint been jumpin when the band been pumpin and you know theyre playing crazy gigs
Well you aint been living till youve seen the living end
Top Jimmy and his Rhythm Pigs
Oh Jimmy
