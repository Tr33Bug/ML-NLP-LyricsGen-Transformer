I know that you believe in me
Thats all I ever need uhhuh
No no nothings gonna stop me
Nothing will be scaring me oh no
Hey baby
Yeah its the only way out
Oh little darling
Now come on whats it all about
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got
Oh I know it wont hurt
I got to have a little taste
I just wanna sink my teeth in that fine piece of real estate yeah
Hey baby
Woo make it nice and sweet
Oh little darling
Lets take a walk down easy street
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Lets give it all we got
Baby got a feeling
Oh I wanna touch it now
See the whole wide world turn upside down
Hey baby woo
Someday well be
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Til we got stung
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got
Standing on top  Hey baby
Standing on top  Hey darling woo
Standing on top
Standing on top
Standing on top
