All right
Ha ha haha
You said
I cannot get there from here baby
And I dont care where Im goin
Heres to your thin red line
Im stepping over
Thought youd never miss me
Til I got a Fat City address
Nonstop talker what a rocker
Blueeyed murder in a size five dress
Change nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah you hit the ground running
Change aint nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah you hit the ground running
No I dont ask for permission
This is my chance to fly
Maybe enough aint enough for you
But its my turn at a try
Thought youd never miss me
Til I got a Fat City address
Nonstop talker what a rocker
Blueeyed murder in a size five dress
Change nothing stays the same
Unchained and ya hit the ground running
Change aint nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running
Change nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running
Change aint nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running
Whoo hooo Take a look at this
Hey man that suit is you Whooeee
Youll get some leg tonight for sure
Tell us how you do Woo hoo hoo hoo
Come on Dave give me a break 
Hey hey hey hey one break coming up
Change aint nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running
Change aint nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running
Change aint nothing stays the same
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running
Change aint nothing stays the same
Unchained
