Everybodys looking for something
Something to fill in the holes
We think a lot but dont talk much about it
Til things get out of control oh
How do I know when its love
I cant tell you but it lasts forever
Oh how does it feel when its love
Its just something you feel together
When its love
You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessing
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson
How do I know when its love
I cant tell you but it lasts forever
Oh how does it feel when its love
Its just something you feel together
Ohoh ohoh  Oh when its love
Ohoh ohoh  You can feel it yeah

How do I know when its love
I cant tell you but it lasts forever
Ooh how does it feel when its love
