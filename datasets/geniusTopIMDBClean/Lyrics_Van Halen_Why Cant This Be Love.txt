Oh here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey I dont know
Oh tell me where to begin
Cause I never ever
Felt so much
Hey
And I cant recall
Any love at all
Oh baby this blows em all away
Its got what it takes
So tell me why cant this be love
Straight from my heart
Oh tell me why cant this be love
I tell myself
Hey only fools rush in
Only time will tell if we stand the test of time
All I know
Youve got to run to win
And Ill be damned if Ill get
Hung up on the line hey
No I cant recall
Anything at all
Ah baby this blows em all away
Woo


Its got what it takes
So tell me why cant this be love
You want it straight from the heart
Oh tell me why cant this be love
Woo its got what it takes
So tell me why cant this be love
Straight from the heart
Tell me why cant this be love
Baby why cant this be love
Got to know why cant this be love
I wanna know why cant this be love
