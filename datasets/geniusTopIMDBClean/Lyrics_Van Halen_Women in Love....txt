Women in Love Lyrics
My heart youre breakin my heart
Girl you better start
Thinkin somethin real
Seems like lovin you is just a crazy dream
But do as you feel
All these crazy women
One more crazy night
But one nights all were given
So baby leave me alone
Or baby stay the night
Oh women in love 
Oh baby make up your mind
Make up your mind 
I know youre in love
Oh women in love 
So baby make up your mind
Women in love 
Scream go on and scream
That your love is all youre knowin
But honey if youre needin a woman
Just as bad as me you oughta be goin
All these crazy women
One more crazy night
But one nights all were given
So honey leave me alone
Or baby youre stayin the night
All these crazy women
Ah just one more crazy night
But one nights all were given
So honey leave me alone
Or lady youre stayin the night
Oh women in love 
Baby make up your mind
Make up your mind 
And I know youre in love
Oh women in love 
Ooh babe I know youre in love
Women in love
