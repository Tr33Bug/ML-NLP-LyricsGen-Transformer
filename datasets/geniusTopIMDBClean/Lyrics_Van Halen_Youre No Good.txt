Well Im feelin better now that were through
Feelin better baby Im over you
I learned my lesson baby and it left a scar
But now I see how you really are
Youre no good no good
Baby youre no good
No good no good no good
Baby youre no good
I broke a heart simple and true
Broke a heart for someone like you
Well be coming back dont come running to me
I wanna love you maybe set you free
Youre no good no good no good
Baby youre no good
Youre no good no good no good
Baby youre no good
Used to be I couldnt sleep at night baby
Now you go on do what you want to
