Half a mile from the county fair
And the rain came pourin down
Me and Billy standin there
With a silver half a crown
Hands are full of a fishin rod
And the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin wet
With our backs against the fence
Oh the water
Oh the water
Oh the water
Hope it dont rain all day
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin home
And it stoned me
And the rain let up
And the sun came up
And we were gettin dry
Almost let a pickup truck
Nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in
And the driver grinned
And he dropped us up the road
And we looked at the swim
And we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles
Oh the water
Oh the water
Oh the water
Let it run all over me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin home
And it stoned me
On the way back home
We sang a song
But our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man
From across the road
With the sunshine in his eyes
Well he lived all alone
In his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too
One for me and you
And he said Hey There you are
Oh the water
Oh the water
Oh the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin home
And it stoned me
Well it stoned me to my soul
Stoned on me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
Well it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like goin home
And it stoned me
