And well walk down the avenue again
And well sing all the songs from way back when
And well walk down the avenue again and the healing has begun
And well walk down the avenue in style
And well walk down the avenue and well smile
And well say baby aint it all worthwhile
When the healing has begun
I want you to put on your pretty summer dress
You can wear your Easter bonnet and all the rest
And I wanna make love to you yes yes yes
When the healing has begun
When you hear the music ringin in your soul
And you feel it in your heart and it grows and grows
And it comes from the backstreet rock  roll and the healing has begun
That is where It comes from
I want you to put on your pretty summer dress
You can wear your Easter bonnet and all the rest
And I wanna make love to you yes yes yes
And the healing has begun
Were gonna make music underneath the stars
Were gonna play to the violin and the two guitars
Were gonna sit there and play for hours and hours when the healing has begun
Spoken 
Wait a minute listen listen
I didnt know you stayed up so late
I just got home from a gig and I saw
You standing on the street
Just let me move on up to this windowsill a lot yeah
I got some sherry
You want a drop of port
Lets move behind this door here
Lets move on up behind this letterbox behind this door
Lets go in your front room
Lets play this Muddy Waters record you got there
If you just open up a little bit
And let me ease on in this backstreet jellyroll
Were gonna stay out all night long
And then were gonna go out and roam across the field
Baby you know how I feel when the healing has begun
When the healing when the healing
Were gonna stay out all night long
Were gonna dance to the rock  roll
When the healing when the healing has begun
Baby just let me ease on a little bit dig this backstreet jellyroll
