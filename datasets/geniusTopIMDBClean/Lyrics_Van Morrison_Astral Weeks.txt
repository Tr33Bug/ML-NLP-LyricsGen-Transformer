If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me
Would you kissa my eyes
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
From the far side of the ocean
If I put the wheels in motion
And I stand with my arms behind me
And Im pushin on the door
Could you find me
Would you kissa my eyes
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
There you go
Standin with the look of avarice
Talkin to Huddie Ledbetter
Showin pictures on the wall
Whisperin in the hall
And pointin a finger at me
There you go there you go
Standin in the sun darlin
With your arms behind you
And your eyes before
There you go
Takin good care of your boy
Seein that hes got clean clothes
Puttin on his little red shoes
I see you know hes got clean clothes
Aputtin on his little red shoes
Apointin a finger at me
And here I am
Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best
Lookin straight at you
Comin through darlin
Yeah yeah yeah
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me
Would you kissa my eyes
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
To be born again
To be born again
In another world darling
In another world
In another time
Got a home on high
Aint nothing but a stranger in this world
Im nothing but a stranger in this world
I got a home on high
In another land
So far away
So far away
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven oooh uuuh
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place uhuhuhuh
Way up in the heaven mhmhmh
In another time haha mh
In another place
In another time
In another place
In another face
