Spread your wings come on fly awhile
Straight to my arms little angel child
You know you only
Lonely twentytwo story block
And if somebody not just anybody
Wanted to get close to you
For instance me baby
All you gotta do is ring a bell
Step right up step right up
And step right up ballerina
Crowd will catch you
Fly it sigh it try it
Well I may be wrong
But something deep in my heart
Tells me Im right and I dont think so
You know I saw the writing on the wall
When you came up to me
Child you were heading for a fall
But if it gets to you
And you feel like you just cant go on
All you gotta do is ring a bell
And step right up and step right up
And step right up just like a ballerina
Steppin lightly
Alright well its getting late
Yes it is yes it is
And this time I forget to slip into your slumber
The light is on the left side of your head
And Im standing in your doorway
And Im mumbling and I cant remember
The last thing that ran through my head
Here come the man here come the man and he say
He say the show must go on
So all you gotta do is ring the bell
And step right up and step right up
And step right up
