Little Jimmys gone
Away out of the back street out of the window
To the falling rain
Right on time
Right on time
Thats why Broken Arrow
Waved his finger down the road so dark and narrow in the evening
Just before the Sunday sixbell chime
Six bells chime
And all the dogs are barking
Way on down the diamondstudded highway where you wander
And you roam from your retreating view
And way over on the railroad
Tomorrow while the tipping trucks roll out all together
Every scrapbook stuck with glue
And Ill stand beside you
Beside you
Oh child
To never never never wonder why at all
No no no no no no no no
To never never wonder why at all
To never never never wonder why
Its gotta be it has to be
Way across the country where the hillside mountains glide
The dynamo of your smile caressed the barefoot virgin child to wander
Past your window with the lantern lit
You held it in the doorway and you cast against the pointed island breeze
Said your time was open go away along your merry way
Past the brazen footlits of the silence easy
You breathe in you breathe out
You breathe in you breathe out
You breathe in you breathe out
You breathe in you breathe out
And youre high on your highflying cloud
Wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you
This time its found you
You turn around
You turn around
You turn around
You turn around
And Im beside you
Beside you

Oh darling
To never never wonder why at all
No no no no no
To never never never wonder why at all
To never never never wonder why its got to be
It has to be
And Im beside you
Beside you
Oh child
To never never wonder why at all
Im beside you
Beside you
Beside you
Beside you
Ooooh oooh
Child
