From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Well be lovers once again
On the bright side of the road
Little darlin come with me
Wont you help me share my load
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Into this life were born
Baby sometimes sometimes we dont know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Lets enjoy it while we can
Lets enjoy it while we can 
Wont you help me share my load  help me share my load 
From the dark end of the street
To the bright side of the road
Into this life were born
Baby sometimes baby sometimes we dont know why
And time seems to go by so fast
In the twinkling of an eye
Lets enjoy it while we can
Lets enjoy it while we can 
Wont you help me sing my song  help me sing my song 
Little darling come along
To the bright side of the road
On the dark end of the street  on the dark end of the street 
To the bright side of the road  to the bright side of the road
