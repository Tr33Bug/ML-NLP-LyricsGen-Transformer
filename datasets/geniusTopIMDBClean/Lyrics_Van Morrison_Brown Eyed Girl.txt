Hey where did we go
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin a new game
Laughing and a running hey hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin and you
My browneyed girl
You my browneyed girl
Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbows wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall with you
My browneyed girl
You my browneyed girl
Do you remember when we used to sing
Shalalalalalalalalalalateda
Just like that
Shalalalalalalalalalalatedalateda
So hard to find my way
Now that Im all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My how you have grown
Cast my memory back there Lord
Sometimes Im overcome thinking bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My browneyed girl
You my browneyed girl


Do you remember when we used to sing
Shalalalalalalalalalalateda 
Lyin on the green grass
Shalalalalalalalalalalatedalateda 
Bit by bit by bit by bit by bit by bit
Shalalalalalalalalalalatedalateda
