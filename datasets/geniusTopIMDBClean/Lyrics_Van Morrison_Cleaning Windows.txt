Oh the smell of the bakery from across the street
Got in my nose
As we carried our ladders down the street
With the wroughtiron gate rows
I went home and listened to Jimmie Rodgers
In my lunchbreak
Bought five Woodbines at the shop on the corner
And went straight back to work
Oh Sam was up on top
And I was on the bottom with the V
We went for lemonade and Paris buns
At the shop and broke for tea
I collected from the lady and I cleaned the fanlight
Insideout
I was blowing saxophone on the weekend
In that down joint
Whats my line
Im happy cleaning windows
Take my time
Ill see you when my love grows
Baby dont let it slide
Im a working man in my prime
Cleanin windows
number thirtysix 
I heard Leadbelly and Blind Lemon
On the street where I was born yeah
Sonny Terry Brownie McGhee and Muddy Waters singin
Im A Rolling Stone
I went home
And read my Christmas Humphreys book on Zen
Curiosity killed the cat
Kerouacs Dharma Bums and On The Road
Whats my line
Im happy cleaning windows hey
Take my time
Ill see you when my love grows
Baby dont let it slide
Im a working man in my prime
Cleanin windows
Say again
Whats my line
Im happy cleaning windows
Well I take my time
Ill see you when my love grows
Dont let it slide
Im a working man in my prime
Cleanin windows
Alright cleanin

Alright well be right tomorrow
