I can hear her heart beat from a thousand miles
And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her thats where I belong
Yet I run into her like a rivers song
She give me love love love love crazy love
She give me love love love love crazy love
Shes got a fine sense of humour when Im feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble take away my grief
Take away my heartache in the night like a thief
She give me love love love love crazy love
She give me love love love love crazy love
And I need her in the daytime
I need her 
And I need her in the night
I need her 
And I want to throw my arms around her
I need her 
And kiss and hug her kiss and hug her tight
Yet when Im returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin brighten up my day
Yet it make me righteous yet it make me whole
Yet it make me mellow down into my soul
She give me love love love love crazy love
She give me love love love love crazy love
She give me love love love love crazy love
She give me love love love love crazy love
