We get it almost every night
And when that moon gets big and bright
Its supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Everybody here is out of sight
They dont bark and they dont bite
They keep things loose they keep things light
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Everybodys feelin warm and bright
Its such a fine and natural sight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight
We like our fun and we never fight
You cant dance and stay uptight
Its supernatural delight
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the moonlight
Everybodys feelin warm and bright
Its such a fine and natural sight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight
Everybody here is out of sight
They dont bark and they dont bite
They keep things loose they keep things light
Everybody was dancing in the moonlight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight
Everybodys feelin warm and bright
Its such a fine and natural sight
Everybodys dancing in the moonlight
Repeat to fade
