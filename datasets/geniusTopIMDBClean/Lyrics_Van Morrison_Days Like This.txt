When its not always raining
Therell be days like this
When theres no one complaining
Therell be days like this
Everything falls into place
Like the flick of a switch
Well my mama told me
Therell be days like this
When you dont need to worry
Therell be days like this
When no ones in a hurry
Therell be days like this
When you dont get betrayed
By that old Judas kiss
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
When you dont need an answer
Therell be days like this
When you dont meet a chancer
Therell be days like this
When all the parts of the puzzle
Start to look like they fit
Then I must remember
Therell be days like this
When everyone is up front
And theyre not playing tricks
When you dont have no freeloaders
Out to get their kicks
When its nobodys business
The way that you want to live
I just have to remember
Therell be days like this
When no one steps on my dreams
Therell be days like this
When people understand what I mean
Therell be days like this
When you ring out the changes
Of how everything is
Well my mama told me
Therell be days like this
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
Oh my mama told me
Therell be days like this
