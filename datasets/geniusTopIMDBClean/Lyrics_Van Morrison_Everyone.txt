We shall walk again down along the lane
Down the avenue just like we used to do
With our heads so high smile at passers by
Then well softly sigh ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Everyone everyone everyone everyone
Everyone everyone everyone everyone
By the winding stream we shall lay and dream
Well make dreams come true if we want them to
Yes all will come play the pipes and drum
Sing a happy song and well sing along
Everyone everyone everyone everyone
Everyone everyone everyone everyone
We shall walk again all along down the lane
Down the avenue just like we used to do
With our heads so high smile at passers by
Then well softly sigh ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Everyone everyone everyone everyone
Everyone everyone everyone everyone
