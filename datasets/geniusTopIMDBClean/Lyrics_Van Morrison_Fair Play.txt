Fair play to you Killarneys lakes are so blue
And the architecture Im taking in with my mind so fine
Tell me of Poe Oscar Wilde and Thoreau
Let your midnight and your daytime turn into love of life
Its a very fine line
But youve got the mind child to carry on
When its just about to be carried on
And theres only one meadows way to go
And you say Geronimo
Theres only one meadows way to go
And you say Geronimo
A paperback book as we walk down the street
Fill my mind with tales of mystery mystery and imagination
Forever fair and Im touching your hair
I wish we could be dreamers in this dream oh let it dream
And theres only one meadows way to go
And you say Geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And you say Geronimo
Fair play to you Killarneys lakes are so blue
Highho silver tit for tat and I love you for that
Highho silver tit for tat and I love you for that
Love you for that love you for that
Highho silver tit for tat tit for tat and I love you for that
Highho silver tit for tat
Yeah yeah and I love you for that
And theres only one meadows way to go
And I and I say Geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And we say Geronimo Geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And we say Geronimo
And theres only one meadows way to go
And we say Geronimo
Fair play to you
