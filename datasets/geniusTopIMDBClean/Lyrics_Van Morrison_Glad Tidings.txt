And theyll lay you down low and easy
And the lips that you kiss will say Christmas
And the miles that you traveled the distance
So believe no lies
Dry your eyes and realize
That surprise
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
And the business will shake hands and talk in numbers
And the princess will wake up from her slumber
Then all the knights will step forth with their arm bands
And every stranger you meet in the street will make demands
So believe no lies
Then dry your eyes and realize
That surprise
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
And well send you glad tidings from New York
Open up your eyes so you may see
Ask you not to read between the lines
Hope that you will come right in on time oh
And theyll talk to you while youre in trances
And youll visualize not taking any chances
But meet them halfway with love peace and persuasion
And expect them to rise for the occasion
Dont it gratify when you see it materialize
Right in front of your eyes by surprise
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Mmm mmm


And well send you glad tidings from New York
Open up your eyes so you may see
Ask you not to read between the lines
Hope that you will come right in on time woah
And theyll lay you down low and easy
