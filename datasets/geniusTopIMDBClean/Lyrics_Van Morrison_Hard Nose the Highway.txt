Hey kids dig the first takes
Aint that some interpretation
When Sinatra sings against Nelson Riddle strings
Then takes a vacation
Seen some hard times
Drawn some bad lines
No time for shoeshines
Hard nose the highway
I was tore down at the deads place
A shaved head at the organ
But that wasnt half as bad as it was oh no
Belfast and Boston
Seen some hard times
Drawn some bad lines
No time for shoeshines
Hard nose the highway
Put your money where your mouth is
Then we can get something going
In order to win you must be prepared to lose sometime
And leave one or two cards showing
Seen some hard times
Drawn some bad lines
No time for shoeshines
Hard nose the highway
