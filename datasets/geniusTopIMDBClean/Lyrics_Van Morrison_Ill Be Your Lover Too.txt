Ill be your man
Ill understand
Do my best to take good care of you
Yes I will
Youll be my queen
Ill be your king
And Ill be your lover too
Yes I will
Derry down green
Color of my dream
A dream thats daily
Coming true
Ill tell you
When day is through
I will come to you
And tell you of your many charms
And youll look at me
With eyes that see
And melt into
Each others arms
And so I come
To be the one
Whos always standing
Next to you
Reach out for me
So I can be alright
The one whos always reaching out for you
Yes I will yes I will
Youll be my queen
Ill be your king
And Ill be your lover too
