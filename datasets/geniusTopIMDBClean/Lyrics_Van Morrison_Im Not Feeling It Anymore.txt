Have to get back have to get back the base
I need to talk to somebody I can trust
Too many cooks are tryin to spoil the broth
I cant feel it in my throat thats all she wrote
Im not feeling it no more
Im not feeling it anymore
Not feelin it no more
Not feelin it anymore
When I was high at the party everything looked good
I was seein through rosecoloured glasses
Not seein the wood for the trees
I started out in normal operation
But I just ended up in doubt
All my drinking buddies they locked me out
Im not feelin it no more
Im not feelin it anymore
No feelin it no more
Im tryin to give you the score
You see me up there baby Im on the screen
But I know better now its so unreal
If this is success then somethings awful wrong
Cause I bought the dream and I had to play along
Im not feelin it no more
Im not feelin it anymore
Im tryin to give you the score
Im not feelin it no more


We all know that money dont buy you love
You just get a job and somewhere to live
You have to look for happiness within yourself
And dont go chasin thinkin that it is somewhere else
Im not feelin it no more
Im not feelin it anymore
Baby Im tryin to give you the score
Im not feelin it no more
I was pretendin all the time
I was givin everybody what they wanted
And I lost my peace of mind
And all I ever wanted was simply just to be me
All you ever need is the truth
And the truth will set you free yeah
Im not feelin it no more
Im not feelin it anymore
Im tryin to give you the score
Just like I did before
Im not feelin it no more
Im not feelin it anymore
Im not feelin it no more
Baby Im just trying to give you the score
Im not feelin it anymore 
Im not feelin it no more
Not feelin it anymore
Not feelin it no more
Not feelin it no more baby
Not feelin it anymore
