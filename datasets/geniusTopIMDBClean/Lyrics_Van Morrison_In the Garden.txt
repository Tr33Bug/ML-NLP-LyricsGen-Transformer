The fields are always wet with rain
After a summer shower when I saw you standin
Standin in the garden
In the garden wet with rain
You wiped the teardrops from your eye in sorrow
As we watched the petals fall down to the ground
And as I sat beside you I felt the
Great sadness that day in the garden
And then one day you came back home
You were a creature all in rapture
You had your key to your soul
And you did open that day you came back to the garden
The olden summer breeze was blowin against your face
Alright 
The light of the Lords shinin on your countenance divine
And you were a violet colour as you
Sat beside your father and your mother in the garden
The summer breeze was blowin on your face
Within your violet you treasure your summery words
And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine
Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden
And you went into a trance
Your childlike vision became so fine
And we heard lil bells within the church
We loved so much
And felt the presence of the youth of
Eternal summers in the garden
Alright 
And as it touched your cheeks so lightly
Born again you were and blushed
And we touched each other lightly
And we felt the presence of the Christ
Within our hearts in the garden
And I turned to you and I said
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father in the garden
Listen
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
In the garden wet with rain
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost
In the garden
In the garden wet with rain
Yeah alright
No guru no method no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father in the garden
