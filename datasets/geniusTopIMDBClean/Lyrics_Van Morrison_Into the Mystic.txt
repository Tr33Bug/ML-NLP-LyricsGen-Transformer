We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won
As we sailed into the mystic
Hark now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly
Into the mystic
And when that foghorn blows
I will be coming home mmhmm hmm
And when the foghorn blows
I want to hear it
I dont have to fear it
And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will float
Into the mystic mmm
When that foghorn blows
You know I will be coming home mmm uh
And when that foghorn whistle blows
I gotta hear it
I dont have to fear it
And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will float
Into the mystic mmm
Come on girl
Too late to stop now
