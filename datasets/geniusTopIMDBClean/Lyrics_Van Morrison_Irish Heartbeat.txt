Oh wont you stay
Stay a while with your own ones
Dont ever stray
Stray so far from your own ones
Cause the world is so cold
Dont care nothing for your soul
That you share with your own ones
Dont rush away
Rush away from your own ones
Just one more day
One more day with your own ones
And the world is so cold
Dont care nothing bout your soul
That you share with your own ones
Theres a stranger and hes standing at your door
Might be your best friend might be your brother
You may never know
Im going back
Going back to my own ones
Im back to talk
Talk awhile with my own ones
Cause the world is so cold
Dont care nothing bout your soul
You share with your own ones
Oh wont you stay
One more day with your own ones
Dont rush away
Rush away from your own ones
This old world is so cold
Dont care nothing for your soul
You share with your own ones
