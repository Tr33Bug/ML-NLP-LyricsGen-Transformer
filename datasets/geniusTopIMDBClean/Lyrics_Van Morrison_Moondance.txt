Well its a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous  night to make romance
Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And Im trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low
You know the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you my love
Can I just make some more romance with you my love
Well I want to make love to you tonight
I cant wait til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that youre never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true dear
There and then I will make you my own
And every time I touch you you just tremble inside
Then I know how much you want me that you cant hide
Can I just have one more moondance with you my love
Can I just make some more romance with you my love
Well its a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And Im trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low
You know the nights magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you my love
Can I just make some more romance with you my love
One more moondance with you
In the moonlight
On a magic night
La la la la
In the moonlight
On a magic night
Cant I just have one more moondance with you my love
