No more lockdown
No more government overreach
No more fascist police
Disturbing our peace
No more taking of our freedom
And our Godgiven rights
Pretending its for our safety
When its really to enslave
Whos running our country
Whos running our world
Examine it closely
And watch it unfurl
No more lockdown
No more threats
No more Imperial College
Scientists making up crooked facts
No more lockdown
No more pulling the wool over our eyes
No more celebrities telling us
Telling us what wre supposed to feel
No more status quo
Put your shouldr to the wind
No more lockdown
No more lockdown
No more lockdown
No more lockdown
No more lockdown
No more government overreach
No more fascist police
Disturbing our peace
No more taking our freedom
And our Godgiven rights
Pretending its for our safety
When its really to enslave
Whos running our country
Whos running our world
Examine it closely
And watch it unfurl
No more lockdown
No more threats
No more Imperial College scientists
Making up crooked facts
No more lockdown
No more pulling the wool over our eyes
No more celebrities telling us
How were supposed to feel
No more status quo
Gotta put your shoulder to the wind
