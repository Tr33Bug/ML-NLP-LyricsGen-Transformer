Out on the highways and the byways all alone
Im still searching for searching for my home
Up in the morning up in the morning out on the road
And my head is aching and my hands are cold
And Im looking for the silver lining silver lining in the clouds
And Im searching for
And Im searching for the philosophers stone
And its a hard road its a hard road daddyo
When my job is turning lead into gold
He was born in the back street born in the back street jelly roll
Im on the road again and Im searching for
The philosophers stone
Can you hear that engine
Oh can you hear that engine drone
Well Im on the road again and Im searching for
Searching for the philosophers stone
Up in the morning up in the morning
When the streets are white with snow
Its a hard road its a hard road daddyo
Up in the morning up in the morning
Out on the job
Well youve got me searching for
Searching for the philosophers stone
Even my best friends even my best friends they dont know
That my job is turning lead into gold
When you hear that engine when you hear that engine drone
Im on the road again and Im searching for the philosophers stone
Its a hard road even my best friends they dont know
And Im searching for searching for the philosophers stone
