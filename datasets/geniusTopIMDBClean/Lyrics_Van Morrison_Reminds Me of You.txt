I miss you so much I cant stand it
Seems like my heart is breaking in two
My head says no but my soul demands it
Everything I do reminds me of you
I miss you so much in this house full of shadows
While the rain keeps pouring down my window too
When will the pain recede to the darkness
From whence it has come and Im feeling so blue
Aint goin down no more to the well
Sometimes it feels like Im going to hell
Sometimes Im knocking on your front door
But I dont have nothing to sell no more
Seems like the spirit is pushing me onwards
Im able to see where I tripped and went wrong
Ill just have to guess where my soul will find comfort
And I miss you so much when Im singing my song
Aint goin down no more to the well
And sometimes it seems Im going to hell
Youll find me knocking on your front door
But I dont have nothing to sell no more
Seems like my spirit is pushing me onwards
Til Im able to see where I tripped when I went wrong
Ill just have to guess where my soul will get comfort
I miss you so much when Im singing my song
I miss you so much I cant stand it
Seems like my heart is breaking in two
My head says no but my soul demands it
And everything I do reminds me of you
Everything I do reminds me of you
Everything I do reminds me of you
Songwriter  Van Morrison
