Chamois cleaning all the windows
Singing songs about Edith Piafs soul
And I hear blue strains of no regredior
Across the street from Cathedral Notre Dame
Meanwhile back in San Francisco
Were trying hard to make this whole thing blend
As we sit upon this jagged
Storey block with you my friend
And its a long way to Buffalo
Its a long way to Belfast city too
And Im hoping the joist wont blow the hoist
cos this time they bit off more than they can chew
As we gaze out on as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on as we gaze out on

All the orange boxes are scattered
Against the Safeways supermarket in the rain
And everybody feels so determined
Not to feel anyone elses pain
You know that  No ones making no commitments
To anybody but themselves
Hidin behind closed doorways
Tryin to get outside outside of empty shells
And for every crosscuttin country corner
For every Hank Williams railroad train that cried
And all the chains badges flags and emblems
And every strain on every brain and every eye   
As we gaze out on as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on as we gaze out on

And the restaurant tables are completely covered
The record company has paid out for the wine
You got everything in the world you ever wanted
Right about now your face should wear a smile
Thats the way it all should happen
When youre in when youre in the state youre in
Youve got your pen and notebook ready
I think its about time time for us to begin
And were over in a 52nd Street apartment
Socializing with the white hope few
Just to be hip and get wet with the jet set
But theyre flying too high to see my point of view
As we gaze out on as we gaze out on
As we gaze out on as we gaze out on

See them freedom marching
Out on the street freedom marching
