Slim slow slider
Horse you ride white as snow
Slim slow slider
Horse you ride is white as snow
Tell it everywhere you go
Saw you walking
Down by the Ladbroke Grove this morning
Saw you walking
Down by the Ladbroke Grove this morning
Catching pebbles for some sandy beach
Youre out of reach
Saw you early this morning
With your brand new boy and your Cadillac
Saw you early this morning
With your brand new boy and your Cadillac
Youre gone for something
And I know you wont be back
I know youre dying baby
And I know you know it too
I know youre dying
And I know you know it too
Every time I see you
I just dont know what to do
