Ive been searchin a long time
For someone exactly like you
Ive been travelling all around the world
Waiting for you to come through
Someone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
Ive been travellin a hard road
Baby lookin for someone exactly like you
Ive been carrying my heavy load
Waitin for the light to come shining through
Someone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
Ive been doing some soul searching
Find out where youre at
Ive been up and down the highway
And all kinds of foreign lands
Someone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
Ive been all around the world
Marching to the beat of a different drum
But just lately Ive realized
Baby the best is yet to come

Someone like you
Will make it all worthwhile
Someone like you
Keep me satisfied
Someone exactly like you
The best is yet to come
