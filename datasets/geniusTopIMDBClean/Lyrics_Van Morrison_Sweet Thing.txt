And I will stroll the merry way and jump the hedges first
And I will drink the clear clean water for to quench my thirst
And I shall watch the ferryboats and theyll get high
On a bluer ocean against tomorrows sky
And I will never grow so old again
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
Ohuhohoh sweet thing this sweet thing
Ehehyo sweet thing
Yeahyeah my my my my my sweet thing
And I shall drive my chariot down your streets and cry
Hey its me Im dynamite and I dont know why
And you shall take me strongly in your arms again
And I will not remember that I ever felt the pain
We shall walk and talk in gardens all misty wet
All misty wet with rain down
And I will never never never grow so old again
Ohuhoh you sweet thing
Ohuhoh oh you sweet thing sweet thing
My my my my my
And I will raise my hand up into the night time sky
And count the stars thats shining in your eye
And just to dig it all an not to wonder thats just fine
And Ill be satisfied not to read in between the lines
And I will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain
And I will never ever ever ever grow so old again
Ohuhoh sweet thing
Ohuhohuhoh sugar baby
Ohuhoh sweet thing
Sugar baby sugar baby sugar baby
With your champagne eyes
And your saintlike smile
