TB Sheets Lyrics
Now listen Julie baby
It aint natural for you to cry in the midnight
Aint natural for you to cry way into midnight through
Until the wee small hours long fore the break of dawn
Oh Lord
Now Julie an there aint nothin on my mind
More further way than what youre lookin for
I see the way you jumped at me Lord from behind the door
And looked into my eyes
Your little star struck innuendos
Inadequacies an foreign bodies
And the sunlight shining through the crack in the window pane
Numbs my brain
And the sunlight shining through the crack in the window pane
Numbs my brain oh Lord
So open up the window and let me breathe
I said open up the window and let me breathe
Im looking down to the street below Lord I cried for you
I cried I cried for you oh Lord
The cool room Lord is a fools room
The cool room Lord is a fools room
And I can almost smell your TB sheets
And I can almost smell your TB sheets
On your sick bed
I gotta go I gotta go
And you said Please stay I wanna I wanna
I wanna drink of water I wanna drink of water
Go in the kitchen get me a drink of water
I said I gotta go I gotta go baby
I said Ill send Ill send somebody around later
You know we got John comin around here later
With a bottle of wine for you baby but I gotta go
The cool room Lord is a fools room
The cool room Lord Lord is a fools room a fools room
And I can almost smell your TB sheets
I can almost smell your TB sheets TB
I gotta go
Ill send around send around one that grumbles later on babe
See what I can pick up for you you know that
Yeah I got a few things gotta do
Dont worry about it dont worry about it dont worry
Go go go Ive gotta go gotta go gotta gotta go
Gotta go gotta go all right all right
I turned on the radio
If you wanna hear a few tunes Ill turn on the radio for you
There you go there you go there you go baby there you go
Youll be all right too yeah
I know it aint funny it aint runny at all baby
Always laying in the cool room man laying in the cool room
