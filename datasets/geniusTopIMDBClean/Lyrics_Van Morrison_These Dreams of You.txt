I dreamed you paid your dues in Canada
And left me to come through
I headed for the right way
I knew exactly just what to do
I dreamed we played cards in the dark
And you lost and you lied
Wasnt very hard to do
But hurt me deep down inside
Mmmm these dreams of you
So real and so true
These dreams of you
So real and so true
My back was up against the wall
And you slowly just walked away
You never really heard my call
When I cried out that way
With my face against the sun
You pointed out for me to go
Then you said I was the one
Had to reap what you did sow
Mmmm these dreams of you
So real and so true
These dreams of you oh
So real and so true
And hushabye dont ever think about it
Go to sleep dont ever say one word
Close your eyes you are an angel sent down from above
And Ray Charles was shot down
But he got up to do his best
A crowd of people gathered round
To the question answered yes
And you slapped me on the face
I turned around the other cheek
You couldnt really stand the pace
And I would never be so meek
Mmmm these dreams of you
So real and so true
These dreams of you
So real and so true
But hushabye hushabye dont ever think about it
Go to sleep dont ever say one word
Close your eyes you are an angel sent down from above
And it hurts so bad hurts so bad
Dont ever think about it
Dont ever say a word
Close your eyes
