Look at the ivy on the old clingin wall
Look at the flowers and the green grass so tall
Its not a matter of when push comes to shove
Its just the hour on the wings of a dove
Thats just warm love
Its just warm love
I dig it when youre fancy dressed up in lace
I dig it when you have a smile on your face
This inspirations got to be on the flow
These invitations got to see it and know
Its just warm love
Its just warm love
And its everpresent everywhere
And its everpresent everywhere
Warm love
And its everpresent everywhere
And its everpresent everywhere
That warm love
To the country Im goin
Lay and laugh in the sun
You can bring your guitar along
Well sing some songs and have some fun
The sky is cryin and its time to go home
And we shall hurry to the car from the foam
Sit by the fire and dry out our wet clothes
Its rainin outside from the skies up above
Inside its warm love
Inside its warm love
And its everpresent everywhere
And its everpresent everywhere
That warm love
And its everpresent everywhere
And its everpresent everywhere
That warm love
Cant you feel it
And its everpresent everywhere
And its everpresent everywhere
That warm love
And its everpresent everywhere
And its everpresent everywhere
That warm love
And its everpresent everywhere
And its everpresent everywhere
That warm love
