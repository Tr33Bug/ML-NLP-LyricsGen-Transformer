Whenever God shines His light on me
Open up my eyes so I can see
When I look up in the darkest night
And I know everything is gonna be alright
In deep confusion in great despair
When I reach out for Him He is there
When I am lonely as I can be
And I know that God shines His light on me
Reach out for Him  Reach out for Him 
Hell be there  Hell be there 
With Him your troubles  With Him your troubles 
You can share  You can share 
If you live  If you live  the life you love  The life you love 
You get the blessing  Yeah  from above  From above 
Heals the sick and He heals the lame
Says you can do it too in Jesus name
Hell lift you up and Hell turn you around
And put your feet back  Put your feet back  on higher ground
Reach out for Him  Reach out for Him 
Hell be there  Hell be there 
With Him your troubles  With Him your troubles 
You can share  You can share 
Oh you can use His higher power
Every day  Every day  and any hour  Any hour 
Heals the sick and He heals the lame
And He says you can heal it too in Jesus name
He lifts you up and He turns you around
Puts your feet back  Put your feet back 
On higher ground  On higher ground 


Yeah when He shines His light
Whenever God shines His light on you on you
He is the way He is the truth He is the light ooh
Put your feet back put your feet back on higher ground
Put your feet back higher ground
Put your feet back put your feet back on higher ground
Put your feet back on higher ground
Put your feet back put your feet back on higher ground
Put your feet back ooh on higher ground
