As you brush your shoes stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair grab your coat and hat
And you walk wet streets tryin to remember
All the wild night breezes in your memry ever
And everything looks so complete
When youre walkin out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin cryin
Ooowoowee wild night is calling
Ooooohwee wild night is calling
All the girls walk by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogiewoogie on the corner of the street
And the people passin by stare in wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder
And everything looks so complete
When youre walkin out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin cryin
Ooowoowee wild night is calling
Ooooohwee wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
The wild night is calling
Come on out and dance
Whoa come on out and make romance
Come on out and dance
Come on out make romance
