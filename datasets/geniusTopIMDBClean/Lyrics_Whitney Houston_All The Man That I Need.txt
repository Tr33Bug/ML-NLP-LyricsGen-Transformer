I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before he came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now hes here
Its not the same its not the same
He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than Ive ever seen
Hes all Ive got
Hes all Ive got in this world
But hes all the man that I need
And in the morning when I kiss his eyes
He takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening
When the moon is high
He holds me close and wont let go
He wont let go
He fills me up
He gives me love
More love than Ive ever seen
Hes all Ive got
Hes all Ive got in this world
But hes all the man that I need
He fills me up
He fills me up 
He gives me love
More love than Ive ever seen
More love than Ive ever seen 
Hes all Ive got
Hes all Ive got 
Hes all Ive got in this world
But hes all the man that I need
All the man all the man I need 
He fills me up
He fills me up 
He gives me love
More more love more love more love more love
More love than Ive ever seen 
Hes all Ive got
Hes all Ive got 
Hes all Ive got in this world
But hes all the man all the man
All the man all the man I need 
He fills me up  Woo
More love than Ive ever seen 
Hes all Ive got 
All the man all the man I need
