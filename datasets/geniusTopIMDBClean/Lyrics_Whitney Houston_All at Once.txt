All at once
I finally took a moment and Im realizing that
Youre not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
All at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once
Ever since I met you
Youre the only love Ive known
And I cant forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once Im drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing youd come back to me
And thats all that matters now
All at once Im drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
All at once
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone elses arms
And all my dreams were shattered all at once
All at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone elses day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories all at once
Ever since I met you
Youre the only love Ive known
And I cant forget you
Though I must face it all alone


All at once Im drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing youd come back to me
And thats all that matters now
All at once Im drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
