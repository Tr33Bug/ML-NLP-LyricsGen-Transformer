Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me I will be there
Dont be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me
I can see its hurting you
I can feel your pain
Its hard to see the sunshine through the rain
I know sometimes it seems as if
Its never gonna end
But youll get through it
Just dont give in because you can

A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong

A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me I will be there

Where our faith in love begins
You should reach to find the truth in love
