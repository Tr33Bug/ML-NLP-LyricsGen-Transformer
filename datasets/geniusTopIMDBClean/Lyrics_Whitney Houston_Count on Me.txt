Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me I will be there
Dont be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me

Its hard to see the sunshine through the rain
I know sometimes it seems as if
Its never gonna end
But youll get through it
Just dont give in because you can
Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong

A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me I will be there
Dont be afraid
Please believe me when I say
Count on me
Theres a place inside all of us
Where our faith in love begins
You should reach to find the truth in love
The answers there within oh

Its much harder than it really is
But well get through it
Just  just  dont  dont  give in
Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end
When you are weak I will be strong
Helping you to carry on
Call on me I will be there
