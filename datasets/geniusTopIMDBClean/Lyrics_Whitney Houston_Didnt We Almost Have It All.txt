Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again
Didnt we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didnt we almost have it all
The night we hold on til the morning
You know youll never love that way again
Didnt we almost have it all
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again
Didnt we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didnt we almost have it all
The night we hold on til the morning
You know youll never love that way again
Didnt we almost have it all
Didnt we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldnt we reach inside and find
The world of me and you
Well never lose it again
Because once you know what love is
You never let it end
Didnt we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didnt we almost have it all
The night we hold on til the morning
You know youll never love that way again
Didnt we almost have it all
Didnt we almost have it all
