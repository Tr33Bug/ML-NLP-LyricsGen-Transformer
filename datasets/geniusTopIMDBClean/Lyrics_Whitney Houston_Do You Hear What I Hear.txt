Do you hear what I hear
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear  Hear what I hear 
Ringing through the night shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear  Hear what I hear 
A song a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know  Know what I know 
In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know  Know what I know 
A child a child shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold oh yeah oh
Said the king to the people everywhere yeah
Listen to what I say  To what I say 
Pray for peace  Peace  people everywhere
Listen to what I say  To what I say 
Oh a child a child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light yes He will
He will bring us goodness and light yes He will
I know He will oh yes He will
Do you hear what I hear 
Do you hear Do you hear
Do you hear what I hear 
Do you hear Do you know
Do you hear what I hear 
What I know what I hear

What I hear do you know do you know

Do you know do you know
