Exhale  Shoop Shoop  Lyrics
Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes its wrong
And sometimes its right
For every win
Someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale  Yeah yeah say 
Shoop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop  Yeah 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
All you got to say is shoo be doop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop  Shoo be doop 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doo
Sometimes youll laugh
Sometimes youll cry
Life never tells us
The whens or whys
When youve got friends to wish you well
Youll find a point when
You will exhale  Yeah yeah say 
Shoop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop  Shoo shoo shoo huh

Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop  Say shoohoo say sho 
Shoo Be Doo  Be doo oh 
Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul theres
Answers to your prayers
If youre searching for
A place you know
A familiar face
Somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
Youre halfway there
Sometimes youll laugh
Sometimes youll cry
Life never tells us
The whens or whys
When youve got friends to wish you well
Youll find a point when
You will exhale  Yeah yeah say 
Shoop Shoop Shoop  Shoo Be 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop  Shoo Be 
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop  Shoo Be
