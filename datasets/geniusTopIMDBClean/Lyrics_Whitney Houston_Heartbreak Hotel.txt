This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

This is the Heartbreak Hotel
You said youd be here by nine
Instead you took your time
You didnt think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why you do this to me  Mmm oh baby 
Since youre not around for me
To tell you baby face to face
Im writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
Whatd you do to me
Look what you did to me  Oh baby 
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Do me right 
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
Made me cry 
Whatd you do to me
Cant take what you did to me
Now I see that youve been doing wrong
Played me all along
And made a fool of me baby  Ah 
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldnt find out
That you were cheating on me baby
How could you do it to me


Since youre not around for me
To tell you baby face to face  Mmmmm 
Im writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say oh
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
Whatd you do to me  All you did was lie to me baby 
Look what you did to me  Cant believe what you did to me yeah 
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
Whatd you do to me  Whyd you do it
