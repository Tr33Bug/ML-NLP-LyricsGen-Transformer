Think about it there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it life is wasted time
Look inside your heart and Ill look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere  Everywhere 
In this whole world what is fair
We will walk the line and try to see  Try to see 
Falling behind in what could be ohooh oh
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love oh

Wheres that higher love I keep thinking of
Worlds are turning and were just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning yeah and its real to me
There must be someone whos feeling for me yeah
Things look so bad everywhere  Everywhere 
In this whole world what is fair
We walk the line and try to see  Try to see
