Why should I feel discouraged
And Why should the shadows shadows come
Lord Why Why Why should my heart my heart feel lonely
And long for heaven heaven and home ohyes
When when Jesus Jesus is he is my portion
A A constant Friend constant Friend is He
Oh ohoh his eye is on his eye is on the sparrow
Oh yes I I know He watches all over me
