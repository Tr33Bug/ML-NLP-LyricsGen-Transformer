Home  Live  LyricsWhen I think of home
I think of a place where theres
Love overflowing
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there
With the things Ive been knowing
Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall
Have a meaning
Sprinkling the scene
Makes it all clean
Maybe theres a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It sure would be nice to be back home
Where theres love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time
To slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time please be my friendand let me start again
Suddenly my world is gonna change its face
But I still know where Im going
I have had my mind spun around and around
In space
And yet Ive watched it growing
Oh I know youre listening Lord
So wont you please dont make it hard
I know I shouldnt believe everything everything
That things we see
Tell me should I try and stay
Or maybe I should run away
Would it be better better
Just to let things be
Living here in this brandnew world
Might be a fantasy yes it might be
But it taught me to love
So I know that its real its real real to me
And Ive learned that we must look
Inside our hearts to find
Yeah we gotta find
A world full of love
Like yours like mine
