Theres a boy I know hes the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes takes me to the clouds above
Ooh I lose control cant seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming tell me is it really love
Ooh how will I know  Dont trust your feelings 
How will I know
How will I know  Love can be deceiving 
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
Im asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if hes thinking of me
I try to phone but Im too shy  Cant speak 
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
Oh wake me Im shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said theres no mistakin
What I feel is really love
Ooh tell me
How will I know  Dont trust your feelings 
How will I know
How will I know  Love can be deceiving 
How will I know
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
Im asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if hes thinking of me
I try to phone but Im too shy  Cant speak 
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak


If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh how will I know
How will I know
How will I know
Hey how will I know
How will I know if he really loves me
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
Im asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if hes thinking of me
I try to phone but Im too shy  Cant speak 
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak
How will I know  How will I know 
How will I know
How will I know  I say a prayer 
How will I know Ooh
How will I know  I fall in love 
How will I know

Im asking you
