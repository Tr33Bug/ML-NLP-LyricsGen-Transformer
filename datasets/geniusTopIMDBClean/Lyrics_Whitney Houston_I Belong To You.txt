In a world where dreams are few
Youve got me baby Ive got you
Youre the one that makes me feel brand new
Sometimes love can wear you out
Chill your soul baby make you doubt
Thats youll never find the one thats true
All my life Ive longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Lets seal this moment with a kiss
I want to know
And nothins gonna stop me because
Ive been to the bottom
But Im back on top
And Im feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you
Though Im not afraid to let it show
Ill tell the world I want everyone to know
Theres nobody who does me like you do boy
All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothing has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothins gonna stop me because
Ive been to the bottom
But Im back on top
And Im feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you
When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you
To you
Say that you love me boy and Ill make it right Oh yeah
Ill rock your heart and soul til the morning light
Boy no
I will oh yeah yeah
You know I belong to you
And you belong to me
All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothing has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothins gonna stop me because
Ive been to the bottom
But Im back on top
And Im feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When you get down to it
I belong to you
When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you
To you
