Mmm yeah
Lost touch with my soul
I had nowhere to turn I had nowhere to go
Lost sight of my dream
Thought it would be the end of me
I thought Id never make it through
I had no hope to hold on to
I I thought I would break
I didnt know my own strength
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
I didnt know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour my faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didnt know my own strength
Found hope in my heart
I found the light to life my way out of the dark
Found all that I need here inside of me oh
I thought Id never find my way
I thought Id never lift that weight
I thought I would break
I didnt know my own strength
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
I didnt know my own strength
Survived my darkest hour my faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didnt know my own strength


There were so many times I wondered
How Id get through the night
I thought I took all that I could take
I didnt know my own strength
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
Oh I didnt know my own strength
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up I hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didnt know my own strength
I was not built to break no no
I got to know my own strength
