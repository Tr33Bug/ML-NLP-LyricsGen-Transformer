Share my life take me for what I am
Cause Ill never change all my colors for you
Take my love Ill never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do
I dont really need to look very much further
I dont wanna have to go where you dont follow
I wont hold it back again this passion inside
Cant run from myself theres nowhere to hide
But dont make me close one more door
I dont wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Dont walk away from me
I have nothing nothing nothing
If I dont have you you you you you
You see through right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love mm
I never knew love like Ive known it with you
Will a memory survive one I can hold on to
I dont really need to look very much further
I dont wanna have to go where you dont follow
I wont hold it back again this passion inside
I cant run from myself theres nowhere to hide
Your love Ill remember forever
But dont make me close one more door
I dont wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Dont walk away from me
I have nothing nothing nothing
Dont make me close one more door
I dont wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Dont walk away from me no
Dont walk away from me
Dont you dare walk away from me
I have nothing nothing nothing
If I dont have you you
If I dont have you oh you
