Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments
Who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know
I know him well
Wasnt it good
Wasnt it fine
Isnt it madness he cant be mine
But in the end
He needs a little more than before
Security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back
I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then
Wasnt it good  oh so good 
Wasnt it fine  so fine 
Isnt it madness he cant be mine


Didnt I know how it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart
Wasnt it fine
Isnt it madness he cant be mine
But in the end
He needs a little more than before
Security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took some to understand him
Hoo ooh
I know him so well
