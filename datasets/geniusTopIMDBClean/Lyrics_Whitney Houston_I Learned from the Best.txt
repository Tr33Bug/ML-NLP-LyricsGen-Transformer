Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart one more time oh no no
Did you think that Id still care
That thered be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back in my life
So you found you miss the love you threw away
Baby but you found it out too late too Late
And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you  Oh baby now 
I learned from you
I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye your goodbye baby
Wouldve sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now youre the last thing on my mind
Now you say youre sorry and
Youve changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late
And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you  Oh baby now 
I learned from you
So when all youve got are sleepless nights
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you who said goodbye
Who said goodbye
And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you
Learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you
I learned from the best
I learned from you
