As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
Im lost without a cause
After giving it my all
Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that Ive been through
Who on earth can I turn to
I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you yeah
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you
About to lose my breath
Theres no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door
And every road that Ive taken mmm
Led to my regret
And I dont know if Im gon make it
Nothing to do but lift my head
I look to you
I look to you yeah
And when all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you oh yeah
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you
My levees are broken  Oh Lord 
My walls have come  Coming down on me 
Theyre running down on me  All the rain is falling 
The rain is falling  Woo 
Defeat is calling  Set me free 
I need you to set me free
Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me
I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you yeah
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song
I look to you yeah
I look to you
Ooh
I look to you
