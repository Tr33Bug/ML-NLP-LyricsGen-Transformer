I love the the Lord he heard my cry
And pitied every groan long as I I live
And troubles rise I hasten to his throne
Oh I love the Lord
I sure do surely do love the Lord
He heard he heard my cry
And pitied every groan yes he did
Every groan
Long as I live long as I I live
And troubles rise troubles rise
