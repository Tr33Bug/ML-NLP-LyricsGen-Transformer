I Wanna Dance with Somebody  Who Loves Me  Lyrics
Ah
Yeah woo
Hey yeah ah
Ooh yeah uhhuh
Yeah
I wanna dance
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
Ive done alright up til now
Its the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
The loneliness calls
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ive been in love and lost to my senses
Spinnin through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feelin down
I need a man wholl take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me


Somebody who somebody who
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody who somebody who
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man wholl take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ooh ooh  Dance
