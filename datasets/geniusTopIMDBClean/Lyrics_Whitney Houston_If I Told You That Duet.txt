If I Told You That  Duet  Lyrics
Darkchild
Hey baby
Hahaha
If I told you that
I wanted to see you
And if I told you that
I beg to please you
If I told you that
Ill always keep you
What would you say
If I told you that
Now tell me how youd feel
If I told you that I
Had feelings for you yeah
Tell me baby
And would it be so wrong
To say whats on my mind
Im sorry I have to
Baby baby
And were friends but with time
What I feel deep inside  What I feel inside 
For you  For you  has changed  Has changed 
But Id give up on love  Ooh 
If I thought that it was  If I thought it was 
Untrue  Untrue  for you  For you baby 
If I told you that  Uhhuh

And if I told you that  And if I told you

If I told you that  If I told you 
Ill always keep you  If I told you always keep you 
What would you say
If I told you that  Uh 


I know that we were just friends
But what if I decide
To bring something in ooh yeah
Baby baby
I hope it wont offend
The trust we have cause I
Dont want this to end
No no no baby
If you think we will lose what we have
Then Id just rather stay  Rather stay  the same  Rather stay the same 
Because I dont want to choose  I dont wanna choose 
Between two of the most precious things  Precious things  to me  To me 
If I told you that  I told you that 
I wanted  I wanted  to see you  I wanted to see you 
And if I told you that  If I told you 
I beg to please you  Id beg to please you 
If I told you that  My love 
Ill always keep you  Ill always keep you 
What would you say  What would you say 
If I told you that
If we  If we  take this chance  Take this chance 
And extend to each other romance
I hope  Baby I hope  it would be  It would be 
The right thing for you and me oh
