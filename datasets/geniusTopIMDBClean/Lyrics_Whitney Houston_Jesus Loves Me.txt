Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
Jesus loves me this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to him belong
They are weak but he is strong
Yes Jesus loves me
Oh yes Jesus loves me
Yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
Pressing on the upward way
Always guide me Lord I pray
Undeserving and stubbornly never fail to love me still
Yes Jesus loves me
Oh yes Jesus loves me
Oh yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
Yes Jesus loves me love
Oh yes Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so
For the Bible tells me so
Feels so good to know  that Im never alone
See sometimes Im lonely but never alone
For the Bible tells for the Bible tells
For the Bible tells me so
See I know that he loves me
Whether Im right whether Im wrong
