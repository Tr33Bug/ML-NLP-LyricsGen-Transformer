How could I throw away a miracle
How could I face another day
Its all of my doing I made a choice
And today I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand the way I feel
How could you relate to so much pain
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today I pray
That someone should listen for
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
Theres a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Dont throw love away
Theres a miracle in store
How could I let go of a miracle
Nothing cold ever take its place
Thought I was looking out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me
Lord less today I pray
That you should come listen
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
Theres a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Dont throw love away
Theres a miracle in store


Dont ever throw away your miracle
Dont let it slip away
Nothing should matter
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
Theres a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Dont throw love away
Theres a miracle in store
