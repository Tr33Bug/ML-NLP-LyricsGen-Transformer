My Love is Your Love  Remix  Lyrics
Yo Whitney and Wyclef
Turn this up you gonna feel it up
Yo if I became broke tomorrow
Would I still be your pharaoh
Your ghetto Prince of Egypt
And if I got into a motorcycle accident and crashed
And became paraplegic
Yeah and if the feds rush the door
And find guns on the floor
And took us to federal court
Would you say they were yours
If I had to do a bid
Would you take care of the kids
And never let another nig in the crib
Keep the kitty licked yeah
Kristina 
If tomorrow is judgment day  sing mommy 
And Im standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War Three
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
Its okay if youre coming with me
Your love is my love and my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldnt hold us
If I lose my fame and fortune
It really dont matter 
And Im homeless on the streets
And Im sleeping in Grand Central Station  okay 
Its okay if youre sleeping with me  baby 
As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each others eyes
Each others eyes 
And no matter how old we get ooh
Its okay as long as I got you baby yeah yeah yeah


If I should die this very day
Dont cry cause on Earth
We wasnt meant to stay
And no matter what the people say
It really wont matter 
Ill be waiting for you
After the judgment day
Now I lay me down to rest
I pray that life dont get you stressed
If you should cry if you should break
I pray these streets dont take your life
Means more to me than that Rolley with the plat
Heard that Believe that I aint letting none of that
Go down when the feds come tell em none they my guns
And if they see me in the streets and wanna take my dough
Take my clothes for that price you can have my life
Yall shouting Dyme thats my name
Chicks spit fire Im putting out the flame
For life wifee mommy to baby girl
I wouldnt give it up for all the money in the world
Oh my time is up bricks to Mt Vernon
Clef and All Star bring in Whitney Houston
Kristina 
Collabo All Star East Side
Refugee Camp from the basement West Side
Clap your hands 
And it dont stop South Side
Clap your hands 
And me North Side
I said the record is not over yet 
Clap your hands
