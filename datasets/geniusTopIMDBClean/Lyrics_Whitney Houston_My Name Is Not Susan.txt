One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didnt last
Now Romeo you know I cant believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right next time
Thats the end of me
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Dont want to hear about Susan
Shes got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
No no no no no  get it right 
Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same
Now Romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say goodbye to me boy
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Dont want to hear about Susan
Shes got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Dont want to hear about Susan
Shes got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
I never want to be the girly that you call one and only
You know the kind of girl
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name
Well anyway
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Dont want to hear about Susan
Shes got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
Dont want to hear about Susan
My name aint Susan
Ya better get it right
