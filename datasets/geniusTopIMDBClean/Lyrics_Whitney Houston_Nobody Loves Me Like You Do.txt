Like a candle burning bright
Love is glowing in your eyes
A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
But now I have you
Nobody loves me like you do
Like a leaf upon the wind
I could find no place to land
I dreamed the hours away
And wondered everyday
Do dreams come true
Nobody loves me like you do
What if Id never met you
Where would I be right now
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Youve touched my heart in places that I never even knew
Cause nobody loves me like you do
I was words without a tune
I was a song still unsung
A poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now theres you
Baby nobody loves me like you do
What if Id never met you
Where would I be right now
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
Youve touched my heart in places that I never even knew
Nobody loves me  Nobody loves me 
Nobody loves me  Nobody loves me 
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody loves me like you do
