I know that when you look at me
Theres so much that you just dont see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart youd find
Oh a girl whos scared sometimes
Who isnt always strong
Cant you see the hurt in me
I feel so all alone
I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Wont you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me will you stay
Or will you run away
Each day each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night I come home and turn the key
Theres nobody there no one cares for me
Oh whats the sense
Of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with
Tell me what does it mean
I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Wont you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me will you stay
Or will you run away
Run away
I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears no
If you only knew
How much


I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Wont you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm
Ill run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me will you stay
Or will you run away
