A few stolen moments is all that we shared
Youve got your family and they need you there
Though I try to resist being last on your list
But no other mans gonna do
So Im saving all my love for you
Its not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
Cause Id rather be home feeling blue
So Im saving all my love for you
You used to tell me wed run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said Be patient just wait a little longer
But thats just an old fantasy
Ive got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright
Well be making love the whole night through
So Im saving all my love
Yes Im saving all my love
Yes Im saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna love you more
Cause tonight is the night that Im feeling alright
Well be making love the whole night through
So Im saving all my love
Yeah Im saving all my loving
Yes Im saving all my love for you
For you for you
