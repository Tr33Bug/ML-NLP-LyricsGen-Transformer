Well theres a bridge and theres a river that I still must cross
As Im going on my journey
Oh I might be lost
And theres a road I have to follow a place I have to go
Well noone told me just how to get there
But when I get there Ill know
Because Im taking it
Step by step bit by bit
Stone by stone  Yeah  brick by brick  Oh yeah 
Step by step day by day mile by mile  Ooh ooh ooh 
And this old road is rough and ruined
So many dangers along the way
So many burdens might fall upon me
So many troubles that I have to face
Oh but I wont let my spirit fail me
Oh I wont let my spirit go
Until I get to my destination
Im going to take it slowly because Im making it mine
Step by step  You know Im taking it 
Bit by bit  Bit by bit come move
