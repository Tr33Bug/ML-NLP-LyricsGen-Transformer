Oh say can you see by the dawns early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
Oer the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that starspangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave
