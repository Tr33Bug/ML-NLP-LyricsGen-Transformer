Im wiser now
Im not the foolish girl you used to know
So long ago
Im stronger now
Ive learned from my mistakes which way to go
And I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone
And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I dont care if Im right or wrong
Ill live my life the way I feel
No matter what Ill keep it real you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeahyeahyeah mmm yeahyeah
Its over now
I cant go back to living through your eyes
Too many lies
And if you dont know by now
I cant go back to being someone else
Not anymore
I never had a chance to do things my way
So now its time for me to take control
And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I dont care if Im right or wrong
Ill live my life the way I feel
No matter what Im gonna keep it real you know
Time for me to do it  Oh 
I start again go back to one
Im running things my way  My way 
Cant stop me now Ive just begun
Dont even think about it
There aint no way about it
Im taking names the world is mine
Yes Im going to take my turn
Its time for me to finally stand alone stand alone
I am not afraid to try it on my own
And I dont care if Im right or wrong
Ill live my life the way I feel
No matter what Im gonna keep it real you know
Its time for me to do it see Im not afraid
I am not afraid  to try it on my own
And I dont care if Im right or wrong
Ill live my life the way I feel
No matter what Im gonna keep it real you know
Its time for me to do it on my own
Yeah on
On my own
