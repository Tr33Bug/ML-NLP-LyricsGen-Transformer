I know its been some time
But theres something on my mind
You see
I havent been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing
I learned
Is that I need you desperately
So here I am
And can you please tell me
Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love thats waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Wont they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
Ooh baby
Ive been around enough to know
That dreams dont turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No you just cant run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
Youre always on my mind
So here I am
And can you please tell me
Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love thats waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Wont they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
And now that I am here with you
Ill never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know now I know
Where do broken hearts go
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love thats waiting there
And if somebody loves you
Wont they always love you
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care for me
