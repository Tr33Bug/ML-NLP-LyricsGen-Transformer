I found out what Ive been missing
Always on the run
Ive been looking for someone
Now youre here like youve been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby you give good love
Never stopping
I was always searching for that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of
Now youre here like youve been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby you give good love
Now I I cant stop looking around
Its not what this loves all about
Our love is here to stay stay
Now youre here like youve been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see that you give good love to me
Baby so good
Take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me
Never too much
Baby you give good love
