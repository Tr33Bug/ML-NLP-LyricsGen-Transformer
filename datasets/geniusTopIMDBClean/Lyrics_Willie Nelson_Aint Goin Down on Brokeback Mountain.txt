Now Ive been up the Chisholm Trail
Been through Death Valley hot as hell
I rode across the dusty plains
Theres cowboy runnin through my veins
But I aint goin down on Brokeback Mountan
No I aint goin down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
Well Ive watched the heard from dusk til dawn
But I did it with my britches on
You can have a chew you can bum a smoke
But dont go reachin for my rope
I aint goin down on Brokeback Mountan
No I aint goin down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
solo 
Whoa Willy that last note sounded a might queer 
What you dos your business hoss
You can buy me a beer and then fuck off
But I aint goin down on Brokeback Mountan
No I aint goin down on Brokeback Mountain
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right  That shit aint right 
That shit aint right
Oh what the hell 
Oh thats my saddle horn  Thank Goodness
