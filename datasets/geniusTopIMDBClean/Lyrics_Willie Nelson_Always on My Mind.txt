Maybe I didnt love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didnt treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl Im sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
And maybe I didnt hold you
All those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you
Im so happy that youre mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me tell me that your
Sweet love hasnt died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
