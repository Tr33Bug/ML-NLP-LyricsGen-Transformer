Look around you
Look down the bar from you
The lonely faces that you see
Are you sure that this is where you want to be
These are your friends
But are they real friends
Do they love you as much as me
Are you sure that this is where you want to be
Please dont let my tears persuade you
I had hoped I wouldnt cry
But lately teardrops seem a part of me
So look around you
And take a good look
And just between you and me
Are you sure that this is where you want to be
