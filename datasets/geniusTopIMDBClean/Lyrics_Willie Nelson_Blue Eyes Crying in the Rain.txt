In the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew wed never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages Ill remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
Well stroll handinhand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life Ive loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven
Blue eyes crying in the rain
