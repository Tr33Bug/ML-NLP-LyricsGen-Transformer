Well he rode into Blue Rock dusty and tired
And he got him a room for the night
He lay there in silence with too much on his mind
Still hoping that he was not right
But he found them that evening at a tavern in town
In a quiet little outoftheway place
And they smiled at each other when he walked through the door
And they died with their smiles on their faces
They died with a smile on their face
Dont boss him dont cross him hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him just wait til tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
