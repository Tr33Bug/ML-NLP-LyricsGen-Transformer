Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue birds singing a song
Nothing but blue skies from now on
I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When youre in love my how they fly by
Blue days all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
