Laugh with me buddy jest with me buddy
Dont let her get the best of me buddy
Dont ever let me start feeling lonely
If I ever needed you buddy
You know now I really do buddy
Dont ever let me start feeling lonely
I cry at the least little thing buddy
And Ill die if you mention her name buddy

Lets dont let her get away with it buddy
Dont ever let me start feeling lonely
Lets talk about things as they were buddy
Before I got mixed up with her buddy
Laugh with me buddy jest with me buddy
Lets dont let her get the best of me buddy
Dont ever let me start feeling lonely
