Can I sleep in your arms tonight lady
Its so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you
And I assure you Ill do you no wrong
Dont know why but the one I love left me
Left me lonely and cold and so weak
And I need someones arms to hold me
Til Im strong enough to get back on my feet
Can I sleep in your arms
Can I sleep in your arms
Can I sleep in your arms tonight lady
Its so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you Ill do you no wrong
Can I sleep in your arms tonight lady
Its so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you and
I assure you Ill do you no wrong
