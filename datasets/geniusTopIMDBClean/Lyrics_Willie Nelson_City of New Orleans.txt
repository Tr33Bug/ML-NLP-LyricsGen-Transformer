Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twentyfive sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name
And freightyards full of old black men
And graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you
Say dont you know me Im your native son
Im the train they call the City of New Orleans
And Ill be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Dealing cards with an old man in the club car
Penny a point aint no one keeping score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels rumbling beneath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep rocking to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good morning America how are you
Say dont you know me Im your native son
Im the train they call the City of New Orleans
And Ill be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home well be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still aint heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues


Good morning America how are you
Say dont you know me Im your native son
Im the train they call the City of New Orleans
And Ill be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
