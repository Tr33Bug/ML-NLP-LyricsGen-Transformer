Well theres many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
Theres many a young boy who feels things he cant comprehend
And a small town dont like it when somebody falls between sexes
No a small town dont like it when a cowboy has feelings for men
And I believe to my soul that inside every man theres the feminine
And inside every lady theres a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well a cowboy may brag about things that hes done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say what do you think all them saddles and boots was about
And theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out
And theres always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someones the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy dont treat him like he was a sister
You cant fuck with a lady thats sleepin in each cowboys head
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about
And theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady theres a cowboy who wants to come out
And inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out
