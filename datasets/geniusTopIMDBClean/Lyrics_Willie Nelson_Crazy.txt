Im crazy crazy for feeling so lonely
Im crazy crazy for feeling so blue
I knew that youd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday youd leave me for somebody new
Worry why do I let myself worry
Wondering what in the world did I do
Im crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
Im crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And Im crazy for loving you
Im crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
Im crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And Im crazy for loving you
