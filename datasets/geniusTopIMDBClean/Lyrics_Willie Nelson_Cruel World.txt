Cruel cruel world must I go on
Cruel cruel world Im moving on
Ive been living too fast
And Ive been living too wrong
Cruel cruel world Im gone
This big ol world sure got me running round
I heard a voice that said Just settle down
And with the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I am homeward bound
Cruel cruel world must I go on
Cruel cruel world Im moving on
Ive been living too fast
And Ive been living too wrong
Cruel cruel world Im gone
Desert roads desert plains
I have seen so much pain
Now I see into the eyes of a girl
No more no more cruel world
Cruel cruel world must I go on
Cruel cruel world Im moving on
Ive been living too fast
And Ive been living too wrong
Cruel cruel world Im gone
Dusty trail saw vapor light
Was it a mirage I dont know but it seemed right
I felt mission I felt trust
I knew then that I must
Must go to her from this cruel world
Cruel cruel world must I go on
Cruel cruel world Im moving on
Ive been living too fast
And Ive been living too wrong
Cruel cruel world Im gone
Cruel cruel world must I go on
Cruel cruel world Im moving on
Ive been living too fast
And Ive been living too wrong
Cruel cruel world Im gone
Cruel cruel world Im gone
