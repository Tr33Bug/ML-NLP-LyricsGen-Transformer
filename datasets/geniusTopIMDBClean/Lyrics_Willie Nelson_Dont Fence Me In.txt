Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above
Dont fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Dont fence me in
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above
Dont fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Dont fence me in
Just turn me loose let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses
Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above
Dont fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Dont fence me in
