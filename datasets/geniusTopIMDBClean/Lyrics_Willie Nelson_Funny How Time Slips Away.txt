Well hello there
My its been a long long time
How am I doing
Oh I guess that Im doing fine
Its been so long now
But it seems now that it was only yesterday
Gee aint it funny
How time slips away
Hows your new love
I hope that hes doing fine
I heard you told him
That youd love him til the end of time
Now thats the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee aint it funny
How time slips away
I gotta go now
I guess Ill see you around
Dont know when though
Never know when Ill be back in town
But remember what I tell you
In time youre gonna pay
And its surprising how time slips away
