I did the best I could do
But the best I could tell
The higher I flew
The farther I fell
Born in the mud
Raised in the wild
Washed in the blood
Gods problem child
I feel the shine
Following me
Not far behind
Thats where I wanna be
A little out of time
Fine by me
Darkness may fall
We still got a light
Keeping us all
Safe through the night
Heaven must love
Gods problem child
Heaven must love
Gods problem child
Heaven must love
Gods problem child
