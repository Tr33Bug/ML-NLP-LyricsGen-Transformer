At a time when the world seems to be spinnin
Hopelessly out of control
Theres deceivers and believers and old inbetweeners
That seem to have no place to go
Well its the same old song its right and its wrong
And living is just something that I do
And with no place to hide I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you
I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And Ive nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hands on the wheel
Ive something thats real
And I feel like Im going home
And in the shade of an oak down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Setting sail spinning tales and fishing for whales
With a lady they both enjoy
Well its the same damn tune
Its the man in the moon
Its the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you
And I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And Ive nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hands on the wheel
Ive something thats real
And I feel like Im going home
