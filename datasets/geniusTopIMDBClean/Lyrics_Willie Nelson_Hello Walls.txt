Hello walls  hello hello  howd things go for you today
Dont you miss her since she up and walked away
And Ill bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls Ill keep you company
Hello window  hello hello  well I see that youre still here
Arent you lonely since our darling disappeared
Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane
Now dont you try to tell me that its rain
She went away and left us all alone the way she planned
Guess well have to learn to get along without her if we can
Hello ceiling  hello hello  Im going to stare at you a while
You know I cant sleep so wont you bear with me a while
We gotta all stick together or else Ill lose my mind
I got a feeling shell be gone a long long time
