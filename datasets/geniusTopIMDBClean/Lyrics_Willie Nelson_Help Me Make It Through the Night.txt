Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Playing soft against your skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All Im taking is your time
Help me make it through the night
I dont care if its right or wrong
I dont try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Because tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrows out of sight
And its sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I dont care if its right or wrong
I dont try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Because tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrows out of sight
And its sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
I dont want to be alone
Help me make it through the night
