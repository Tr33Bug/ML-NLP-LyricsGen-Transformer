Well last night I came home and I knocked on my door
And I called to my love as I oft had before
And I knocked and I knocked no answer there came
No kisses to greet me no voice called my name
And I couldnt believe it was true oh Lord
Couldnt believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears and I mustve aged ten years
And I couldnt believe it was true
Well the shock was so great I am quivering yet
And Ill try to forgive but I cannot forget
My heart breaking loss is another mans gain
Her happiness always I hope will remain
And I couldnt believe it was true oh Lord
Couldnt believe it was true
And my eyes filled with tears and I mustve aged ten years
And I couldnt believe it was true
