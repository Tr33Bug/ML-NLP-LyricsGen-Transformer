Now many many years ago
When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be
This widow had a grownup daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed
This made my dad my soninlaw
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
Because she was my fathers wife
To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became
A brotherinlaw to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widows grownup daughter
Who of course was my stepmother
Im my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Im my own grandpa
My fathers wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughters son
My wife is now my mothers mother
And it makes me blue
Because she is my wife
Shes my grandmother too
Im my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Im my own grandpa
Now if my wife is my grandmother
Then I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild
For now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw
As the husband of my grandmother
I am my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Im my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
Im my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
Im my own grandpa
