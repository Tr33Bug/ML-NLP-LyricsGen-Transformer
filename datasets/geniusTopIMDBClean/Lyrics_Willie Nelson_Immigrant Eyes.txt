Oh Ellis Island was swarming
Like a scene from a costume ball
Decked out in the colors of Europe
And on fire with the hope of it all
There my fathers own father stood huddled
With the tired and hungry and scared
Turn of the century pilgrims
Bound by the dream that they shared
They were standing in line just like cattle
Poked and sorted and shoved
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom
Some were torn from someone they love
Through this sprawling Tower of Babel
Came a young man confused and alone
Determined and bound for America
And carrying all that he owned
Sometimes when I looked in my grandfathers immigrant eyes
I saw that day reflected and I couldnt hold my feelings inside
I saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
So dont take it for granted said grandfathers immigrant eyes
He would rock and stare out the window
But his eyes are still just as clear
As the day he sailed through the Harbor
And come ashore on that island of tears
My grandfathers days were numbered
But I wont let his memory die
Cause he gave me the gift of this country
And the look in his immigrant eyes
Sometimes when I looked in my grandfathers immigrant eyes
I saw that day reflected and couldnt hold my feelings inside
I saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
So dont take it for granted said grandfathers immigrant eyes
Dont take it for granted said grandfathers immigrant eyes
