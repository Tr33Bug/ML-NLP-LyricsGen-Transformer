Oh Lord its hard to be humble
When youre perfect in every way
I cant wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better lookin each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord its hard to be humble
But Im doin the best that I can
I used to have me a girlfriend
But I guess that she couldnt compete
With all of them lovestarved women
Who keep clamoring around at my feet
Well I probably could find me another
But I guess theyre all in awe of me  Oh man 
Who cares Ill never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company
Oh Lord its hard to be humble
When youre perfect in every way
I cant wait to look in the mirror
Cause I get better lookin each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord its hard to be humble
But Im doin the best that we can
I guess you could say Im a loner  Yeah 
A cowboy outlaw tough and proud
I could have a lot of friends if I wanted
But then I wouldnt stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that Im egotistical
Hell I dont even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the way
That I fill out my skintight blue jeans
Oh Lord its hard to be humble
When youre perfect in every way
I cant wait to look in the mirror
But I get better lookin each day
To know me is to love me
I must be one hell of a man
Oh Lord its hard to be humble
But Im doin the best that we can
Lord its hard to be humble
But Im doin the best that I can
