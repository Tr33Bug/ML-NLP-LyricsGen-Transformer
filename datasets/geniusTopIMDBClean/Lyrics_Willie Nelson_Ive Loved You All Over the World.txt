Youre my buddy my pal my friend
It will be that way until the end
And wherever you go I want you to know
Youre my buddy my pal my friend
And Ive loved you all over the world
You are my sunshine
You keep my life in a whirl
And you love me sometimes
Ill always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
Ill love you all over the world
Ill always follow my heart
Wherever it takes me
And until death do us part
Ill love you all over the world
