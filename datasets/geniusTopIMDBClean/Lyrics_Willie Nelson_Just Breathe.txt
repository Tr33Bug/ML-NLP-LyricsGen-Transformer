Yes I understand that every life must end uhhuh
As we sit alone I know someday we must go uhhuh
Oh Im a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one yeah others theyve got none uhhuh
Stay with me ohh
Lets just breathe
Practiced on my sins never gonna let you win uhhuh
Under everything just another human being uhhuh
I dont want to hurt
Theres so much in this world to make me believe
Stay with me
Youre all I see
Did I say that I need you
Did I say that I want you
Oh if I didnt Im a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean
I wonder everyday as I look upon your face uhhuh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take uhhuh
Nothing you would take everything you gave
Did I say that I need you Ohoh
Did I say that I want you
Oh if I didnt Im a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean
Nothing you would take everything you gave
Love you till I die meet you on the other side
