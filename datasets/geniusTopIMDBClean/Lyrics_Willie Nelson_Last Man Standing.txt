I dont wanna be the last man standin
Or wait a minute maybe I do
If you dont mind Ill start a new line
And decide after thinkin it through
Go on in front if youre in such a hurry
Like heaven aint waitin for you
I dont wanna be the last man standin
On second thought maybe I do
Its gettin hard to watch my pals check out
Cuts like a wore out knife
One thing I learned about runnin the road
Is forever dont apply to life
Waylon and Ray and Merle and old Norro
Lived just as fast as me
I still got a lotta good friends left
And I wonder who the next will be
I dont wanna be the last man standin
Or wait a minute maybe I do
If you dont mind Ill start a new line
And decide after thinkin it through
Go on in front if youre in such a hurry
Like heaven aint waitin for you
I dont wanna be the last man standin
On second thought maybe I do
Maybe well all meet again
On the other side
Well pick and sing
Load up the buses and ride
I dont wanna be the last man standin
Or wait a minute maybe I do
If you dont mind Ill start a new line
And decide after thinkin it through
Go on in front if youre in such a hurry
Cause hell is awaitin there too
I dont wanna be the last man standin
On second thought maybe I do
Yeah maybe I do
Yeah maybe I do
Yeah maybe I do
