Its been rough and rocky traveling
But Im finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
Im surprised to find my minds still fairly sound
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know Ive said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation me and Paul
Almost busted in Laredo
But for reasons that Id rather not disclose
But if youre staying in a motel there and leave
Just dont leave nothing in your clothes
And at the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul
Its been rough and rocky traveling
But Im finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
Im surprised to find my minds still fairly sound
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know Ive said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation me and Paul
On a package show in Buffalo
With us and Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and were just sitting there
And wed come to play and not just for the ride

Well we drank a lot of whiskey
So I dont know if we went on that night at all
But I dont think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo aint geared for me and Paul
Its been rough and rocky traveling
But Im finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
Im surprised to find my minds still fairly sound
I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know Ive said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation me and Paul
