I turned the sound down on my TV
I just cant listen any more
Its like Im in some foreign country
That Ive never seen before
So come now here to think about it
What in the hell are we goin to do
Cause after all is said and all is done
Its just me and you
Its just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
Theres more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So its just me and you
Its just me and you
I had a friend I used to talk to
We used to both sit on the fence
But anymore I cant relate to him
Cause he aint got a lick of sense
So now I just ask you the questions
But Im the one Im talkin to
The world has gone out of its mind
Except for me and you
Its just me and you
And we are definitely outnumbered
Theres more of them than us
Just when you think you made a new friend
They throw you under the bus
So its just me and you
Its just me and you
Yeah its just me and you
