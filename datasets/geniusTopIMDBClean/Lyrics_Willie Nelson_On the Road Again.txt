One two
One two three four
On the road again
Just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Goin places that Ive never been
Seein things that I may never see again
And I cant wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
Were the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
I just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
Were the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
Just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again
And I cant wait to get on the road again
Alright thank you very muchÂ
