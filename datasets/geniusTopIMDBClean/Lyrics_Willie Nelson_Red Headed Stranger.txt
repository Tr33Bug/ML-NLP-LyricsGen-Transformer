The redheaded stranger from Blue Rock Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The redheaded stranger had eyes like thunder
And his lips they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait til tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
A yellowhaired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
The yellowhaired lady came down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
He just didnt seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait til tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
The yellowhaired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free of course
For you cant hang a man for killing a woman
Whos trying to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And dont lay a hand on the bay
Dont cross him dont boss him
Hes wild in his sorrow
Hes riding and hiding his pain
Dont fight him dont spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe hell ride on again
