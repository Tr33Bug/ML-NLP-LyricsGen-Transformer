Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone dont like it just look em in the eye
I didnt come here and I aint leaving
So dont sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Now you wont see no sad and teary eyes
When I get my wings and its my time to fly
Call my friends and tell em
Theres a party come on by
Now just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone dont like it just look em in the eye
I didnt come here and I aint leaving
So dont sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
When Id go Ive been here long enough
So youll sing and tell more jokes and dance and stuff
Just keep the music playing
Thatll be a good goodbye
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone dont like it just look em in the eye
I didnt come here and I aint leaving
So dont sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Hey take me out and build a roaring fire
Roll me in the flames for about an hour
Then take me out and twist me up
And point me towards the sky
And roll me up and smoke me when I die


Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone dont like it just look em in the eye
I didnt come here and I aint leaving
So dont sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
