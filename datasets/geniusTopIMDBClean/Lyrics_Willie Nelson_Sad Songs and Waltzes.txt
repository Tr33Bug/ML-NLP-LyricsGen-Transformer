Im writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But youve no need to fear it
Cause no one will hear it
Cause sad songs and waltzes
Arent selling this year
Ill tell all about how you cheated
Id like for the whole world to hear
Id like to get even with you
Cause youre leaving
But sad songs and waltzes
Arent selling this year
Its a good thing that Im not a star
You dont know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Cause sad songs and waltzes
Arent selling this year
Its a good thing that Im not a star
You dont know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Cause sad songs and waltzes
Arent selling this year
