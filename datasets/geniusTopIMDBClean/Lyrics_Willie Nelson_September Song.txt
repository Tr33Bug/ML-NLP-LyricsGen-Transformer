Oh its a long long while
From May to December
But the days grow short
When you reach September
When the autumn weather
Turns leaves to flame
One hasnt got time
For the waiting game
Oh the days dwindle down
To a precious few
September November
And these few precious days
Ill spend with you
These precious days
Ill spend with you
Oh the days dwindle down
To a precious few
September November
And these few precious days
Ill spend with you
These precious days
Ill spend with you
These precious days
Ill spend with you
