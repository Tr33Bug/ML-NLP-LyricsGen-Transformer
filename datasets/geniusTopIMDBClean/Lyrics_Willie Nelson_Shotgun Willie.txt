Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willies got all of his family there
Well you cant make a record if you aint got nothing to say
You cant make a record if you aint got nothing to say
You cant play music if you dont know nothing to play
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willies got all of his family there
Now John T Floores was aworking for the Ku Klux Klan
At six foot five John T was a hell of a man
Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willies got all of his family there
