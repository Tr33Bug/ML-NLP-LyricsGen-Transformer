When you lose the one you love
You think your world has ended
You think your world will be a waste of life
Without them in it
You feel theres no way to go on
Life is just a sad sad song
But love is bigger than us all
The end is not the end at all
Its not somethin you get over
But its somethin you get through
Its not ours to be taken
Its just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when its gone
It lives in someone new
Its not somethin you get over
But its somethin you get through
Its not somethin you get over
But its somethin you get through
Its not ours to be taken
Its just a thing we get to do
Life goes on and on
And when its gone
It lives in someone new
Its not somethin you get over
But its somethin you get through
Its not somethin you get over
But its somethin you get through
