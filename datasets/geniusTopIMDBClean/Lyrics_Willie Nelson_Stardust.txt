Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside the garden wall when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of loves refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of loves refrain
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of loves refrain
