Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light I lost my eyesight
I aint been that drunk in awhile
Along about one I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Ive got 2020 vision when I aint drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I aint never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Well I made up my mind I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape that Im in
I done spotted me another queen
Sittin at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes I thought Id been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a ten
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two
Ive got 2020 vision when I aint drinking
But Lord when I get on that booze
I aint never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at two with a ten
But at ten I woke up with a two


Now you may laugh
But if youve got the cash
Ill bet you ten to one you have too
