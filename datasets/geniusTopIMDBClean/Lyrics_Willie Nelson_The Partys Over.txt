Turn out the lights the partys over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night the partys over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again
What a crazy crazy party never seen so many people
Laughing dancing look at you youre having fun
But look at me Im almost crying
But that dont keep her love from dying
Misery cause for me the partys over
Turn out the lights the partys over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night the partys over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again
Once I had a love undying I didnt keep it wasnt trying
Life for me was just one party and then another
I broke her heart so many times had to have my party wife
And then one night she said Sweetheart the partys over
Turn out the lights the partys over
They say that all good things must end
Call it a night the partys over
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again
And tomorrow starts the same old thing again
