This ole house once knew his children
This ole house once knew his wife
This ole house was home and comfort
As they fought the storms of life
This old house once rang with laughter
This old house heard many shouts
Now he trembles in the darkness
When the lightnin walks about
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Aint agonna need this house no more
Aint got time to fix the shingles
Aint got time to fix the floor
Aint got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Hes agettin ready to meet the saints
This ole house is agettin shaky
This ole house is agettin old
This ole house lets in the rain
This ole house lets in the cold
On his knees Im gettin chilly
But he feel no fear nor pain
Cause he see an angel peekin
Through a broken windowpane
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Aint agonna need this house no more
Aint got time to fix the shingles
Aint got time to fix the floor
Aint got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Hes agettin ready to meet the saints
This ole house is afraid of thunder
This ole house is afraid of storms
This ole house just groans and trembles
When the night wind flings its arms
This ole house is gettin feeble
This old house is needin paint
Just like him its tuckered out
But hes agettin ready to meet the saints
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Aint agonna need this house no more
Aint got time to fix the shingles
Aint got time to fix the floor
Aint got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Hes agettin ready to meet the saints
This ole house dog lies asleepin
He dont know Im gonna leave
Else hed wake up by the fireplace
And hed sit there and howl and grieve
But my huntin days are over
Aint gonna hunt the coon no more
Gabriel done brought in my chariot
When the wind blew down the door
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Aint agonna need this house no more
Aint got time to fix the shingles
Aint got time to fix the floor
Aint got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend the windowpane
Aint agonna need this house no longer
Hes agettin ready to meet the saints
