Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothing shines upon
Then you show your little light
Twinkle twinkle all the night
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Then the traveler in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark
He could not see which way to go
If you did not twinkle so
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
In the dark blue sky you keep
While you throw my window peep
And you never shut your eye
Till the sun is in the sky
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
