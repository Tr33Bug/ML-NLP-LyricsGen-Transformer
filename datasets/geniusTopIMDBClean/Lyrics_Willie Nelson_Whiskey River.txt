Whiskey River take my mind
Dont let her memry torture me
Whiskey River dont run dry
Youre all Ive got take care of me
Whiskey River take my mind
Dont let her memry torture me
Whiskey River dont run dry
Youre all Ive got take care of me
Im drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my memried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold
Whiskey River take my mind
Dont let her memry torture me
Whiskey River dont run dry
Youre all Ive got take care of me
