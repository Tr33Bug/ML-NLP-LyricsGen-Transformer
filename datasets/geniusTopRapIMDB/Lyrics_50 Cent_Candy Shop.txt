TranslationsРусскийPortuguêsCandy Shop Lyrics[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, uh-huh
So seductive

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop (Yeah)
Want one taste of what I got? (Uh-huh)
I'll have you spendin' all you got (Come on)
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand, ha-ha

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah

Girl, what we do (What we do)
And where we do (And where we do)
The things we do (Things we do)
Are just between me and you, yeah (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, woah60Embed
