Click Clack Pow Officer Down Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's on now, nigga
Welcome to hell
My hood, there's no telling
What they do to you
Across the street from Lucifer, he's only tough who...
Stupid nigga, you be using the blame
When the fif start to flame you'll be losing your brain

[Bridge]
And your boss is a bitch
He snitched on Levar
Junebug's a fucking flunky
I don't trust him, either
[Chorus 1]
Eeney meeney miney mo
Catch a piggy by the toe
Click clack pow, officer down
Eeney meeney miney mo
Catch a piggy by the toe
Click clack pow, officer down

[Bridge]
And your boss is a bitch
He snitched on Levar
Junebug's a fucking flunky
I don't trust him, either

[Verse 2]
On the block, knocking down, taking shit getting real
In the block takin streets, Spin head for the hills
Now you talk that shit, but is you bout it dog
Respect the full rank, you ain't know lil dog

[Chorus 2]
Eeney meeney miney mo
If you catch a piggie when you get it let it go
And get on down along the road
Eeney meeney miney mo
Eeney meeney miney mo
