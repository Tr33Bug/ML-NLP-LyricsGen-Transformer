Donâ€™t Push Me Lyrics[Produced by Eminem]

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading 'cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Til my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier
You might also like[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
