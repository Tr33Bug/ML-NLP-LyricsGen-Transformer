Ghetto Quâ€™ran (Forgive Me) Lyrics[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, Southside
Now what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)
[Verse 1]
Yo, when you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
See Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh-huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
They rolled with E-Z Wider then, they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack, I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Gus was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like L.A. and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)
You might also like[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man, I'ma get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Types to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but, son, I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asians
Feds couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)
[Verse 3]
Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time, I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley, Ronnie Bumps and Chick, shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up, I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news, you see players in this game, they lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Luc, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster at Benihana's
Heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you, the MAC will

[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)19Embed
