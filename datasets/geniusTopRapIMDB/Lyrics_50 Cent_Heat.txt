Heat Lyrics[Intro Skit]
Man 1 : Aye, you want some of this shit?
Man 2 :  Naw, I don't want that shit
Man 1 :  I don't give a fuck. I don't play that shit, and I'm finna' buss a cap in a nigga
Man 2 : Man, shut the fuck up! Whoa! Slow down, slow down, slow down! You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga crib. When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up. I'ma get in the other car. Aight
Car revs up
Gunshots

[Chorus]
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
[Verse 1]
Keep thinking I'm candy 'til ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying "Lord, Jesus help me" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun till you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me
'Cause I get tired of looking for ya
Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me

[Chorus]
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing

My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind
I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains

[Chorus]
If there's beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
I'll ride by and blow ya brains out
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
I'll kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playing
Catch you slipping I'ma kill you
I ain't playing, hear what I'm saying, homie I ain't playing
[Bridge]
After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me (best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot, I suggest you don't go testing me (testing me)
All the wrong I've done, the Lord still keep on blessing me (blessing me)
Finna run rap 'cause Dr. Dre got the recipe (recipe, recipe)

[Outro]
Yeah, ha ha, aye Dre
You got me feeling real bulletproof up in this motherfucker
'Cause the windows on my motherfucking Benz is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking vest is bulletproof, nigga
'Cause my motherfucking hat is bulletproof, nigga
But the Doc said if I get hit, I might get a fucking concussion
But better that than a hole in the head right, nigga? Ha ha ha ha28Embed
