[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I took quarter waters, sold it in bottles for two bucks
Then, Coca-Cola came and bought it for billions—what the fuck?
Have a baby by me, baby—be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes—who the fuck cares? (Ow!)
I'm stanky-rich, I'ma die tryna spend this shit
Southside's up in this bitch
Yeah, I smell like the vault, I used to sell dope
I did play the block, now I play on boats (Yeah)
In the south of France, baby, Saint-Tropez
Get a tan, I'm already Black; rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a riddle, rat, shit, fuck the chitter-chat (Ooh, ooh!)
I'm the baker, I bake the bread; the barber, I cut your head
The marksman, I spray the lead, I bloodclaat-chop your leg
Do not fuck with the kid
I get biz with the Sig, I come where you live—you dig? (Oh!)

You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new, though
I got rid of my old bitch; now, I got new hoes (Woo!)
First, it was the Benzo; now, I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari—I'm sorry, I keep blowing up (Oh!)
They call me the cake man, the strawberry-shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole clique breakdance (Yeah)
Backspin, head-spin, flatline, you're dead, then
Nine shells, Mac-10—who wan' get it cracking?
I was young, I couldn't do good; now, I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag? I just buy the new Jag
Now, nigga, why you mad?
Oh, you can't do that? I'm so forgetful
They calling me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they calling me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck, man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like "Blaow!, you like my style
Ha, ha! I'm heading to the bank right now

Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a Teflon Don, boy, I run New York
When I come out ofcourt, yeah, I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have you outlined in chalk (I, I get it)
In the hood if you ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread (I, I get it)
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell you they love the kid (I, I get it)
