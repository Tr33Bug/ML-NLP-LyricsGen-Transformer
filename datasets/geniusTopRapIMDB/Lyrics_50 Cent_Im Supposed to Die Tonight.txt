Iâ€™m Supposed to Die Tonight Lyrics[Intro]
Ah-ha man! Ayy you know where them niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like this shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin' (Uh-huh), straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight
[Verse 1]
This is not new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old MAC, new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my TEC
Go on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' with son
'Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like this shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight

In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
Yeah!

[Chorus]
All through the hood I keep hearin' niggas sayin' (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin' like this shit okay (Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap)
I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin', straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'
Somebody gon' die tonight20Embed
