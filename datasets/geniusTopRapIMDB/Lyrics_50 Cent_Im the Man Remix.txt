Iâ€™m the Man (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: 50 Cent]
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We tryna make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'ma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'til I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop
[Interlude: Chris Brown]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Ayy, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money, shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch a come up, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a hoe
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shawty wanna fuck with me
Strippin', yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Later, she gon' hit my line
We ain't gon' waste no time
She suckin' and we fuckin' like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy
All the light in the room from the T.V.
We gettin' it on then I'm gone
It's the type of shit that a nigga be on

[Pre-Hook: 50 Cent]
Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Lookin' for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my .9 right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fuckin' round right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Came in the game gettin' money
I fuck with all the bitches gettin' money
But you love playin' games with the corny shit
Messin' with a nigga, only bought it 'cause I want it
You love to see a nigga at the bottom
You tried to come up, you don't keep it on the low
They like a drug, don't like you to call them hoes
I'm tryna break a booty down like 36 O's
I think I love a big fat A-O-D, make that bitch cum for free
Look at mommy shake it, I'ma call her, she gon' hit my line, fall in love every time
But if I don't pay, she gon' leave me, never had a real reason, all I get is bits and pieces
And I believe it, I ain't think this shit was easy, who am I now?

Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
