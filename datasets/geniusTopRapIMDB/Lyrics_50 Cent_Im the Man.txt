Iâ€™m the Man Lyrics[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I came in the world cryin' and fussin'
Nigga, we ain't have nothin'
Every ghetto I know the same
We trying to make a little change
Preacher man come around talkin'
I don't wanna hear it, keep walkin'
I'ma put the powder in the pot
Whip it 'till I'm pullin' off a lot
Imagine when I pull it off the lot
New shit come without a top
Once I'm on I ain't never gon' stop
Bitch, I'm on, I ain't never gon' stop
[Interlude: Sonny Digital]
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Aye, came in the game gettin' money
Flippin' chickens, whip it, gettin' money
Niggas get to playin' with the money
Clique bang for the money
Shit changed over money
They love to see a nigga on the bottom
Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole
Wanna break the bitch down into 36 O's
Looky here, bitch, I'm A-okay
Shorty wanna fuck with me
Stripping, yeah, the jiggy, nigga
Lady, she gon' hit my line
We ain't gon' waste no time
She sucking and we fucking like she need me
While she make a bankroll easy
All the light in the room from the T.V
We gettin' it on then I'm gone
It's the type of shit that a nigga be on

[Pre-Hook: 50 Cent]
Too much on my mind right now
I'm on the grind right now
Looking for me, sucker, then I need to be found right now
I got my nine right now
Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now
I ain't fucking around right now
Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm a bonafide grade A hustler
A1, day 1, they can't touch us
Nigga like me, I be with the shit
Try and stick me I'ma get you hit
Yeah, you know just how I get down
Bad bitches around, they smoking and they drinking
And I'm thinking it can all work out
Seen your bitch back blown out
It's never nothing personal, believe me
I fuck around, your bitch don't wanna leave me
She talking 'bout takin' flights tonight when I'm out of town
Not around, she want me to fly in to put it down
It's nothing to a real nigga, had that ass flying in first class
'Cause you seem to be regular, she don't want nothing regular
Turn me on when she talk Spanish, that fat ass
You know I wanna get with it, so lady let's get it

Bitch, I'll blow your mind right now

Better get in line right now
Or fuck around and die right now
Hope you understand that
