Translations50 Cent - Just a Lil’ Bit (Tradução em Português)Just a Lil’ Bit Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit
Damn, baby, all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to workin' that back
Girl, shake that thang, yeah work that thang
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go 'round and 'round
[Verse 1]
I step up in the club, I'm like "Who you with?"
G-Unit in the house, yeah, that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin' old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up, boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk, nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mine's in this bitch
I ain't tryna beef, I'm tryna get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'ma get in shawty ear and I'ma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot, baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, in a lil' bit

[Verse 2]
This is 50 comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though 'cause I switched the flow
Eyes a lil' low 'cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll 'cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me, dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Now Captain, come on and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed, that's without a doubt
But shawty shake that thang like a pro, man
She backed it up on me I'm like "Oh, man"
I got close enough to her, so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot, baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, in a lil' bit

[Bridge]
Baby, you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone, you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin', I'm tryna fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, come on, ha-ha

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot, baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, in a lil' bit
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot, baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, in a lil' bit34Embed
