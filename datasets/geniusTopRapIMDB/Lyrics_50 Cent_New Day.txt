New Day Lyrics[Intro]
It don't take much strength to pull a trigger
But try to get up every morning day after day and work for a living
Let's see 'em try that
Then we'll see who's the real tough guy
The working man is a tough guy

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ayy, it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I woke up this morning thinkin' 'bout the old me
When I was feeling like Miller Lite and Ol' E
But now I ride on some conscious shit
I'm getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I could have a problem with is myself
That's probably why my only competition is myself
From today to tomorrow, the Doc is just rocking the same drum
Fuck the past, though I ain't forgot where I came from
I got the club rocking, uh
I got your girl jocking, uh
Me and Fif' still in this bitch, bitch
We goin' the distance with you party people, come on

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & 50 Cent]
Party people say, party people say
Ayy, it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy (Yeah)
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now, you can get your knees on the church floor, pray it getï»¿ better
Or push the dough on the liquor store and see where it get ya
But me, I got to be on top
I said, me I got to be on top
I got the street on lock
I'm on automatic pilot, ain't nobody stopping me
Growing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny
Niggas ride, I don't hide, I dump to get 'em off of me
I'm a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I'm from the bottom
Soon as I spot 'em, I get to drop 'em and I got 'em
I count my peace and red-dot 'em
It's dinner time when the nine come out
It's off with the chain, off with the ring
Move, bang, off with ya brain

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Marks on the wall
It's now or never at all
I'm gonna give it my all (Oh, oh)
Whether I rise or fall (Oh, oh)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
True story, I said I'd get rich or die trying
I did it, good luck sucker, trying to stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music, music my first love
We paper chasing, I'm always coming in first, 'cause
I'm built for it, see I'm better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I'm coming to get ya
I got to win, Em watch and Dre watch and my son watchin'
Fuck that, losing ain't an option
I'm sharp I'm on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
I'm back on my A-game
I'm focused, for me, this is just another victory
Except that I'm stronger than an ox now, mentally
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ayy, it's a new day, it's a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
