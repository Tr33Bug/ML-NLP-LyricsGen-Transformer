No Romeo No Juliet Lyrics[Chorus: 50 Cent with Chris Brown]
Ayo, quit Captain Savin', serenadin' them hoes
She no Juliet for no Romeo with no dough
She report to pimpin', now back to trickin'
She report to pimpin', nigga back to trickin'

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Hey ho, get back to twerkin', back to workin' (Yeah)
Get back to strippin', they back to tippin' (Woo!)
Them stacks is fallin', they back to ballin' (Come on)
Them bottles is poppin', bitch, the mall is callin' us
Quit fuckin' around, not playin' around, bitch, shit is for real (For real)
Quick makin' a stack, bag make us a mill, I mean, get us a deal (Come on)
Bitch, fix us a meal, tell me how does it feel?
On the social network when they say a nigga really ain't got no chill
[Pre-Chorus: 50 Cent with Chris Brown]
He think he fuckin' my bitch, nigga, that bitch for rent

She says you a sweetheart, a sweetheart
Things tend to go a little different 'round here, we pimpin' nigga

P.I.M.P., who the shotta them?

Have the homies come through, 400, that be the block (Fruits)
Tag yo' shit, we goin' up on the Instagram
Higher than a ceilin' fan
I'm whippin' bricks in the kitchen
I'm flyin' shit out the window like I was Peter Pan
I handle my own shit, I own shit
Alone shit, middle finger to the middle man
Anybody that can get it when they want it
Finger fuckin' bitches, she gon tell me when she cummin'
50 in this bitch and I ain't askin' him for nothin'
That's my OG, if a nigga trippin', get to bustin'
Mo' money mean mo' problems
If your nigga got the money, we gon' rob him
Boy, I'm simply, a P.I.M.P
And I'ma let it go 'til the clip go empty (Wow!)
