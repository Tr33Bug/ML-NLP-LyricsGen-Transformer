P.I.M.P (G-Unit Remix) Lyrics[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She's feeding fools fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country; think she like me cause I'm from New York?
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch: hit the track, catch a date, and come pay the kid
Look baby, this is simple, you can't see?
You fuckin' with me you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[50 Cent]
G-G-G-mixxxx!

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
F-I-F-T-Y C-E-N-T and S-N double O-P
Doggy style in your mouth for the 2003
And y'all know I'm from the DPG

F-I-F-T-Y C-E-N-T and S-N double O-P
We internationally known and locally respected
(And you know you're just a P.I.M.P!)
Now what you know about me?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah bitch, I got my Now and Later gators on
I'm bout to show you how my pimp hand is way strong
Your dead wrong if you think that pimpin' gonna die
12-piece with a hundred hoes by my side
I'm down with that nigga 50 like I'm down with blue
(We love you Snoop Dogg!) Yeah, I love you too
G-U-N-I-Tizzy, fuckin' with me and the D-P-Gizzy
Niggas in New York know how Doggy get down
I got my niggas in Queens, I got my bitches Uptown
I got my business in Manhattan, I ain't fuckin' around
I got some butter pecan Puerto Ricans from the Boogie Down
That's waiting on me to return
So they can snatch these braids out and put my shit in a perm. Word
They love it when I get to crippin'
And spitting this mag-ah-ni-ficent pimpin'
You might also like[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a blunt up outta me
I drive Cadillac, wear a perm, cus I'm a G
That I'm a motherfuckin' C-R-I-P

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You need to switch over and ride with a star
It'll get you far
I'm a P-I-M-P G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R
Yeah, I'm young, but I ain't dumb
Got some tricks, but I ain't one
I'm a guerrilla for scrilla, I trip you, you try to run
I let 'em do as they please, as long as they get my cheese
Even if they gotta freeze, or if it's a hundred degrees
I keep 'em on they knees, take a look under my sleeve
I ain't gotta give 'em much, they're happy with Mickey D's, PIMP

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
We keep it pimpin' in the South, you know how it go (dirty dirty!)
We drive old-school, white walls with mink floors
I spin the G-Unit piece, and get em' dizzy
Handcuff her if you love her or your girl coming with me
When your neck and wrist glow, she already should know
That money make the world go round, so lets get mo'
It's time to show these playas how it should be done
You got pimp potential, you might/could be one, G-UNIT!
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar outta me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Outro: 50 Cent]
In Hollywood, they say "there's no business like show business
In the hood, they say, "there's no business like ho business"
They say I talk a lil' fast, but if you listen a lil' faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch!17Embed
