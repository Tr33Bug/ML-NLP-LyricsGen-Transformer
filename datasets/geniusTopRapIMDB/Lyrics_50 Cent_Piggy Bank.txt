Piggy Bank Lyrics[Produced by Needlz]

[Chorus]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank

[Refrain]
Man, I’ll get at you! My knife cuts your skin
I’ll get at you! Blow shots at your man
I’ll get at you! 2Pac don’t pretend
I’ll get at you! I’ll put that to an end
[Verse 1]
That damn shit is old, don’t be screamin’ “Get at Me Dog”
Have you runnin’ for your life when I match ya part
I get to wavin’ that semi like it’s legal
A lil’ nigga hurt his arm, lettin’ off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol’ black nine
I’ll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol’ chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C’mon on man, you know how I shine
I’m in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns, a 100 clips, why I don’t hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought “Lean Back” was “In da Club”
My shit sold eleven mill’, his shit was a dud
Jada’ don’t fuck with me, if you wanna eat
Cause I’ll do yo’ little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
Yeah homey in New York niggas like your vocals
But that’s only New York dawg, yo’ ass is local

[Chorus]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money

Banks’ shit, sells; Buck’s shit, sells
Game’s shit, sells; I’m rich as hell
Shyne poppin’ off his mouth from a cell
He don’t want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I’m in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It’s an emergency, for Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you, cuz
First thing they say about you is you’s a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I’ll give you what I got

[Chorus]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money
Yeah, yeah-yeah! Get more money, more money
[Refrain]
When I get at you, I’ll punch out your grill
I’ll get at you! Let off that blue steel
I’ll get at you! Nigga, I’m for real
I’ll get at you! Could get yo’ ass killed

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeahhhhhh
Hahahaha
Ya’ll niggas gotta do somethin' now man
All that shoot ‘em up shit ya’ll be talkin’
You gotta do somethin' baby
I mean, I mean c'mon man everybody’s listenin'
Nigga everybody’s listenin'
Hahahahahahaha
I know you ain’t gon' just let 50 do you like that
I mean damn rep your hood nigga
Nigga, you hard right?
Pop off
Yayo give my orders to my niggas on the phone
And tell the niggas I said clip up
Niggas got a green light on these monkies
