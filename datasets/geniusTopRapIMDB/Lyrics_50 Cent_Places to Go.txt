Places to Go Lyrics[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, Shady
Aftermath
G-Unit!

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
I got places to go (Uh-uh), got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me (No)
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you (Come on!)
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me (Not me, nigga)
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you (50!)
[Verse 1: 50 Cent & Eminem]
You mistakin' me for somebody that you should be testin'
You should be stressin', I'm finna fuckin' teach you a lesson (Yeah)
Rap 101's in session, Em laced the track that I'm blessin'
Smith & Wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin', escape lesson (God, damn!)
Cappin' 'em, kept in my Benz, hot beginnin' to end (Woo!)
Watch the 22's spin, my hoes they perfect ten (Come on!)
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best, don't you get it? Forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in yo' ass, bitch
If it's not a classic, when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered, stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard (Yeah)
When measures get drastic, Glocks made out of plastic
Cock it, aim it, blast it, run nigga, now stash it (Come on!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you

If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
I'ma drink 'til I get to that bitch (Come on!)
Em and Dre gonna introduce me to the 'burbs
They gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit (Break it down!)
[Verse 2: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
Picture a perfect picture, picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me startin' shit (Uh-uh), picture me bustin' my gat
Picture police mad, they ain't got a picture of that
Picture me bein' broke, picture me smokin' a stack (Aw, shit!)
Picture me comin' up, picture me rich from rap (Uh-uh)
Picture me blowin' up, now picture me goin' back (Woo!)
To my momma basement to live, shit, picture that
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target, Jack (Uh-uh)
Hustle hard, money stack (Woo!), sell that dope, sell that crack (Come on!)
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back (Yeah, yeah)
50 Cent, too much Henny, man I'm bent, I'm outta here

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
I got places to go, got people to see (Yeah)
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warnin' you, do not tempt me
I'll run up, squeeze and put a hole in you
[Outro: 50 Cent]
Ha-ha, man, I ain't' goin' to jail, not even to visit a nigga
You wanna holler at me, you write me
Matter of fact, you gotta send it to Sunset Boulevard up in the Mondrian (Ha-ha-ha)
Ridin' 'round in one of Dre's Ferraris, nigga
Oh, matter of fact, I might be in Detroit ridin' down 8 Mile Road
You know, to one of Em's joints and shit (Ha-ha)
Ya heard? I got places to go, man, you know
Shady/Aftermath, we finna start printin' money (He-he-he-he)
Puttin' Em's face on these motherfuckin' bills, shit (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
Ain't shit you can do about it9Embed
