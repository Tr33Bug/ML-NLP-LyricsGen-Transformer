Still Think Iâ€™m Nothing Lyrics[Intro: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
Oh yeah
Look at you, you lil' dirty ass nigga you ain't shit
Ouuh
Bongo By The Way

[Chorus: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now
I'm up nigga
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I ever said fuck you nigga I meant to
When you come up how I came up, life's not gentle
See that tear in my mama eye, that meant the rent due
I prayed on it, God didn't say nothing back
Saw that cocaine you had, we turned it to crack
Had a couple grams of diesel, we was just tryna make it
A brown sheepskin on, niggas was tryna' take it
You know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber
Niggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama
Suckers shit niggas get shot over some nah, nah
If niggas want problems I'm sayin' this no problem
I catch 'em on the late night and dearly depart 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Look back
Look where we started from
It's all the beginning
They ain't tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When it's 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when...

[Chorus: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now
I'm up nigga

I remember all the shit you said to me 'cause it hurt me
Then it helped me 'cause then I was down to do the dirt
See the knots in my pockets boy, I go the cash route
I see you with your skinny jeans, punk, with your ass out
And I got all kind of money now
Look what you made me
Got a different type of temper, man a nigga get crazy
My A.P. look like I done dipped it in water, hard
Like me when I done dipped in your daughter (GOD!)
From playin' with Hot Wheels to collecting cars
That shit in the duPont REGISTRY's in my yard
Somehow the bullshit shifted
Now the motherfuckers calling me gifted
And I be like

[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Look back
Look where we started from
It's all the beginning
They ain't tell me why we come this far
Now they feel it in the air
When it's 2AM and the sky is filled with stars
Driving down the boulevard
I remember when...
[Chorus: Jeremih & 50 Cent]
They used to tell me that I wouldn't be nothing
Yeah
Now Lamborghinis and Porsches we stunting
Look at me now nigga
Pull up, get your bitch, in drop top we roll out
Y'all niggas ain't shit
They all act like they ain't know bet they know now
I'm up nigga12Embed
