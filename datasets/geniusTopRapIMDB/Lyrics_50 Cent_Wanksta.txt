Wanksta Lyrics[Produced by J-Praize]

[Intro]
Woo! Yeah
It's 50 a.k.a. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of livin' to do 'fore I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

[Verse 1]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't no friend of mine (Yeah!), you ain't no kin of mine (C'mon!)
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9? (Uh-huh)
We do this all the time (What?), right now we on the grind (Yeah)
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes (Uh-huh)
Shorty, she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo!)
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
The D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes
[Chorus]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'

[Verse 2]
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar (Uh-huh)
Nigga, you play with my paper, you gon' meet my Beretta
Now Shorty think I'ma sweat her (Uh-huh) sippin' on Amaretto (Yeah)
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same old two-step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

[Chorus]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you don't never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You might also like[Bridge]
Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman (Yeah), me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV

[Verse 3]
'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy (Woo!)
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they gon' murk 50, how?
We ridin' 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

[Chorus]
You say you gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin'
[Outro]
Aha! Damn, homie28Embed
