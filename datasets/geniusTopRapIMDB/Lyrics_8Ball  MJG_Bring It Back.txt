Bring It Back Lyrics[Intro: Nitti]
Oh, I know what they won't do. Uh-Oh Yeah-Yea
Oh, It's bout to be a problem (that's right) It's your boy Nitti
I'm with my big bruh 8 ball and MJG
It's that new shit nigga (wow)
Let's go

[Hook: 8ball]
What it sound like - sound like money (like money)
What it look like - look like money (like money)
What it feel like - feel like money (like money) (ayye)
What it is real life make a nigga money
Tell the dj bring it back (tell the dj bring it back)
Tell the dj bring it back (tell the dj bring it back)
Tell the dj bring it back (tell the dj bring it back)
Tell the dj bring it back (tell the dj bring it back)

[Verse 1: 8ball]
What it sound like crispy 20's being counted out
Shout it out mayne we done made it through another drought
Celebrate haters can't bring me down if you want do it
Not chu fixin to see me now all in face yea with my gold mouth
There niggas thought we was gone like J.D hair but we still in your ear
Throwing memphis in the air on the space shuttle weed got me way up there
I swear I ain't rich but I feel like a billionaire hustle to I die
Yea fuck around and but it there one licks two licks three licks four
Keep hit licks like I'm playin' a guitar

[Hook]

[Verse 2: MJG]

[Verse 3: Young Dro]
I got all kind of cash, yes, gold rover range
The girls sell me fast, road runner brings (beep beep)
Dro and Eightball in a whole 'nother lane (watch out)
The trap taking MJG, a whole 'nother theme
Chevy with the [?] dont forget to spray it down
Coming out hard, tell them bitches lay it down
My wrist weigh a pound, I got stupid ass jewelry
Gettin Quarter mil, in the coupe it's that serious
I hit a hatin, hatin I got superman hear
Blue and Red Lamborghini, Superman gear
Polo Polo Polo I been doin' that for years
If you smell like money, you can touch it don't be scared Young Dro
