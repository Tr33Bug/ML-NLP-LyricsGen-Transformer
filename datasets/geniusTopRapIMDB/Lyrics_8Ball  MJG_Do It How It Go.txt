Do It How It Go Lyrics[Intro: 8Ball]
Drop It

[Intro: MJG]
Ahhhhhhhhhh
On the mother fuckin' one
Hey mane, You know what mane
Nigga walk up to me mane
You know what he did mane
You know asking me about how I keep mother fucking game so tight
Shit mane you know he wanna' know how he get his
Doin' they little game on the side and shit
I told him I don't know why ya'll be doin' that shit man
Keep that shit rolling like for so long and on, longevity and shit man you know
Nigga I told him ya'll gotta know how to do it mane
You gotta do that shit how it go nigga
[Verse 1: 8Ball]
I'm just a Tennessee nigga straight from Orange Mound
Gangster walking, trying to stack my cheese and put it down
The world ain't ready for the drama that we bringing
The shit that we be saying, cause they don't know the meaning
I was lost mane and ain't nobody found me yet
I'm royalty but them bitches ain't crowned me yet
I told 'em once hard times ain't no hurting from me
I'm 8Ball nigga now look out for MJG

[Verse 2: MJG]
Up in your shit mane thinking about sticking the flag in
Phony ass tricks be flossing and braggin'
'Bout bitches they done fucked and places they have been
You get it cause they know when you hit it you cash in
Nigga don't be telling me you that you staying above the bitch
When all the time dumb and you secretly love the bitch
Them drugs and shit
That must affected ya'll strongly
I got one woman and don't no[?] bitch own me

[Chorus]
Boys want to be men but act like ho's
Ho's want a nigga tricking off his dough
Pimps and gangsters do whatever for the dough
Tricks and busters do whatever for a ho
Lame niggas slip cause they game too slow
If you not hustling for some paper what you husting fo'
Don't trip cause a nigga like me don't fold
Get it how you live nigga
Do it how it go

Big shot nigga boss on my own commission
Space age pimpin' take you to another dimension
Fast living on the Audubon headed for death
A nigga ain't gon' have shit if I don't get it myself
Stone face to a nigga think he know about me
I'm the fat one the skinny nigga MJG
Flipping with Charlie Hustle when I'm in Northern Cali'
B-legit, got that sticky green, choke a nigga salad
Split one, roll it up, spark it up
Hold it for a second, then bark it up
8Ball known to rock a nigga world slanging verses
Leaving nigga's and they bitches face down riding hearses
No mercy how it come to me and that's how I be giving it
Hard is how I'm living bitch and that's why I be writing it
Rob a mother fucker, mass murder, dope slangin'
Straight pimp gaming, keeping ho's entertainin'

[Verse 4: MJG]
Boys want to be men but act like ho's
But then ho's want to be men and wear boys clothes
We cream of the crop
Certified finest ones
When did we drop
Nineteen Ninety-one
And what did we see
We saw ourselves doing this shit
And what did we know
Niggas going try to ruin this shit
I'm riding with God
Protected by an untouchable squad
You rushing me hard
I'm bout to pull this buzz in your yard
And make a command and dance all over your grass
Suave House nigga's ran all over your ass
You broke and you mad
Found out your wife a ho and you sad
Crying and shit, like a bitch give him a rag
Not for his eyes, he need them for his panties and shit
Faggot sitting down to piss, instead of standing and shit
Trip I'm a pimp type nig-a-roll
Slash gigolo
Ask me how I do it
How you do it
How it go, nigga
[Chorus]
Boys want to be men but act like ho's
Ho's want a nigga tricking off his dough
Pimps and gangsters do whatever for the dough
Tricks and busters do whatever for a ho
Lame niggas slip cause they game too slow
If you not hustling for some paper what you husting fo'
Don't trip cause a nigga like me don't fold
Get it how you live nigga
Do it how it go2Embed
