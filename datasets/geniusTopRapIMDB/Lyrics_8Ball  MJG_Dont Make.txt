Don’t Make Lyrics[Chorus - MJG]
Don't make(don't make)
Me kill(me kill)
No muthafuckin body in here(in here)
Ima shoot(ima shoot)
Three shots(three shots)
Somebody done made me hot(me hot)

Don't make(don't make)
Me kill(me kill)
No muthafuckin body in here(in here)
Ima shoot(ima shoot)
Three shots(three shots)
Somebody done made me hot(me hot)
[Verse - MJG]
You got me fucked up, we shoot guns and hit targets
Meat market, chop haters up who start shit
M.J.G., rippin holes in body gaurds
Outta line, polices and boys who think they body hard
And when the party started, I thought we was all chillin
I figured that everybody be leavin here all livin
You standin to close partna, you askin too much baby
You need to get way from round me, before our clique goin crazy

[Eightball]
Yeah mane, these niggas comin' ’round, talkin' bout
They hot, but they not, fuckin with fat boy and MJ
Nigga we the truth, holla at a playa man
Streets are the booth, we poppin at you hatas man
Soft ass niggas make they chin hit the floor
Off bran niggas take they cheese and they hoe
Mafio (mafio), Niggas know (niggas know)
When them real live g's hit the door (hit the door)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - MJG]
I got a 22, not much bigger than my finger
A winchester pistol grip pump thats a head ringer
A two shot derringer, not little millinater
A big 40 Glock, just call me the gun slanger
Some AK spray to kill the front line
One houndred and thirty dead from squeezin off one time
All you muthafuckin niggas, that yappin that fly lip
Let it rip, don't slip, I'm workin with fly clips
You might also like[Eightball]
We fifty deep and every nigga with me got they ice on
Hood niggas that'll brake your face like Roy Jones
Crushin' bones when it's on, we ain't never scared
Them Memphis boys, be so serious when its bout that bread
Kidnap family members, them niggas don't leave no witness
They all love a gangsta, that shit be so addictive
When we pull up, they know who we are by the car
We blowin big, and you know Diddy he gonna buy the bar

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - MJG]
Take your vest off, I'm blowin your neck off and eyes out
High speed chase, I'll follow you to your hideout
Shoot your fuckin tires out, don't try to ride now
What happend to the bass in your voice, you just cryin now
Thought you was a man, you starting to look fine now
The grim reaper been lookin for ya, and boy its time now
To blow the whole shit out the right side of your head man
Ain't no way for retaliation when yous'a dead man

Not a scared man, we keep it, out the frame
We stayin away from lames, and run the whole game
I do it like G, you ain't, fuckin with me
Eightball, MJG, we reppin for Tennesee
With murder and homicide, and daily, niggas die
And daily, niggas ride, ain't no need to reason why, it’s
Money, and the power, the weak, they get devoured
Them boys that disrespect, with bullets they get showered
[Chorus repeat x 3]
